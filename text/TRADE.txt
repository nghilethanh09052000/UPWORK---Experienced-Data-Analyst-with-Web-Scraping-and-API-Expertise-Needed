TRADE SKILLS4U LTD

DIRECTORS' RESPONSIBILITIES STATEMENT
FOR THE PERIOD ENDED 31 AUGUST 2023

The directors are responsible for preparing the Directors’ Report and the financial statements in accordance with
applicable law and regulations.

Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the
directors have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and appticable law). Under company law the directors
must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of
affairs of the company and of the profit or loss’ of the company for that period. In preparing these financial
statements, the directors are required to:

* select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;

* make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;

* prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the
company will continue in business.

The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the
company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company
and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.


INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF TRADE SKILLS4U LTD

Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of Trade Skills4U Ltd (the 'company’) for the period ended 31 August 2023
which comprise the statement of comprehensive income, the statement of financial position, the statement of
changes in equity and notes to the financial statements, including significant accounting policies. The financial
teporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting
Standards, including FRS 102 "The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of
Ireland" (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

In our opinion, the financial statements:
* give a true and fair view of the state of the company's affairs as at 31 August 2023 and of its loss for the period
then ended;
* have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice;
* have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable
law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of
the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the company in accordance with the ethical
requirements that are relevant to our audit of thé financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical
Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe
that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Conclusions relating to going concern

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of
accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

.Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or
conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going
concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the. directors with respect to going concern are described in the
relevant sections of this report.

Other information

The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements
and our auditor's report thereon: The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual
report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other. information and, except to the extent
otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is
materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit or
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material
misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial
statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material
misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.

Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
* the information given in the directors’ report for the financial period for which the financial statements are
prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
* the directors’ report has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.


INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF TRADE SKILLS4U LTD
(CONTINUED)

Matters on which we are required to report by exception

In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the course of the
audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the directors’ report.

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires
us to report to you if, in our opinion:

* adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received
from branches not visited by us; or
the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
certain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or
we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
the directors were not entitled to prepare the financial statements in accordance with the small companies
regime and take advantage of the small companies exemption from the requirement to prepare a strategic
report or in preparing the directors’ report.

Responsibilities of directors

As explained more fully in the directors' responsibilities statement set out on page 3, the directors are responsible
for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such
internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are
free from material misstatement; whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the company's ability to continue
as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going ‘concern and using the going concern basis of
accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic
alternative but to do so.

Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from

material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance

with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or

error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence

the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. :

The extent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud
Irregularities are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. The objectives of our audit are to obtain
sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding compliance with laws and regulations that have a direct effect on the
determination of material amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, to perform audit procedures to help
identify instances of non-compliance with other laws and regulations that may have a material effect on the financial
statements, and to respond appropriately to identified or suspected non-compliance with laws and regulations
identified during the audit.

In relation to fraud, the objectives of our audit are to identify and assess the risk of material misstatement of the
financial statements due to fraud, to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the assessed risks of
material misstatement due to fraud through designing and implementing appropriate responses and to respond
appropriately to fraud or suspected fraud identified during the audit.

However, it is the primary responsibility of management, with the oversight of those charged with governance, to
ensure that the entity's operations are conducted in accordance with the provisions of laws and regulations and for
the prevention and detection of fraud.

In identifying and assessing risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including fraud, the audit
engagement team:
* obtained an understanding of the nature of the industry and sector, including the legal and regulatory framework
that the company operates in and how the company is complying with the legal and regulatory framework;
* inquired of management, and those charged with governance, about their own identification and assessment of
the risks of irregularities, including any known actual, suspected or alleged instances of fraud;
¢ discussed matters about non-compliance with laws and regulations and how fraud might occur including
assessment of how and where the financial statements may be susceptible to fraud.


INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF TRADE SKILLS4U LTD
(CONTINUED)

As.a result of these procedures we consider the most significant laws and regulations that have a direct impact on
the financial statements are FRS 102, the Companies Act 2006 and tax compliance regulations. We performed
audit procedures to detect non-compliances which may have a material impact on the financial statements which
included reviewing financial statement disclosures and making enquiries with external tax advisors.

The audit engagement team identified the risk of management override of controls, the occurrence of certain
revenue streams and cut-off of certain revenue streams as the areas where the financial statements were most
susceptible to materia! misstatement due to fraud. Audit procedures performed included but were not limited to
testing manual journal entries and other adjustments and evaluating the business rationale in relation to significant,
unusual transactions and transactions entered into outside the norma) course of business, testing the occurrence of
revenue by agreeing a sample of revenue items to invoice and subsequent receipt and reviewing a sample of
revenue transactions either side of the year end to ensure that revenue had been recognised in the appropriate
accounting period. .

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial
Reporting Council’s website at: https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities This description forms part of our
auditor's report.

Use of our report

This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. .

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE PERIOD ENDED 31 AUGUST 2023

1 Accounting policies

Company information
Trade Skills4U Ltd is a private company limited by shares and is registered. and incorporated.in England and
Wales. The registered office is Mitre Court, Fleming Way, Crawley, West Sussex, RH10 9JY.

Accounting convention

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 102 “The Financial Reporting
Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of. Ireland” ("FRS 102”) and the requirements of the Companies
Act 2006 as applicable to companies subject to the small companies regime. The disclosure requirements of
section 1A of FRS 102 have been applied other than where additional disclosure is required to show a true
and fair view.

The financial statements are prepared in sterling, which is the functional currency of the company. Monetary
amounts in these financial statements are rounded to the nearest £.

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention. The principal accounting
policies adopted are set out below.

Going concern
The Company made a loss of £1,154,897 (2022: profit of £114,615) and ended the period with net liabilities of
£1,784,665 (2022: £629,768). In considering the company's ability to continue as a going concern, the
directors have prepared budgets and cash flow forecasts for a period which covers more than 12 months from
the date of approval of the financial statements, which take into account the recent synergies associated with
the acquisition by City and Guilds. The business has subjected those models to a number of “stress test”
scenarios. The new ultimate parent entity, The City and Guilds of London Institute, has confirmed in writing
that it will provide the necessary support of up to £7,600,000 to ensure the TradeSkills4U group continues in
- operation in furtherance of the objectives of the wider City and Guilds Group for a period of 13 months from
the date of approval of the accounts for the year ended 31 August 2023.

The budget and forecast shows that the company is expected to meet its liabilities as they fall due for a period
of at least 12 months from the date of approval of these financial statements and the directors have
concluded that the going concern basis of preparation of these financial statements remains appropriate. The
directors have prepared the accounts on a going concern basis which they believe to be appropriate given
that the company is cash-generative and is forecast to remain so.

Reporting period

Following its acquisition in November 2022, the company changed its accounting reporting date to 31 August
in order to align with the reporting date of its new ultimate parent, The City and Guilds of London Institute.
Therefore, the current period covers the 11 month period from 1 October 2022 to 31 August 2023 and may
not be entirely comparable with the prior 12 month period ended 30 September 2022.

Turnover -

Turnover is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for services provided in the -
normal course of business, and is shown net of VAT and other sales related taxes. The fair value of
consideration takes into account trade discounts, settlement discounts and volume rebates.

Turnover in respect of the provision of training is recognised on the start date of each course, and on a
weekly basis where these span a number of weeks. As at the year end, any amounts received in respect of
courses that begin following the year end are deferred and included on the balance sheet in other creditors.

Turnover generated from the Company's e-learning offering is recognised on the date when the student draws
down the ability to access the courses, as management deem they have fulfilled their obligation to the student
at this date.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
FOR THE PERIOD ENDED 31 AUGUST 2023

1 Accounting policies (Continued)

Intangible fixed assets other than goodwill
Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are recognised at cost and are subsequently measured
at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.

Amortisation is recognised so as to write off the cost of assets less their residual values over their useful lives

on the following bases: :
Website development costs 33% straight line

Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost, net of depreciation
and any impairment losses.

Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost of assets less their residual values over their useful lives
on the following bases:

Leasehold land and buildings 20% straight line
Leasehold improvements 15% reducing balance
Plant and machinery 15%-33% straight line

The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the sale
Proceeds and the carrying value of the asset, and is credited or charged to profit or loss.

Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are basic financial instruments and include cash in hand, deposits held at call with
_ banks, and other short-term liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.

Financial instruments
The company has elected to apply the provisions of Section 11 ‘Basic Financial Instruments’ and Section 12
‘Other Financial Instruments Issues’ of FRS 102 to all of its financial instruments.

Financial instruments are recognised when the company becomes party to the contractual provisions of the
instrument.

Financial assets and liabilities are offset, with the net amounts presented in the financial statements, when
there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a
net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Basic financial assets

Basic financial assets, which include trade and other debtors and cash and bank balances, are initially
measured at transaction price including transaction costs and are subsequently carried at amortised cost
using the effective interest method unless the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where the
financial asset is measured at the present value of the future receipts discounted at a market rate of interest.

Classification of financial liabilities .

Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual
arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the
assets of the company after deducting all of its liabilities.

TRADE SKILLS4U LTD

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
FOR THE PERIOD ENDED 31 AUGUST 2023

1 Accounting policies (Continued)

Basic financial liabilities .
Basic financial liabilities, including trade and other creditors and bank loans, are initially recognised at
transaction price unless the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where the debt instrument is
measured at the present value of the future payments discounted at a market rate of interest.

Debt instruments are subsequently carried at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.

Equity instruments : .
Equity instruments issued by the company are recorded at the fair value of proceeds received, net of
transaction costs. Dividends payable on equity instruments are recognised as liabilities once they are no
longer at the discretion of the company.

Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the current tax expense and deferred tax expense. Current tax assets
are recognised when tax paid exceeds the tax payable.

Current and deferred tax is charged or credited to profit or loss, except when it relates to items charged or
credited to other comprehensive income or equity, when the tax follows the transaction or event it relates to
and is also charged or credited to other comprehensive income, or equity. .
Current tax assets and current tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset, if
and only if, there is a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and the entity intends either to settle on
the net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year. Current tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax
rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.

Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised
or the liability is settled based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting
date.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised in respect of all timing differences that exist at the reporting date. Timing
differences are differences between taxable profits and total comprehensive income that arise from the
inclusion of income and expenses in tax assessments in different periods from their recognition in the
financial statements. Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that they will be
recovered by the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.

Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the company has a legal or constructive present obligation as a result of a
past event, it is probable that the company will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can
be made of the amount of the obligation.

The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present
obligation at the reporting end date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.
Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount expected to be required to settle the
obligation is’ recognised at present value. When a provision is measured at present value, the unwinding of
the discount is recognised as a finance cost in profit or loss in the period in which it arises.

Employee benefits
The costs of short-term employee benefits are recognised as a liability and an expense.

Retirement benefits

For defined contribution schemes the amount charged to profit or loss is the contributions payable in the year.
Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown as either
accruals or prepayments.

Leases

Rentals payable under operating leases, including any lease incentives received, are charged to profit or loss
on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease except where another more systematic basis is
more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leases asset are consumed.

2 Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty

In the application of the company's accounting policies, the directors are required to make judgements,
estimates and assumptions about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other
factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting
estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised where the revision affects only that
period, or in the period of the revision and future periods where the revision affects both current and future
periods.

Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The estimates and assumptions which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying
amount of assets and liabilities are as follows.

Dilapidations provision .

The company has recognised a dilapidations provision in the balance sheet as the company has a liability to
restore its leased premises to their original condition at the expiry of the lease. The Board have used available
data and their knowledge of historic adjustments made to the sites with reference to the terms of the lease,
and have estimated that the cost of the restoration is expected to be £594,111 as at 31 August 2023 (2022:
£380,253); this will be kept under annual review.
