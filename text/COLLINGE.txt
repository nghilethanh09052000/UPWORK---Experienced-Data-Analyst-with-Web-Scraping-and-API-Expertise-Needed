Accounting policies

Company information

Collinge & Co Training Limited is a private company limited by shares incorporated in England and Wales. The registered office is
Suite 5, 3rd Floor, Castle Chambers, 43 Castle Street, Liverpool, Merseyside, L2 9SH.

Accounting convention

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 102 “The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the
UK and Republic of Ireland” (“FRS 102”) and the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 és applicable to companies subject to
the small companies regime. The disclosure requirements of section 1A of FRS 102 have been applied other than where
additional disclosure is required to show a true and fair view.

The financial statements are prepared in sterling, which is the functional currency of the company. Monetary amounts in these
financial statements are rounded to the nearest £.

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention. The principal accounting policies adopted are
set out below.

Turnover

Turnover is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods and services provided in the normal
course of business, and is shown net of VAT and other sales related taxes. The “air value of consideration takes into account trade
discounts, settlement discounts and volume rehates.

Research and development expenditure

Research expenditure is written off against profits in the year in which it is incurred. Identifiable development expenditure is
capitalised to the extent that the technical, commercial and financial feasibility can be demonstrated.

Tangible fixed assets

Tangible fixed assets are initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost or valuation, net of depreciation and any
impairment losses.

Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over their useful lives on the
following bases:

Land and buildings leasehold 10% on cost
Plant & Machinery 25% reducing balance
Fixtures, fittings & equipment 25% reducing balance/10% - 33% on cost

The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying
value of the asset, and is credited or charged to profit or loss.

Impairment of fixed assets

At each reporting period end date, the company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible assets to determine whether there
is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the
asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the
recoverable amount of an individual asset, the company estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which
the asset belongs.

Accounting policies (Continued)

Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less cos:s to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future
cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the
time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.

If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying
amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately
in profit or loss, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a
revaluation decrease.

Recognised Impairment losses are reversed if, and only If, the reasons for the impairment loss have ceased to apply. Where an
impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised
estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amourt that would
have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of
an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which
case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.

Stocks
Stock is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents are basic financial assets and include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term
liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown within
borrowings in current liabilities.

Financial instruments

The company has elected to apply the provisions of Section 11 ‘Basic Financial Instruments’ and Section 12 ‘Other Financial
Instruments Issues’ of FRS 102 to all of its financial instruments.

Financial instruments are recognised in the company's balance sheet when the company becomes party to the contractual
provisions of the instrument.

Financial assets and liabilities are offset, with the net amounts presented in the financial statements, when there is a legally
enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and
settle the liability simultaneously.

Basic financial assets

Basic financial assets, which include debtors and cash and bank balances, are initially measured at transaction price including
transaction costs and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method unless the arrangement
consti-ules a financing Lransaction, where Lhe transaction is measured al Lhe present value of the fulure receipts discounted ala
market rate of interest. Financial assets classified as receivable within one year are not amortised.

Classification of financial liabilities

Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the company after deducting all of its
liabilities.

Accounting policies (Continued)

Basic financial liabilities

Basic financial liabilities, including creditors and loans from fellow group companies are initially recognised at transaction price
unless the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where the debt instrument is measured at the present value of the
future payments discounted at a market rate of interest. Financial liabilities classified as payable within one year are not
amortised.

Debt instruments are subsequently carried at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.

Trade creditors are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from
suppliers. Amounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less. If not, they are presented
as nor-current liabilities. Trade creditors are recognised initially at transaction price and subsequently measured at amortised
cost using the effective interest method,

Financial liabilities are derecognised when the company’s contractual obligations expire or are discharged or cancelled.

Equity instruments.
Equity instruments issued by the company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of transaction costs. Dividends payable on
equity instruments are recogn sed as liabilities once they are no longer at the discretion of the company.

Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.

Current tax

The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the profit and
loss account because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes
items that are never taxable or deductible. The company’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been
enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting end date.

Deferred tax

Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all timing differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that
it is probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits. Such assets
and liabilities are not recognised if the timing difference arises from goodwill o from the initial recognition of other assets and
liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting end date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Deferred tax is calculated
at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is
charged or credited in the profit and loss account, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to ecuity, in which
case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the company has a legally
enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the
same tax authority.

Employee benefits
The costs of short-term employee benefits are recognised as a liability and an expense, unless those costs are required to be
recognised as part of the cost of stock or fixed assets.

The cost of any unused holiday entitlement is recognised in the period in which the employee’s services are received.

All staff costs and aenefits recorded in these accounts are on behalf of individuals providing services to this company but who are
actually formally employed by the holding company Andrew Collinge (Holdings) Limited.
