NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2024

1. General information

20/20 Business Insight Limited is a private company limited by shares incorporated in Scotland. The registered office is
Elevator Business Centre, Endeavour Drive, Arnhall Business Park, Westhill, Aberdeenshire, United Kingdom, AB32 6UF.

2. Accounting policies

2.1 Basis of preparation of financial statements
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention unless otherwise specified within these
accounting policies and in accordance with FRS 102 'The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and the
Republic of Ireland’ and the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. The disclosure requirements of Section 1A of FRS
102 have been applied other than where additional disclosure is required to show a true and fair view.
The following principal accounting policies have been applied:

2.2 Foreign currency translation
Functional and presentation currency
The Company's functional and presentational currency is GBP.

Transactions and balances

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the spot exchange rates at the dates of the
transactions.

At each period end foreign currency monetary items are translated using the closing rate. Non-monetary items measured
at historical cost are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction and non-monetary items measured
at fair value are measured using the exchange rate when fair value was determined.

2.3 Revenue

Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Company and the
revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is measured as the fair value of the consideration received or receivable,
excluding discounts, rebates, value added tax and other sales taxes. The following criteria must also be met before
revenue is recognised:

Rendering of services
Revenue from a contract to provide services is recognised in the period in which the services are provided in accordance
with the stage of completion of the contract when all of the following conditions are satisfied:

the amount of revenue can be measured reliably;

it is probable that the Company will receive the consideration due under the contract;

the stage of completion of the contract at the end of the reporting period can be measured reliably; and

the costs incurred and the costs to complete the contract can be measured reliably.

2.8

Research and development
In the research phase of an internal project it is not possible to demonstrate that the project will generate future economic
benefits and hence all expenditure on research shall be recognised as an expense when it is incurred. Intangible assets
are recognised from the development phase of a project if and only if certain specific criteria are met in order to
demonstrate the asset will generate probable future economic benefits and that its cost can be reliably measured. The
capitalised development costs are subsequently amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives, which
range from 3 to 6 years.

If it is not possible to distinguish between the research phase and the development phase of an internal project, the
expenditure is treated as if it were all incurred in the research phase only.

The Company recognises a research and development tax credit on an accruals basis when it is probable that any future
economic benefit will flow to the entity. If it is not probable that any future economic benefit will flow to the entity, the tax
credit will be recognised in the period the credit is received.
Interest income
Interest income is recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method.
Finance costs
Finance costs are charged to profit or loss over the term of the debt using the effective interest method so that the amount
charged is at a constant rate on the carrying amount. Issue costs are initially recognised as a reduction in the proceeds of
the associated capital instrument.
Borrowing costs
All borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the year in which they are incurred.
Pensions
Defined contribution pension plan
The Company operates a defined contribution plan for its employees. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under
which the Company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. Once the contributions have been paid the Company
has no further payment obligations.
The contributions are recognised as an expense in profit or loss when they fall due. Amounts not paid are shown in

accruals as a liability in the Balance Sheet. The assets of the plan are held separately from the Company in
independently administered funds.

Accounting policies (continued)

2.9 Current and deferred taxation

The tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in profit or loss except that a charge
attributable to an item of income and expense recognised as other comprehensive income or to an item recognised
directly in equity is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.

The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the balance sheet date in the countries where the Company operates and generates income.

Deferred tax balances are recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the
balance sheet date, except that:

The recognition of deferred tax assets is limited to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered against
the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits; and

Any deferred tax balances are reversed if and when all conditions for retaining associated tax allowances have
been met.

Deferred tax balances are not recognised in respect of permanent differences except in respect of business
combinations, when deferred tax is recognised on the differences between the fair values of assets acquired and the
future tax deductions available for them and the differences between the fair values of liabilities acquired and the amount
that will be assessed for tax. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the balance sheet date.

2.10 Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets under the cost model are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any
accumulated impairment losses. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to bringing the asset to

the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.

Depreciation is charged so as to allocate the cost of assets less their residual value over their estimated useful lives,
using the straight-line method.

Depreciation is provided on the following basis:

Leasehold improvements - 15% &6.67%
Motor vehicles - 25%
Plant and equipment - 25%

The assets’ residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted prospectively if
appropriate, or if there is an indication of a significant change since the last reporting date.

Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised
in profit or loss.

2.11 Debtors
Short-term debtors are measured at transaction price, less any impairment. Loans receivable are measured initially at fair

value, net of transaction costs, and are measured subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less
any impairment.

Accounting policies (continued)

2.12 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash is represented by cash in hand and deposits with financial institutions repayable without penalty on notice of nat
more than 24 hours. Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments that mature in no more than three months from the
date of acquisition and that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash with insignificant risk of change in value.

2.13 Creditors
Short-term creditors are measured at the transaction price. Other financial liabilities, including bank loans, are measured
initially at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are measured subsequently at amortised cost using the effective
interest method.

2.14 Holiday pay accrual
A liability is recognised to the extent of any unused holiday pay entitlement which is accrued at the balance sheet date
and carried forward to future periods. This is measured at the undiscounted salary cost of the future holiday entitlement
so accrued at the balance sheet date.

2.15 Provisions for liabilities

Provisions are recognised when an event has taken place that gives rise to a legal or constructive obligation, a transfer of
economic benefits is probable and a reliable estimate can be made.

Provisions are measured as the best estimate of the amount required to settle the obligation, taking into account the

related risks and uncertainties.

Increases in provisions are generally charged as an expense to profit or loss.

2.16 Financial instruments
The company only enters into basic financial instrument transactions that result in the recognition of financial assets and
laibilities like trade and other debtors and creditors, loans from banks and other third parties, loans to related parties and
investments in ordinary shares.

2.17 Dividends
Equity dividends are recognised when they become legally payable. Interim equity dividends are recognised when paid.
Final equity dividends are recognised when approved by the shareholders at an annual general meeting.

The average monthly number of employees, including directors, during the year was 20 (2023 - 16).

and increase in administrative costs of £48,960 during the year ended 31 March 2023.

the Company in an independently administered fund. The pension cost charge represents contributions payable by the

fund at the balance sheet date and are included in creditors.
