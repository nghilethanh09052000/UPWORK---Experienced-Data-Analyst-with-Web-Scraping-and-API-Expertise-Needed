STRATEGIC REPORT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023
- 1 -
The Directors present their Strategic Report for the year ended 31 December 2023, as follows:
Business Review
The business has had another good year, holding turnover and operating profit under challenging market conditions. There is a great deal of optimism about further future growth opportunities, and future success will continue to be grounded in upholding ongoing exceptional levels of customer service, product quality and value for money offerings in the market.
Total headcount at year end was 322
The directors consider the business to be well placed for the future.
Principal risks and uncertainties
The principal risks to the business include the following:
Operating in a very competitive marketplace
. The company has consistently demonstrated its ability to mitigate this risk through provision of high-quality products at competitive prices with strong values in customer care and reliable delivery performance.
Changes in technology
. The company mitigates this risk by continued re-investment in the latest available state of the art production equipment, allowing control of operating costs and highest levels of efficiency to maintain its position as market leader.
Economic Uncertainty
. At the date of this report, there are many uncertainties around the economic and other general impacts of recent events in Ukraine and any potential impacts on the business.
Excessive and intrusive government legislation
. A company’s ability to remain competitive in a global supply chain can be negatively affected by unnecessary legislation and “red-tape”.
Financial and other key performance indicators
During the year, various indicators were used to monitor and compare the company’s performance. The following are regarded as the key financial indicators of performance, all of which can be observed in the attached financial statements. The company uses other performance indicators in its day to day operations but the directors consider these commercially sensitive and they are therefore not specifically disclosed.
-    Turnover £42.9 million (2022: £43.1 million)
-    Gross Margin 33.7%
(2022: 32.8%)
-    Operating Profit £5.35 million
(2022: £5.42 million)

Stakeholder Engagement
The directors have a responsibility under S172 of the Companies Act 2006 to act in a way that promotes the company’s success for the benefit of the members as a whole, and to have regard to the long-term effects of decisions on the company and stakeholders, The following statement outlines the way in which these responsibilities are handled:
The company is privately held and provides employment, training and financial reward to the owners and employees, including profit sharing arrangements.
Strategic decisions are based on medium and long-term objectives. In particular, the policy of continued investment in latest state of the art production technologies ensures high quality and efficiency of output and provides an ongoing competitive edge in the market.
Key stakeholders, and the ways in which we engage with them, are as follows:
Employees
We rely on a skilled and highly motivated workforce and recruitment & retention of staff is critical to the business. We help engagement with our team by:
Appropriate remuneration and rewarding outstanding performance through profit sharing arrangements;
Providing industry leading training, coupled with career development opportunities
Customers and suppliers
We invest heavily in the latest technology throughout our business so that we can continue to offer quality products at short lead times.

DIRECTORS' REPORT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023
- 3 -
The directors present their annual report and financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023.
Principal activities
The principal activities of the company are fabrication and forming of metals, laser cutting, powder coating and the manufacture of camera towers.
Results and dividends
The results for the year are set out on page 10.
Ordinary dividends were paid amounting to £4,000,000. The directors do not recommend payment of a final dividend.
Directors
The directors who held office during the year and up to the date of signature of the financial statements were as follows:
J S Hartley
W Tierney
Disabled persons
Applications for employment by disabled persons are always fully considered, bearing in mind the aptitudes of the applicant concerned. In the event of members of staff becoming disabled, every effort is made to ensure that their employment within the company continues and that the appropriate training is arranged. It is the policy of the company that the training, career development and promotion of disabled persons should, as far as possible, be identical to that of other employees.
Employee involvement
It is the policy of the company to ensure that employees are aware of their individual roles and responsibilities and are informed about the trading performance and progress of the group.
Auditor
The auditor, PM+M Solutions for Business LLP, is deemed to be reappointed under section 487(2) of the Companies Act 2006.
Energy and carbon report
During the year, the company within the group consumed 5.3m kWh (2022 - 4.9m kWh) of energy.
The volume of CO2 equivalent produced through direct emissions by gas combustion was 480 tonnes (2022 - 447 tonnes) and fuel consumed by own transport was 225 tonnes (2022 - 256 tonnes).
The volume of CO2 equivalent produced through indirect emissions by the purchase of electricity was 544 tonnes (2022 - 471 tonnes) and fuel consumed for transport not owned by the company was 13 tonnes (2022 - 9 tonnes).
WEC GROUP LIMITED
DIRECTORS' REPORT (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023
- 4 -
Energy consumption is measured through extensive metering systems in all locations and captured in real time. Emissions in tonnes of CO2 are calculated using industry standard conversion factors applied to the real time consumption data.
The company uses an intensity ratio of tonnes of CO2e per employee. During the period this ratio was 3.92 tonnes per employee (2022 - 3.85).
Energy efficiency improvement initiatives are important to the company. We have actively invested in the latest production equipment and technologies, which significantly cuts like for like consumption, and are currently looking for opportunities generally in production and non-production environments, including installation of LED lighting in a number of areas.
The company is focused on energy and cost reduction throughout, and ultimately on cutting emissions by default. A relatively volatile product mix in operations makes meaningful ratio analysis difficult in the current climate but we will consider opportunities to develop statistics going forward which will meaningfully demonstrate our progress in relation to these goals.
Statement of directors' responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of the profit or loss of the company for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements;
prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Statement of disclosure to auditor
So far as each person who was a director at the date of approving this report is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the company’s
auditor
is unaware. Additionally, the directors individually have taken all the necessary steps that they ought to have taken as directors in order to make themselves aware of all relevant audit information and to establish that the company’s
auditor
is aware of that information.
Disclosure
The ultimate shareholder has requested that the directors include the following statement
- the ultimate parent company is privately held, as is the company, and they believe the requirement to publish
private accounts is a violation of both the spirit and law under
UK
right to privacy legislation.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT
TO THE MEMBER OF WEC GROUP LIMITED
- 6 -
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of WEC Group Limited (the 'company') for the year ended 31 December 2023 which comprise the statement of comprehensive income, the balance sheet, the statement of changes in equity and notes to the financial statements, including significant accounting policies.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 102
The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
In our opinion the financial statements:
give a true and fair view of the state of the company's affairs as at 31 December 2023 and of its profit for the year then ended;
have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the
Auditor's
responsibilities for the audit of the
financial statements
section of our report. We are independent of the
company
in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the
financial statements
in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard
, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Conclusions relating to going concern
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.
Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.
Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report.
Other information
The other information comprises the information included in the annual report other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of our audit
:
the information given in the strategic report and the directors'
r
eport for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements
; and
the strategic report and the directors' report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
WEC GROUP LIMITED
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT (CONTINUED)
TO THE MEMBER OF WEC GROUP LIMITED
- 7 -
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identifie
d
material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors'
r
eport
.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
certain disclosures of
remuneration specified by law are not made; or
we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the directors'
r
esponsibilities
s
tatement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of
financial statements
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the
financial statements
, the
directors are
responsible for assessing the company
'
s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or have
no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements
as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an
auditor's
report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with
ISAs (UK)
will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these
financial statements
.
Extent to which the audit was considered capable of
detecting irregularities, including fraud
Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below
.
We identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and then design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, including obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT (CONTINUED)
TO THE MEMBER OF WEC GROUP LIMITED

Identifying and assessing potential risks related to
irregularities
In identifying and assessing risks of material misstatement in
respect of irregularities, including fraud and non-compliance with
laws and regulations, we have considered the following
:
the nature of the industry and sector, control environment and
business performance including the design of the
Company'
s
remuneration policies, key drivers for directors’ remuneration,
bonus levels and performance targets;
results of our enquiries of management about their own identification and assessment of
the risks of irregularities;
the matters discussed among the audit engagement team regarding how and where fraud
might occur in the financial statements and any potential
indicators of fraud
;
a
ny matters we identified having obtained and reviewed the
Company's
documentation of their policies and procedures
relating to:
identifying, evaluating and complying with laws and regulations
and whether they were aware of any instances of non
-
compliance;
detecting and responding to the risks of fraud and whether
they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged
fraud;
the internal controls established to mitigate risks of fraud or
non-compliance with laws and regulations
.
As a result of these procedures, we considered the opportunities and incentives that may exist within the organisation for fraud and identified the greatest potential for fraud in the following areas: timing of recognition of commercial income; posting of unusual journals and complex transactions; and manipulating the Company's performance profit measures and other key performance indicators to meet remuneration targets and externally communicated targets. In common with all audits under ISAs (UK), we are also required to perform specific procedures to respond to the risk of management override.
We also obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory
frameworks that the
Company
operates in, focusing on provisions
of those laws and regulations that had a direct effect on the
determination of material amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. The key laws and regulations we considered in this
context included
UK Companies Act, employment law, health and
safety, pensions legislation and tax legislation.
Audit response to risks identified
Our procedures to respond to risks identified included the following:
reviewing the financial statement disclosures and testing to supporting documentation to assess compliance with provisions of relevant laws and regulations described as having a direct effect on the financial statements;
enquiring of management concerning actual and potential litigation and claims;
performing analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships that may indicate risks of material misstatement due to fraud;
reading minutes of meetings of those charged with governance and reviewing correspondence with HMRC; and
in addressing the identified risks of fraud through management override of controls, testing the appropriateness of journal entries and other adjustments; assessing whether the judgements made in making accounting estimates are indicative of a potential bias; and evaluating the business rationale of any significant transactions that are unusual or outside the normal course of business.
Owing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk
that we may not have detected some material misstatements in the
financial statements, even though we have properly planned and
performed our audit in accordance with auditing standards. For example,
the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations
(irregularities) is
from the events and transactions reflected in the financial
statements, the less likely the inherently limited procedures required by
auditing standards would identify it. In addition, as with any audit, there
remained a higher risk of non
-
detection of irregularities, as these may
involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the
override of internal controls. We are not responsible for preventing
non-compliance and cannot be expected to detect non-compliance with
all laws and regulations.

private
company
limited by shares
incorporated in
England and Wales
.
The registered office is
Britannia House, Junction Street, Darwen, Lancashire, BB3 2RB.
1.1
Accounting convention
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 102 “The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland” (“FRS 102”) and the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
The financial statements are prepared in

.
T
he company has

:
Compensation for key management personnel
.
The financial statements of the company are consolidated in the financial statements of

Going concern
A
true
t the time of approving the financial statements

Accounting policies
(Continued)
- 14 -
1.4
Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets
are initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost or valuation, net of depreciation and any impairment losses.
Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over their useful lives on the following bases:
Leasehold improvements
over the term of the lease
Plant and machinery
10%-20% straight line
Fixtures, fittings & office equipment
20% straight line
Motor vehicles
25% straight line
The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying value of the asset, and
is credited or charged to profit or loss
.
1.5
Impairment of fixed assets
At each reporting
period
end date, the
company
reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible
assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any).
1.6
Stocks
Stocks are stated at the lower of
either
cost
or
estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell. Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the stocks to their present location and condition.
At each reporting date, an assessment is made for impairment. Any excess of the carrying amount of stocks over its estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell is recognised as an impairment loss in profit or loss. Reversals of impairment losses are also recognised in profit or loss.
1.7
Cash at bank and in hand
Cash and cash equivalents
are basic financial assets
and
include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities.
1.8
Financial instruments
The company has elected to apply the provisions of Section 11 ‘Basic Financial Instruments’ and Section 12 ‘Other Financial Instruments Issues’ of FRS 102 to all of its financial instruments.
Financial instruments are recognised in the company's balance sheet when the company becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Basic financial assets
Basic financial assets, which include
debtors and
cash and bank balances, are measured at transaction price
.
Basic financial liabilities
Basic financial liabilities, including
creditors
, bank loans
and
loans from
fellow group companies are recognised at transaction
price.

in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. A
m
ounts payable are classified as
current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less.

Accounting policies
(Continued)
- 15 -
1.9
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Current tax
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the
profit and loss account
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The
company’s
liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting end date.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all timing differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the timing difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the
profit and loss account
, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the
company
has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority.
1.10
Retirement benefits
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
1.11
Hire purchase and operating leases
A hire purchase arises whenever the terms of the contract
transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the
company
.
Assets held under
hire purchase
are recognised as assets at the lower of the assets fair
value at the date of inception and the present value of the minimum hire purchase payments. The related liability is included in the balance sheet as a hire purchase obligation. Payments are treated as consisting of capital and interest elements. The interest is charged to profit or loss
so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Rentals payable under operating leases, are charged to
profit or loss
on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease except where another more systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the lease
d
asset are consumed.
1.12
Government grants
Government grants are recognised at the fair value of the asset receive
d
or receivable when there is reasonable assurance that the grant conditions will be met and the grants will be received.
1.13
Research
and development
Research expenditure is written off against profits in the year in which it is incurred.

Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the company’s accounting policies, the directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised where the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods where the revision affects both current and future periods.
The
main areas of
judg
e
ment
are in relation to revenue recognition, stock and debtor provisions, and the useful economic lives and residual values of the company's fixed assets
.
