NOTES TO THE ABRIDGED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED 31 JANUARY 2025
1. General information
The company is a private company limited by shares, registered in England and Wales. The address of the registered
office is Lifford Hall, Lifford Lane, Kings Norton, Birmingham, B30 3JN.
2. Statement of compliance
These abridged financial statements have been prepared in compliance with Section 1A of FRS 102, 'The Financial
Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and the Republic of Ireland’.
3. Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The abridged financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, as modified by the revaluation of
certain financial assets and liabilities and investment properties measured at fair value through profit or loss.
The abridged financial statements are prepared in sterling, which is the functional currency of the entity.
Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported. These estimates and judgements are continually reviewed and are based on experience and
other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Revenue recognition
Turnover is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods supplied and services
rendered, net of discounts and Value Added Tax. Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks
and rewards of ownership have transferred to the buyer (usually on despatch of the goods); the amount of revenue can be
measured reliably; it is probable that the associated economic benefits will flow to the entity; and the costs incurred or to
be incurred in respect of the transactions can be measured reliably.
Tangible assets
Tangible assets are initially recorded at cost, and subsequently stated at cost less any accumulated depreciation and
impairment losses. Any tangible assets carried at revalued amounts are recorded at the fair value at the date of
revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses. An increase in
the carrying amount of an asset as a result of a revaluation, is recognised in other comprehensive income and
accumulated in equity, except to the extent it reverses a revaluation decrease of the same asset previously recognised in
profit or loss. A decrease in the carrying amount of an asset as a result of revaluation, is recognised in other
comprehensive income to the extent of any previously recognised revaluation increase accumulated in equity in respect
of that asset. Where a revaluation decrease exceeds the accumulated revaluation gains accumulated in equity in respect of
that asset, the excess shall be recognised in profit or loss.

Depreciation
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost or valuation of an asset, less its residual value, over the useful
economic life of that asset as follows:

Fixtures and fittings - 15% reducing balance

Equipment - 20% reducing balance
Impairment of fixed assets
A review for indicators of impairment is carried out at each reporting date, with the recoverable amount being estimated
where such indicators exist. Where the carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount, the asset is impaired accordingly.
Prior impairments are also reviewed for possible reversal at each reporting date. For the purposes of impairment testing,
when it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, an estimate is made of the recoverable
amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. The cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable group
of assets that includes the asset and generates cash inflows that largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets
or groups of assets. For impairment testing of goodwill, the goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the
acquisition date, allocated to each of the cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the
combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the company are assigned to those units.
Financial instruments
Financial instruments are classified and accounted for, according to the substance of the contractual arrangement, as
either financial assets, financial liabilities or equity instruments. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a
residual interest in the assets of the company after deducting all of its liabilities.

Defined contribution plans

Contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as an expense in the period in which the related service is
provided. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that the prepayment will lead to a reduction in
future payments or a cash refund. When contributions are not expected to be settled wholly within 12 months of the end
of the reporting date in which the employees render the related service, the liability is measured on a discounted present
value basis. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as a finance cost in profit or loss in the period in which it arises.
4. Employee numbers

The average number of persons employed by the company during the year amounted to 5 (2024: 5 ).
