1 General information

Its registered number is: 11553273

Its registered office is:

Unit 8 Moniton Trading Estat

Hampshire

RG22 6NQ

The accounts have been prepared in accordance with FRS 102 Section 1A - The Financial Reporting
Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland and the Companies Act 2006.

2 Accounting policies

Turnover
Turnover is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, Turnover is reduced for
estimated customer returns, rebates and other similar allowances.

Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when all the following conditions are satisfied:

* the Company has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the
goods;

© the Company retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated
with ownership nor effective control over the goods sold;

* the amount of revenue can be measured reliably;

¢ it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Company;
and

« the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.

Specifically, revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when goods are delivered and legal title is
passed.

Tangible fixed assets and depreciation

Tangible fixed assets held for the company's own use are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and
accumulated impairment losses.

At each balance sheet date, the company reviews the carrying amount of its tangible fixed assets to
determine whether there is any indication that any items have suffered an impairment loss. If any such
indication exists, the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the
impairment loss.
Depreciation is provided at the following annual rates in order to write off the cost or valuation less the
estimated residual value of each asset over its estimated useful life:

Plant and machinery 25% Reducing balance

Motor vehicles 25% Reducing balance

Taxation
Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.

The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit as
reported in the profit and loss account because of items of income or expense that are taxable or
deductible in other years and items that are never taxable or deductible. The Company's liability for
current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the
reporting period.

Deferred tax is recognised on timing differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in
the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets
are generally recognised for all deductible timing differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable
profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilised. The carrying
amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent
that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset
to be recovered.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in
which the liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted
or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.

Current or deferred tax for the year is recognised in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that
are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and
deferred tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.

Trade and other debtors

Trade and other debtors are initially recognised at fair value and thereafter stated at amortised cost using
the effective interest method, less impairment losses for bad and doubtful debts.

Trade and other creditors

Short term creditors are measured at the transaction price. Other financial liabilities, including bank loans,
are measured initially at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are measured subsequently at amortised
cost using the effective interest method.

Leased assets

Where the company enters into a lease which entails taking substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership of an asset, the lease is treated as a finance lease.

Leases which do not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Company are
classified as operating leases.

Assets held under finance leases are initially recognised as assets of the Company at their fair value at the
inception of the lease or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. The corresponding
liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet date as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are
apportioned between finance expenses and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant
rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance expenses are recognised immediately in
profit or loss, unless they are directly attributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalised in
accordance with the Company's policy on borrowing costs (see the accounting policy above).

Assets held under finance leases are depreciated in the same way as owned assets.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

In the event that lease incentives are received to enter into operating leases, such incentives are
recognised as a liability. The aggregate benefit of incentives is recognised as a reduction of rental expense
on a straight-line basis.

Defined contribution pensions

The Company operates a defined contribution plan for its employees. A defined contribution plan is a
pension plan under which the company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. Once the
contributions have been paid the company has no further payments obligations.

The contributions are recognised as expenses when they fall due. Amounts not paid are shown in accruals
in the balance sheet. The assets of the plan are held separately from the company in independently
administered funds.

Provisions

Provisions are made where an event has taken place that gives the Company a legal or constructive
obligation that probably requires settlement by a transfer of economic benefit, and a reliable estimate can
be made of the amount of the obligation.

Provisions are charged as an expense to the profit and loss account in the year that the Company becomes
aware of the obligation, and are measured at the best estimate at balance sheet date of the expenditure
required to settle the obligation, taking into account relevant risks and uncertainties.

When payments are eventually made, they are charged to the provision carried in the balance sheet.
