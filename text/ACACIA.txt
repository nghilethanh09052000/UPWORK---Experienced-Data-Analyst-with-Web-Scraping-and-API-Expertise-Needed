STRATEGIC REPORT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023
- 1 -
The directors present the strategic report for the year ended 31 December 2023.
Review of the business
The 2023 financial year showed a decline in sales by £2,336,742 to total £6,238,021 during the year (2022: £8,574,773). This is a reduction of 27.25% on the previous year. Sales returned to a similar level of which were achieved ion 2021. The level of Cost of Sales also saw a reduction of 27.89% compared to 2022. The reduction in cost of sales was consistent with the reduction in turnover. Therefore the gross profit margin remained very similar with a margin of 37.02% in 2023 compared to 36.47% in 2022.
Cash level reduced during the year with £157,357 in 2023 compared to £232,608 in 2022. This in part has seen the debtors increase to £6,067,623 compared to £4,786,728 in 2022, an increase of 26.76%.
The directors believe that the company will be beneficial from involvement in the group with economies of scales being achieved throughout the group.
Principal risks and uncertainties
No new risks have been identified during the financial year. Staff & direct costs continue to be the main risks and uncertainties within the company due to fluctuating prices. Gross profit margins have remained at similar levels which shows that the risks have been dealt with successfully.
With support from other members of the group, we are confident that any challenges presented to maintain profitability levels will be achieved.
Key performance indicators
The group measure performance consistently by reviewing turnover, gross profit margins and operating profits

DIRECTORS' RESPONSIBILITIES STATEMENT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023
- 3 -
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year.
Under that law the directors have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law).
Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of the profit or loss of the company for that period.
In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT
TO THE MEMBER OF ACACIA TRAINING LIMITED
- 4 -
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Acacia Training Limited
(the 'company')
for the year ended 31 December 2023 which comprise the statement of comprehensive income, the statement of financial position, the statement of changes in equity, the statement of cash flows and
notes to the financial statements, including significant accounting policies
. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
In our opinion the financial statements:
give a true and fair view of the state of the company's affairs as at 31 December 2023 and of its profit for the year then ended;
have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the
Auditor's
responsibilities for the audit of the
financial statements
section of our report. We are independent of the
company
in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the
financial statements
in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard
, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Conclusions relating to going concern
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.
Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.
Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report.
Other information
The other information comprises the information included in the annual report other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of our audit
:
the information given in the directors'
r
eport for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements
; and
the directors' report has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
ACACIA TRAINING LIMITED
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT (CONTINUED)
TO THE MEMBER OF ACACIA TRAINING LIMITED

Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identifie
d
material misstatements in the directors'
r
eport
.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
certain disclosures of
remuneration specified by law are not made; or
we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the directors'
r
esponsibilities
s
tatement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of
financial statements
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the
financial statements
, the
directors are
responsible for assessing the company
'
s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or have
no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements
as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an
auditor's
report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with
ISAs (UK)
will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these
financial statements
.
Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below
.
From the preliminary of the audit, we ensure our understanding of the entity is up to date. This includes, but is not limited to, current knowledge of their activities, the business and control environments, and their compliance with the applicable legal and regulatory frameworks. This information supports our risk identification and the subsequent design of audit procedures to mitigate those risks; ensuring that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to support our opinion.
In response to the risks identified, specific to this entity, we designed procedures which included, but were not limited to:
Enquiry of management and those charged with governance around actual and potential litigation and claims;
Reviewing minutes of meetings of those charged with governance, if available;
Reviewing financial statement disclosures and testing to supporting documentation to assess compliance with applicable laws and regulations;
Auditing the risk of management override of controls, including through testing journal entries and other adjustments for appropriateness, and evaluating the business rationale for significant transactions outside the normal course of business.
A further description of our responsibilities is available on the
Financial Reporting Council's website at: https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.
This description forms part of our
auditor's
report.

Accounting policies
Company information
Acacia Training Limited is a private company limited by shares incorporated in England and Wales. The registered office is Acacia House Trentham Business Quarter, Bellringer Road Trentham, Stoke-On-Trent, Staffordshire, ST4 8GB.
The company's principal activities and nature of its operations are disclosed in the directors' report.
1.1
Accounting convention
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (FRS 101) and in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
The financial statements are prepared in sterling, which is the functional currency of the company. Monetary amounts in these financial statements are rounded to the nearest £.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
1.2
Going concern
The directors have at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the
true
company
has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus
t
he directors continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.
1.3
Revenue
Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer and excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The company recognises revenue when it transfers control of a product or service to a customer.
When cash inflows are deferred and represent a financing arrangement, the fair value of the consideration is the present value of the future receipts. The difference between the fair value of the consideration and the nominal amount received is recognised as interest income.
The company recognises revenue from the following major sources:
Delivery of vocational training
The nature, timing of satisfaction of performance obligations and significant payment terms of the company's major sources of revenue are as follows:
Delivery of vocational training
Revenue from contracts for the provision of professional services is recognised by reference to the stage of completion when the stage of completion, costs incurred and costs to complete can be estimated reliably. The stage of completion is calculated by comparing costs incurred, mainly in relation to contractual hourly staff rates and materials, as a proportion of total costs.
Where the outcome cannot be estimated reliably, revenue is recognised only to the extent of the expenses recognised that are recoverable.

Accounting policies
(Continued)
- 12 -
1.4
Intangible assets other than goodwill
Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are recognised at cost and are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Intangible assets acquired on business combinations are recognised separately from goodwill at the acquisition date where it is probable that the expected future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the entity and the
fair
value of the asset can be measured reliably; the intangible asset arises from contractual or other legal rights; and the intangible asset is separable from the entity.
Amortisation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over their useful lives on the following bases:
Patents
Development costs internally generated
Such assets are defined as having finite useful lives and the costs are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives of 5 years
Intangible assets are stated at cost less amortisation and are reviewed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the carrying value may be impaired.
1.5
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost or valuation, net of depreciation and any impairment losses.
Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over their useful lives on the following bases:
Leasehold land and buildings
Over the life of the lease
Computers
10% - 33% straight line and over the life of the lease
Motor vehicles
10% - 33% straight line and over the life of the lease
The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying value of the asset, and is recognised in the
income statement
.
1.6
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets
At each reporting end date, the
company
reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the
company
estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment annually, and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
ACACIA TRAINING LIMITED
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

Accounting policies
(Continued)
- 13 -
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit)
in
prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
1.7
Inventories
Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost and
estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell. Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the
inventories
to their present location and condition.
Inventories
held for distribution at no or nominal consideration are measured
at
the lower of cost and replacement cost,
adjusted where applicable for any loss of service potential.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
1.8
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less
.
1.9
Financial assets
Financial assets are recognised in the company's statement of financial position when the company becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets are classified into specified categories, depending on the nature and purpose of the financial assets.
Financial assets held at amortised cost
Financial instruments are classified as financial assets measured at amortised cost where the objective is to hold these assets in order to collect contractual cash flows, and the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest. They arise principally from the provision of goods and services to customers (eg trade receivables). They are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs directly attributable to their acquisition or issue, and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less provision for impairment where necessary.
1.10
Financial liabilities
The company recogni
s
es financial debt when the company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instruments. Financial liabilities are classified as either
'
financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
'
or
'
other financial liabilities
'
.

- 14 -
Other financial liabilities
Other financial liabilities, including borrowings
, t
rade payables and other short-term monetary liabilities, are initially measured at fair value net of transaction costs
directly attributable to the issuance of the financial liability. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method
.
For the purposes of each financial liability, interest expense includes initial transaction costs and any premium payable on redemption, as well as any interest or coupon payable while the liability is outstanding.
Derecognition of financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are derecognised when, and only when, the
company’s
obligations are discharged, cancelled, or they expire.
1.11
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Dividends payable on equity instruments are recognised as liabilities once they are no longer at the discretion of the company.
1.12
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Current tax
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the
income statement
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The
company’s
liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting end date.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting end date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the
income statement
, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the
company
has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority.
1.13
Employee benefits
The costs of short-term employee benefits are recognised as a liability and an expense, unless those costs are required to be recognised as part of the cost of
inventories

1.14
Retirement benefits
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
1.15
Leases
At inception, the company assesses whether a contract is
,
or contains
,
a lease
within the scope of IFRS 16. A contract is
,
or contains
,
a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.
Where a tangible asset is acquired through a lease, the company recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. Right-of-use assets are included within
property, plant and equipment,
apart from those that meet the definition of investment property
.
The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date plus any initial direct costs and an estimate of the cost of obligations to dismantle, remove, refurbish or restore the underlying asset and the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received.
The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term. The estimated useful lives of right-of-use assets are determined on the same basis as those of other property, plant and equipment. The right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.
The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are unpaid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the company's incremental borrowing rate. Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise fixed payments, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, and the cost of any options that the company is reasonably certain to exercise, such as the exercise price under a purchase option, lease payments in an optional renewal period, or penalties for early termination of a lease.
The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a change in
:
future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate; the company's estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; or the company's assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option.
When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.
The company has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases of machinery that have a lease term of 12 months or less, or for leases of low-value assets including IT equipment. The payments associated with these leases are recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
