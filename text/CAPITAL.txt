Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland" including the provisions of Section 1A "Small Entities" and the Companies
Act 2006,

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of preparing the financial statements
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.

Turnover
Turnover is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for services
rendered, stated net of discounts and Value Added Tax.

The company recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be measured reliably and when it is probable that future
economic benefits will flow to the entity.

Intangible assets

Intangible assets are initially measured at cost. After initial recognition, intangible assets are measured at cost less any
accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment Josses.

Development costs are being amortised evenly over their estimated uscful life of nil years.

Financial instruments

The company only enters into basic financial instrument transactions that result in the recognition of financial assets and
liabilities like trade and other accounts receivable and payable, loans from banks and other third parties, loans to related parties
and investments on non-puttable ordinary shares.

Financial assets that are measured at cost and amortised cost are assessed at the end of each reporting period for objective
evidence of impairment. If objective evidence of impairment is found, an impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss.

Taxation
A current tax liability is recognised for the tax payable on the taxable profit of the current and past periods. A current tax asset is
recognised in respect of a tax loss that can be carried back to recover tax paid in a previous period,

Deferred tax |s recognised in respect of all timing differences between the recognition of income and expenses in the financial
statements and their inclusion in tax assessments.

Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that they will be
recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities and other future taxable profits.

Deferred tax is measured using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date
and that are expected to apply to the reversal of the timing difference.

Current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Research and development
Expenditure on research and development Is written off in the year in which it is incurred.

Employee benefits

Short-term employee benefits including contributions into define contribution pension schemes are recognised as an expense in
the period in which they are incurred.
