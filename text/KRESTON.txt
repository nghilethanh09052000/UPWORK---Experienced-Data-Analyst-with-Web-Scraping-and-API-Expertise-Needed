Business review

Our vision: To have a positive impact and lead the way as a socially focused adviser, known for our personal,
proactive and passionate approach, creating growth opportunities in London, the South East and beyond.

- Turnover for the year was £49.4m, 11% higher than the prior year. Opportunities for revenue growth remained
strong in many of our markets, both through winning of new business and the successful management of pricing.

Client care and increasing client value is fundamental to our success and our people's passion for our clients
has not only seen an increase in our Net Promoter Score in 2023 but also continued recognition at the
prestigious Accounting Excellence Awards. :

_ The competition for talent continued to be challenging and in order to best exploit the market opportunities, we
invested significantly in our people with a £2.7m increase in staff costs. Our apprenticeship programme —
continues to go from strength to strength with fecord numbers of apprentices joining us in 2023, a record we will
exceed again in 2024.

During the year we continued our ambitious investment programme with notable spending increases of 16%.on
software, 18% on property costs, 18% on staff training and 38% on offshoring capabilities. Overall, Other
external charges, depreciation and amortisation increased 6% during the year, with the Strategic investment
spend being offset by savings elsewhere. -

We would like to take this opportunity to thank all our partners and staff in delivering these excellent results,
which reflect the dedication they have for our clients, our teams and our communities.

Members’ responsibilities statement
‘For the year ended 31 May 2024

The members are responsible for preparing the annual report and the consolidated financial statements in
accordance with applicable law and regulations. -

Company law, (as applied by The Limited Liability Partnerships (Accounts and Audit) (Application of Companies
Act 2006) Regulations 2008), requires the members to prepare financial statements for each financial year.
Under that law the members have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with applicable law
‘and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice), including
Financial Reporting Standard .102 ‘The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of
Ireland’. Under company law, as applied to LLPs, the members must not approve the financial statements unless
they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the LLP and the Group and of the
profit or loss of the Group for that period. .

In preparing these fi nancial statements, the members are required to:

° select suitable accounting policies for the Group's financial statements and then apply them consistently;

e . make judgments and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;

. state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures
disclosed and explained in the financial ‘statements;

¢ prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the

Group will continue in business.

The members are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain
the LLP's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the LLP and
the Group and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Limited Liability
Partnerships (Accounts and Audit) (Application of the Companies Act 2006) Regulations 2008. They are also
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the LLP and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the:
prevention and.detection of. fraud and other irregularities.

The members are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the LLP and financial information included on

the Group's website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial
Statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. .

Independent auditors’ report to the members of Kreston Reeves LLP

Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of Kreston Reeves LLP (the ‘parent LLP’) and its subsidiaries (the
‘Group’) for the year ended 31 May 2024, which comprise the Consolidated profit and loss account, the .
Consolidated balance sheet, the LLP balance sheet, the Consolidated statement of cash flows, the Consolidated
. Reconciliation of members' interests, the LLP Reconciliation of members’ interests and the related notes,
including a summary of significant accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that has been applied
in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including Financial Reporting
Standard 102 ‘The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland’ (United Kingdom
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

In our‘opinion the financial statements:

° give a true and fair view of the state of the Group's and of the parent LLP's affairs a as at 31 May 2024 and

; of the Group’ 's result for the year then ended; .. .

e have been properly prepared i in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice; and

° have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, as applied to limited

’ liability partnerships by The Limited Liability Partnerships (Accounts and Audit) (Application | of Companies
Act 2006) Regulations 2008.

Basis for opinion ,

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable
law: Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit’
of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical
requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the United Kingdom, including the.
Financial Reporting Council's Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in
accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and
‘appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Conclusions relating to going concern

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the members' use of the going concern basis of
: “accounting in the preparation of the’ financial statements is appropriate.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or
conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group's or the parent LLP's ability to” —
continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are
‘authorised for issue.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the members with respect to going concern are described in the
relevant sections of this report.

Other information

The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report other than the financial
statements and our Auditors’ report thereon. The members are responsible for the other information contained
within the Annual Report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we

do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. Our responsibility is to read the other information and, .
in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our
knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify
such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this
gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have
performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report
that fact. . (

We have nothing to report in this regard.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception

We have nothing to report i in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006, as
applied to limited liability partnerships, requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:

_ adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent LLP, or returns adequate for our audit
, have not been received from branches not visited by us; or

ie the parent LLP financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting. records and returns; or

. we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

. Responsibilities of members ,

As.explained more fully in the Members' responsibilities statement on page 3, the members are responsible for
the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such
internal control as the members determine is necessary to enable the Preparation ¢ of financial statements that, are
tree from material r misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the members a are responsible for assessing the Group's and the parent
LLP's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and
using the going concern basis of accounting unless the members either intend to liquidate tr the Group or the |
parent L| LLP or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. -

Page 5

Kreston Reeves LLP

Independent auditors’ report to the members of Kreston Reeves LLP (continued)

Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements —

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an Auditors’ report that includes our
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not'a guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise
from fraud or error and are considered: material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be
expected to influence the economic decisions of users-taken on the basis of these Group financial statements.

" Irregularitiés, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures .
in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities,
including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is
detailed below: .

We undertake the following procedures to identify, and respond to these risks of non- compliance:

‘- Understanding the key legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the LLP. We communicated
identified laws and regulations throughout the audit team and remained alert to any indications of non-_
compliance throughout the audit. We determined the most significant of these to be the regulations and codes
_ of conduct issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales.
- Enquiry of members and management as to policies and procedures to. ensure compliance and any k known
instances of non-compliance
- Review of board minutes and correspondence with regulators
- Enquiry of members and management as to areas of the financial statements 5 susceptible to fraud and how
these risks are managed
- Challenging management on key estimates, assumptions and judgements made in the preparation of the
financial statements. These key areas of uncertainty are disclosed in the accounting policies
- Identifying and testing unusual journal entries, with a particular focus on manual journal entries.

Through these procedures, we did not become aware of actual or suspected non-compliance.

We planned and performed our audit in accordance with auditing standards but owing to the inherent limitations '
of procedures required in these areas, there is an unavoidable risk that we may not have detected a material ~
misstatement in the accounts. The further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is from the events
and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely we would become aware of it. The risk of ©
not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from
error, as fraud may involve concealment, collusion, forgery, misrepresentations, or override of internal controls.
We are not responsible for preventing non-compliance and cannot be expected to detect non-compliance with all
laws and regulations. .

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial
Reporting Council's website at: www. frc.org. uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our
Auditors’ report.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs (UK), we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional

scepticism throughout the audit: We also:

. Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or

_ error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence thatis _
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve
collusion, forgery, intentional. omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

. ‘Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion of the effectiveness
of the Group's internal control.

. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates and related disclosures made by the members.

Page 6

Kreston Reeves LLP

Independent auditors’ report to the members of Kreston Reeves LLP (continued)

e Conclude on the appropriateness of the members’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and,
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions
that may cast significant doubt on the Group or the parent LLP's ability to continue as a going concern. If
we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our Auditors’ ‘report to
the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our
opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our Auditors’ report.
However, future events or conditions may cause the Group's and the parent LLP to cease to continue as a.
going concern.

e Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the
disclosures, ahd whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in
manner that achieves fair presentation. .

° Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the fi nancial information of the entities or business
activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are
responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely

- responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and
timing of the audit and signifi icant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we
identify during our audit.

Use of our report

This report is made solely to the LLP's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the
Companies Act 2006, as applied by Part 12 of The Limited Liability Partnerships (Accounts and Audit)

- (Application of Companies Act 2006) Regulations 2008. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might
state to the LLP’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an Auditors’ report and for no other
purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than
the LLP and the LLP's members, as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have
formed.

Notes to the financial statements
For the year ended 31 May 2024

| 4.” General information

Kreston. Reeves LLP is a limited liability partnership incorporated in England & Wales. ‘The registered -
office is 37 St Margaret's Street, Canterbury, Kent, CT1 2TU, with six other offices located in London and
the South East of England. The principal activities are the provision of a full range of professional advisory
services.

2. ‘Accounting policies

2.1

22

Basis of preparation of financial statements /

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention unless otherwise
specified within these accounting policies and in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102,
the Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and the Republic of Ireland and the
Companies Act 2006 and the requirements of the Statement of Recommended Practice "Accounting
by Limited Liability Partnerships”:

The Group and LLP's functional and presentation currency is pounds etoring. ’ The financial
statements are presented to the nearest £1,000. -

The preparation of fi nancial statements. in compliance with FRS 102 requires the use of certain
critical accounting estimates. It also requires Group management to exercise judgment in applying |
the Group's accounting policies (see note 3).

The LLP has taken advantage ‘of the exemption allowed under section 408 of the Companies Act
2006 and has not presented its own Profit and loss account in these financial statements.

The following principal accounting policies have been applied: ; an
Financial Reporting Standard 102 - reduced disclosure exemptions.

The LLP has taken advantage of the following disclosure exemption in preparing its individual
financial statements, as permitted by FRS 102: :

. + the requirement to present a statement of cash flows for the LLP.

2. Accounting policies (continued)

2.3

Basis of consolidation /

The consolidated financial statements present the results of the LLP and its own subsidiaries ("the

‘Group"). as if they form a single entity. Intercompany transactions and balances between group

companies are therefore eliminated in full. .

The consolidated financial statemerits incorporate the ‘results of business combinations using the
purchase method. In the Balance sheet, the acquiree's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent
liabilities are initially recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date. The results of acquired

- operations are included in the Consolidated profit and loss account from the date on which control is

2.4

obtained. They are deconsolidated from the date control ceases.

A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. Control is the power to govern the financial and
operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. Where the Group owns less
than 50% of the voting powers of an entity but controls the entity by virtue of an agreement with other
investors which give it control of the financial and operating policies of the entity, it accounts for that
entity as a subsidiary. :

‘The results and assets and liabilities of joint venture undertakings (joint ventures’) are incorporated in .

the consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity
method, investments in joint ventures are carried in the consolidated balance sheet at cost as
adjusted for post- acquisition changes in the group's share of the net assets of the joint venture, less
any impairment in the value of the investment. Losses of a joint venture in excess of the group's.
interest in that joint venture are not recognised. Additional losses are provided for, and a liability is
recognised, only to the extent that the group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made
payments on behalf of the joint venture.

Revenue

Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the .
Group and the revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is measured as the fair value of the
consideration received or receivable, including services provided to clients which at the reporting date
have not been billed, and excluding value added tax. The following criteria must also be met before
revenue is recognised: . :

Rendering of services

Revenue from a contract to provide services is recognised in the period in which the services are

provided in accordance with the stage of completion. of the contract when all of the following
conditions are satisfied:

. the amount of revenue can be measured reliably;
e it is probable that the Group will receive the Consideration due under the contract;
 e the stage of completion of the contract at the end of the reporting period can be measured
. reliably; and.
. the costs-incurred and the costs to complete the-contract can be measured reliably. >

Operating leases: the Group as lessee

Rentals paid under operating | leases are charged to profi it or loss ona straight- -line basis over the
lease term.”

Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to sign an operating lease are recognised ona
straight-line basis over the lease term, unless another systematic basis is representative of the time
pattern of the lessee's benefit from the use of the leased asset.

Government grants

Grants are accounted under the accruals model as permitted by FRS. 102. Grants of a revenue
nature are recognised in the Consolidated profit and loss account in the same period as the related
expenditure.

\

Interest income

‘Interest income is recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method.

Finance costs

Finance costs are charged to profit or loss over the term of the debt using the effective interest
method so that the amount charged is at a constant rate on the carrying amount. Issue costs are
initially recognised as a reduction in the proceeds of the associated capital instrument.

Borrowing costs

All borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the year in which they are incurred.

2.10 Pensions

Defined contribution pension plan —

The Group operates a defined contribution plan for its employees. A defined contribution plan is: a
pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. Once the

* contributions have been paid the Group has no further payment obligations.

The contributions are recognised as an expense in: profit or loss when they fall due. Amounts not paid
are shown in accruals as a liability in the Balance sheet. The assets of the plan are held separately

. from the Group in independently administered funds.

“2, 11 Taxation

. Taxation on all profits of the LLP is solely the liability 6f the members. Consequently neither taxation
“nor related deferred taxation arising in respect of the LLP are accounted for.in these financial ~

statéments.

2. Accounting policies (continued)

2.12 Intangible assets, including goodwill .

The LLP and the Group have recognised client relationships acquired on business combinations as

‘an intangible asset. Client’ relationships are initially recognised at their fair value. . After initial
recognition, under the cost model, client relationships are measured at cost less accumulated
amortisation and any impairment losses. Client relationships are amortised on a straight line basis
over their estimated useful lives, which have been determined to be between 10 and 20 years.

_ Goodwill represents the difference between the fair value of the consideration payable on the
acquisition of a business and the fair value of its identifiable assets and liabilities at the date of
acquisition. As with client relationships, following initial recognition goodwill is measured at cost less
accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses. Goodwill is amortised on a straight line basis
over its estimated useful life, which has been determined to be between 10 and 20 years.

. At each reporting date.the LLP assesses whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such

indication exists the recoverable amount of intangible assets, including goodwill, is determined which — ,

’ is the higher of their net realisable value and their value in use. An impairment loss is recognised
where the carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount.

2.13 Division and distribution of profits

A division of profits is the mechanism by which the profits of a Group become a debt due to
members. A division. may be automatic or discretionary, may relate to some or all of the profits for a
financial period and may take place during or after the end of a financial period.

An automatic division of profits is one where the Group does not have an unconditional right to avoid

making a division of an amount of profits based on the members' agreement in force at the time,

whereas a discretionary division of profits requires a decision to be. made by the Group, which it has
. the unconditional right to avoid making.

The Group divides profits automatically. Automatic divisions of profits are recognised as ‘Members’
remuneration charged as an expense in the consolidated profit and loss account.

The Group classifies distributions of profits as financing cash flows in the Statement of cash flows as
they are not always directly related to the level of activity in the year under review and may also relate
fo returns on investment.

2. 14 Tangible fixed assets. :
: Tangible fixed assets under the cost model are stated at historical cost less accumulated ~
depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Historical cost includes expenditure that-is

directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of
operating in the manner intended by management.

Notes to the financial statements

2. Accounting policies (continued)

2.14 Tangible fixed assets (continued) :

Depreciation is charged s0 as to allocate the cost of assets less their residual value over their
’ estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method. .

Depreciation is provided on the following basis:

Freehold land . : - nil

Freehold buildings - 25 years straight line. 4
Improvements to property - lower of lease term or 15 years straight line
Fixtures & fittings ~ - 10 years straight line

Computer equipment - 3-15 years Straight line i”

The assets’ residual values, useful ‘ives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted
prospectively if appropriate, or if there i is an indication of a significant change since the last reporting
date. .

’ Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount
and are recognised in profit or loss.

The designated members consider that the residual value of property is such that any provision for
depreciation would not be material, ‘and accordingly no depreciation has been n recognised in respect
of freehold property.

2.15 Valuation of investments
Investments in ‘Subsidiaries are measured at cost less accumulated impairment.
2.16 Associates and joint ventures

’ An entity is treated asa a joint venture where the Group is a party to a contractual agreement with one
or more parties ‘from outside ‘the Group to undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint
control. .

An entity is treated as an associated undertaking where the Group exercises significant influence in
that it has the power to Participate | in the operating and financial policy decisions. .

_In the consolidated accounts, interests in associated undertakings are accounted for using the: equity
method of accounting. Under this method an equity investment is initially recognised at the
transaction price (including transaction costs) and is subsequently adjusted to reflect the investors
share of the profit or loss, other comprehensive income and equity of the associate. The
Consolidated profit and loss account includes the Group's share of the operating results, interest,
pre-tax results and attributable taxation of such undertakings applying accounting policies consistent —
with those of the Group. In the Consolidated balance sheet, the interests in associated undertakings
are shown as the Group's share of the identifiable ‘net assets, including any unamortised premium
paid on acquisition.

- Any premium on acquisition is dealt with in accordance with the goodwill policy.
2.17 Stocks
Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value, after making allowance for slow

moving and obsolete items. Cost includes all direct costs and an appropriate proportion of
overheads.

; 2. 20 Creditors

Accounting policies (continued)
2.18 Debtors

Short-term debtors are measured at transaction price, less any impairment. Loans receivable are
measured initially at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are measured subsequently at amartised
cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment: : .

2.19 Cash and cash equivalents

Cash is represented by cash in hand and deposits with financial institutions repayable without penalty
on notice of not more than 24 hours. Cash equivalents.are highly liquid investments that mature in no
more than three. months from the date of acquisition and that are readily convertible to known
amounts of cash with insignificant risk of change in value.

In the Consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents are shown net of bank
overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group's cash management.
‘

Short- term creditors are measured at the transaction price. Other financial liabilities, including bank
loans, are measured initially at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are measured subsequently ¢ at
amortised cost using the effective interest method.

2. 21 Holiday pay accrual
A liability is recognised to the extent of any unused holiday pay entitlement Which is accrued at the .
balance sheet date and carried forward to future periods. This is measured at the undiscounted
- salary cost of the future holiday entitlement so accrued at the balance sheet date.

2.22 Provisions for liabilities

Provisions are recognised when an event has taken place that gives rise to.a legal or constructive
obligation, a transfer of economic benefits is probable and a reliable estimate can be made.

Provisions are measured as the best estimate of the amount required to settle the obligation, taking
into account the related risks and uncertainties.

Increases i in provisions are generally charged as an expense to profit.or loss.

2.23 Financial instruments mS ,

The Group has elected to apply the provisions of Section 11 “Basic Financial Instruments” of FRS
. 102 to all of its financial instruments.

Financial instruments are recognised in the Group's Balance sheet when the Group becomes party to.-
the contractual provisions of the instrument.

Basic financial assets

Basic financial assets, which include trade and other receivables, cash and bank balances, are

initially measured at their transaction price including transaction costs and are subsequently carried

at their amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any provision for impairment, unless

the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where the transaction is measured at the
«+ present value of the future receipts discounted at a market rate of interest. | .

Discounting is omitted where the effect of discounting is immaterial. The Group's cash and cash. .
-equivalents, trade and most other receivables due with the operating ‘cycle fall into this category of
financial instruments. .

Finanéial liabilities

Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual
arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in
the assets of the Group after the deduction of all its liabilities.

Basic financial liabilities, which include trade and other payables, bank loans, other loans and loans

due to fellow group companies are initially measured at their transaction price after transaction costs.
When this constitutes a financing transaction, whereby the debt instrument is measured at the
present value of the future receipts discounted at a market rate of interest. Discounting is omitted
where the effect of discounting is immaterial. .

Debt instruments: are subsequently carried at their amortised cost using the effective’ interest rate
.method.

Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods and services that have been acquired in the ordinary
course of business from suppliers. Trade payables are classified as current liabilities if the payment is
due within one year. If not, they represent non-current liabilities. Trade payables are initially”
recognised at their transaction price and subsequently are measured at amortised cost using the
effective interest method. Discounting is omitted where the effect of discounting is immaterial.

Judgments in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty

The preparation of the financial statements requires the designated members to make judgments,
estimates and assumptions that can affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities, and the results _
for the year. The nature of estimation is such though that actual outcomes could differ significantly from
those estimates. The following judgments have had the most significant impact on amounts recognised in
the financial statements: :

Lease commitments

The Group has entered into a range of lease commitments in respect of property, plant and equipment.
The classification of these leases as either financial or operating leases requires the designated members
to consider-whether the terms and conditions-of each lease are such that the Group has acquired the risks
and rewards associated. with the ownership of the underlying assets.

The following : are the Group’ s “key sources of estimation uncertainty:

Revenue on service contracts ,

In determining 1 revenue on client assignments it is necessary for the Group to make certain estimates as

- to the stage of completion of those assignments. In doing so the Group estimates the remaining time and

additional costs to be incurred: in completing the assignments, . and the client's ability to pay for the
services being provided.

A different assessment of these estimates could result in a different value being determined for revenue,
and also for the value of unbilled client work being carried i in the balance sheet.

Intangible assets, including goodwill

The Group has recognised client relationships and goodwill arising from business combinations with a

carrying value of £2,937,783 at the reporting date (see note 12). The Group has taken advantage of the
exemption available in FRS102 from restating the goodwill arising on business combinations arising prior.
to the date of transition to FRS102.

The fair value of client relationships acquired on business combinations involved the use of valuation

techniques to estimate the future level of profitability expected to arise from those relationships. On

acquisition, the Group determines a reliable estimate of the useful economic life of goodwill and other
intangible assets based upon factors such as the expected use of the acquired business, forecasts of
expected future results and cash flows, and expected client attrition rates, as well as any legal, regulatory
or contractual provisions that can limit useful life. :

At each Subsequent reporting date the designated members consider whether there are any factors such
as changes in market conditions that indicate a need to reconsider the useful life of goodwill and other
intangible assets. :

Where an indication of impairment is identified it is necessary to estimate the recoverable value of
intangible assets. This requires estimation of both the net realisable value of the Cash Generating Unit
(CGU) to which the assets belong, and their value in use. The principal estimates used in this
determination are the future cash flows the CGU's are expected to generate and also the selection of

appropriate discount rates in order to calculate the net present values of those cash flows. .

‘Judgments in applying accounting policies (continued)

Freehold property

The Group has recognised freehold property with a carrying value of £1,700,875 at the reporting date (see
note 13). The accounting policy adopted by the Group requires that these assets are ‘stated at their cost
less provision for depreciation and impairment. At acquisition the Group determines reliable estimates for
the useful life of the property and ‘its residual value. These estimates are based upon such factors as the
expected use of the property and market conditions. At subsequent reporting dates the designated
members consider whether there are any factors such as changes in market conditions that indicate a.
need to reconsider the estimates used. .

Based upon their estimates, the designated members have concluded that the residual value of property

is such that any provision for depreciation would not be material, and accordingly no depreciation has .
been recognised in respect of freehold property.

Financial instruments
Financial management

The Group has exposure to two main areas of risk — liquidity risk and client credit exposure. The Group
has established a risk and financial management framework whose. primary. objective is to mitigate the
Group's exposure to risk in order to protect it from events that may hinder its performance or risk damage
to the Group's reputation.

Liquidity risk.

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they
fall due. The Group’s objective’ in managing liquidity risk is to ensure that this does not arise. Having
assessed future cash flow requirements the Group expects to be able to meet its financial obligations
through the cash flows that are.generated from its operating activities. In the event that these cash flows -

. would not be sufficient to enable the Group to meet all of its obligations the Group has available overdraft

facilities provided by its bankers which are drawn upon as required. The interest rate risk arising from

these facilities is considered by the designated members to be minimal, and the Group has not entered

into any derivative instruments designed to mitigate exposure to such risk. In addition the Group can
require ‘members to make additional capital contributions in order to support the fi nancial position of the
Group if alternative sources of finance cannot be sourced.

Client credit exposure . , . .

The Group regularly offers credit:terms to its clients which allow for payment of the debt after delivery of
the related services. The Group is at risk to the extent that a client may be unable to pay the debt within
those terms. This risk is mitigated by strong on-going client relationships and by only granting credit to
clients who are able to demonstrate an appropriate payment history” and satisfy credit worthiness
procedures.
