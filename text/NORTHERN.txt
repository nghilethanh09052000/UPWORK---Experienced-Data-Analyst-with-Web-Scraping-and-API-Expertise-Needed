Wales. The company's registered number and registered office address can be found on the
Company Information page.

The presentation currency of the financial statements is the Pound Sterling (£).
2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of preparing the financial statements

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102
“The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland" including the
provisions of Section 1A "Small Entities" and the Companies Act 2006. The financial statements have
been prepared under the historical cost convention.

Significant judgements and estimates
No judgements have been made in the process of applying the accounting policies that have had the
most significant effect on amounts recognised in the financial statements.

There are no key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty
at the reporting date that have a significant risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. ,

Turnover
Turnover is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, excluding
discounts, rebates, value added tax and other sales taxes.

Tangible fixed assets ,
Depreciation is provided at the following annual rates in order to write off each asset over its
estimated useful life.

improvements to property - 2%on cost
Plant and machinery - 15% on reducing balance
Computer equipment - 33% on cost

Tangible fixed assets are originally recognised at cost (or deemed cost). Cost includes all costs
directly attributable to making the asset capable of operating as intended.

2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued
’ Taxation
Taxation for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Income
Statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income
or directly in equity.

Current or deferred taxation assets and liabilities are not discounted.

Current tax is recognised at the amount of tax payable using the tax rates and laws that have been
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.

Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed
at the balance sheet date.

Timing differences arise from the inclusion of income and expenses in tax assessments in periods
different from those in which they are recognised in financial statements. Deferred tax is measured
using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the year end and that
are expected to apply to the reversal of the timing difference.

Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is
probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future
taxable profits.

Pension costs and other post-retirement benefits
The company operates a defined contribution pension scheme. Contributions payable to the
company's pension scheme are charged to profit or loss in the period to which they relate.

Grant income
Grants are recognised at the fair value of the asset received or receivable when there is reasonable
assurance that the company will comply with conditions attaching to them.

Financial instruments

Financial instruments are classified and account for, according to the substance of the contractual
arrangement, as either financial assets, financial liabilities or equity instruments. An equity
instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the company after
deducting all of its liabilities.

3. EMPLOYEES AND DIRECTORS

The average number of employees during the year was 13 (2023 - 14).
