STRATEGIC REPORT
for the year ended 30 June 2024

The directors submit their Strategic Report for the year ended 30 June 2024 for ICA Commercial Services Limited
(‘the Company’).

PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES, REVIEW OF THE BUSINESS AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS

The Company’s strategy is to deliver sustainable and growing profits by providing a quality training service,
specialising in international compliance and anti-money laundering, to industry, commerce, the professions and
the financial and public sectors.

The Company’s long-term growth prospects are expected to be sustained by the continued demand for
professional high quality training. Constant changes in legislation, increasing levels of regulation and its
commitment to developing new products is anticipated to create demand for the type of high quality training it
provides. The directors expect this activity to continue for the foreseeable future.

Revenue increased from £14,698,344 in 2023 to £16,187,932 in 2024, and profit before taxation increased from
£4,842,032 in 2023 to £6,640,490 in 2024. Total net assets as at 30 June 2024 were £14,254,813 (2023:
£9,125,249). During the year the Company had exceptional gains of £223,088 (2023: £nil) relating to the waiving
of 0% interest intercompany loans with fellow group companies which were liquidated in the year.

BUSINESS OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGY

The Company seeks to deliver sustainable growing profit from its portfolio of services in a number of markets
through continued commitment to building strong management teams, organisational effectiveness, investment in
technology and tight cost control. The Company’s portfolio of products increased during the financial year.

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES

A key challenge facing the Company arises from the highly competitive and rapidly changing nature of its markets
and from legal and regulatory uncertainties. The Company is impacted by changes in professional regulations
(often positive) and by the economic cycle on training expenditure.

A further key business risk and uncertainty affecting the Company arises from rapidly changing technology, which
gives rise to the need for constant development and investment.

Further discussion of these risks and uncertainties, in the context of Wilmington plc as a whole, is provided in the
group's annual report, which does not form part of this report.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

interest rate risk, liquidity risk and capital risk are managed on a group-wide basis by the Company's ultimate
parent company, Wilmington plc. The Company operates in accordance with funding policies controlled by the
execulive directors of the ultimate parent company. The Company is exposed to credit risk associated with selling
on credit, which it manages through credit control procedures.

KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS

The directors of KCA Commercial Services Limited and Wilmington plc manage the group's operations on a
divisional basis. For this reason, the Company's directors believe that analysis of key performance indicators for
the Company is not necessary or appropriate for an understanding of the development, performance or position
of the business of ICA Commercial Services Limited. The development, performance and position of the
divisions, which includes the Company, is discussed in the group's annual report, which does not form part of this
report.

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
for the year ended 30 June 2024

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
The directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report and the financial statements

directors have prepared the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice), including Financial Reporting
Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (FRS 101).

Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period.
In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:

select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;

make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;

state whether applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 have been

followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and

Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company
and the group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They
are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the group and hence for taking reasonable
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities

ICA Commercial Services Limited
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
for the year ended 30 June 2024

GENERAL INFORMATION

ICA Commercial Services Limited (‘the Company’) continues to provide a quality training service, specialising
in international compliance and anti-money laundering, to industry, commerce, the professions and the financial
and public sectors. The Company is a private company and is incorporated and domiciled in the UK. The address
of the registered office is Suite 215/216 Fort Dunlop, 2! Floor, Fort Parkway, Birmingham, B24 9FD.

1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These
policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.

BASIS OF PREPARATION

The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101, ‘Reduced
Disclosure Framework’ (FRS 101). The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost
convention and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.

The Company is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Wilmington plc and is included in the consolidated
financial statements of Wilmington plc, which are publicly available. The Company is therefore exempt by virtue
of Section 400 of the Companies Act 2006 from the requirement to prepare group financial statements. These
financial statements present information about the Company as an individual undertaking and not about its group.

The Company has applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures:
e  =©Cash flow statement and related notes;
e Disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries;
* Disclosures in respect of capital management;
e Certain disclosures in respect of IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers;
© Comparative period reconciliations for share capital;
© = The effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs; and
© Disclosures in respect of compensation of key management personne] and transactions entered into
between two or more wholly-owned members of a group.

As the consolidated financial statements of Wilmington ple include the equivalent disclosures, the Company has
also taken the exemptions FRS 101 available in respect of the following disclosures:

e IFRS 2 Share Based Payments in respect of group settled share based payments; and

e =©Certain disclosures required by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement and IFRS 7 Financial Instruments.

GOING CONCERN

The directors confirm that they are satisfied that the Company has adequate resources to continue in business for
the foresceable future, being a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements.
For these reasons the directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements

REVENUE
Revenue is measured at the transaction price and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided
in the normal course of business, net of discounts and other sales-related taxes.

Revenue is recognised at a point in time when a performance obligation is satisfied by transferring a good or
service to the customer. An asset is transferred when the customer obtains contro] of that asset. Revenue is
recognised over time when a performance obligation is satisfied by the customer simultaneously receiving and
consuming the benefits over the period of the contract.

When payment is received in advance of a performance obligation being satisfied it is recorded on the balance
sheet as deferred revenue, Revenue is then recognised at the point in time or over the period that the performance
obligation is satisfied.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
for the year ended 30 June 2024

1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

INVESTMENTS

Investments in subsidiaries are valued at cost less provision for impairment. The Company evaluates the carrying
value of fixed asset investments to determine if there has been impairment in value, which would result in the
inability to recover the carrying amount. When it is determined that the carrying value exceeds the recoverable
amount, the excess is written off to the statement of comprehensive income.

TAXATION
Current tax for the current and prior years is provided at the amount expected to be paid (or recovered) using the
tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.

PENSIONS

The Company operates a defined contribution pension scheme, the assets of which are held separately from those
of the Company in an independently administered fund. Contributions are charged to the statement of
comprehensive income in the period in which they are incurred. The Company has no further obligation once the
contributions have been paid.

FOREIGN CURRENCIES

Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet
date. All differences are taken to the statement of comprehensive income.

DIVIDENDS

Dividends are recognised in the financial statements when the shareholders’ right to receive payment is
established. Dividend income from subsidiary undertakings is recognised in the financial statements when
subsidiaries have declared interim or final dividends.

TRADE AND OTHER DEBTORS

Trade debtors are initially recognised at the transaction price, which is usually the invoiced amount. They are
subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method (if the time value of money is
significant), less provisions made for doubtful debts using the expected credit losses model. Provisions are made
where there is cvidence of a risk of non-payment taking inlo account ageing, previous losses experienced and
general economic conditions. For trade debtors, the Company applies the simplified approach which requires
expected lifetime losses to be recognised from the initial recognition of the debtor.

AMOUNTS OWED BY GROUP UNDERTAKINGS

Amounts owed by group undertakings are recognised initially at fair value, and subsequently at amortised cost
using the effective interest rate method, less provision for impairment. The Company recognises expected credit
losses using a lifetime expected loss allowance unless the asset is considered to have a low credit risk, in which
case the loss allowance recognised is limited to 12 months’ expected losses. Amounts owed by group undertakings
are classified according to the intention of repayment of the loans.

TRADE AND OTHER CREDITORS

Trade and other creditors are initially recognised at fair value, which is usually the invoiced amount. They are
subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method (if the time value of money is
significant).

AMOUNTS OWED TO GROUP UNDERTAKINGS

Amounts owed to group undertakings are recognised initially at fair value, and subsequently at amortised cost
using the effective interest rate method. Amounts owed to group undertakings are classified according to the
intention of repayment of the loans.

IMPACT OF ADOPTION OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
There has been no material impact on the financial statements from the adoption of new standards or amendments
in the year ended 30 June 2024.
