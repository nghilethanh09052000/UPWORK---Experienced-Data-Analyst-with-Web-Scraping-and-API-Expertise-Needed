Accounting policies

2.1

Basis of preparation of financial statements

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention unless otherwise
specified within these accounting policies and in accordance with FRS 102 ‘The Financial Reporting
Standard applicable in the UK and the Republic of Ireland’ and the requirements of the Companies
Act 2006. The disclosure requirements of Section 1A of FRS 102 have been applied other than

The preparation of financial statements in compliance with FRS 102 requires the use of certain
critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise judgment in applying the
Company's accounting policies.

Foreign currency translation

Functional and presentation currency:

The Company's functional and presentational currency is GBP.

Transactions and balances

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the spot exchange
rates at the dates of the transactions.

At each period end foreign currency monetary items are translated using the closing rate. Non-
monetary items measured at historical cost are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the
transaction and non-monetary items measured at fair value are measured using the exchange rate
when fair value was determined.

Revenue

Turnover is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods and
services provided in the normal course of business, and is shown net of VAT and other sales related

taxes. .

The company's main source of income is from the delivery of qualifications. Income is recognised on
an accruals basis over the duration of each learners course, making due allowance for changes in
each learners circumstances which impacts upon the level of income due to the company from
learners employers.

Additional income has been recognised on the accruals basis from the training and mentoring of
employers on the retention and development of apprentices.

2.6

Borrowing costs

All borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the year in which they are incurred.

Pensions

Defined contribution pension plan

The Company operates a defined contribution plan for its employees. A defined contribution plan is a
pension plan under which the Company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. Once the
contributions have been paid the Company has no further payment obligations.

The contributions are recognised as an expense in profit or loss when they fall due. Amounts not paid
are shown in accruals as a liability in the Balance Sheet. The assets of the plan are held separately
from the Company in independently administered funds.

Taxation

Tax is recognised in profit or loss except that a charge attributable to an item of income and expense
recognised as other comprehensive income or to an item recognised directly in equity is also
recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.

The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of tax rates and laws that have been
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date in the countries where the Company
operates and generates income.

Tangible fixed assets

Tangible fixed assets under the cost model are stated at historical cost less accumulated
depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Historical cost includes expenditure that is
directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of

operating in the manner intended by management.

Depreciation is charged so as to allocate the cost of assets less their residual value over their
estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method.

Depreciation is provided on the following basis: °

Motor vehicles - 4 years
Fixtures and fittings - 3 years
Computer equipment - 3 years

The assets’ residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted
prospectively if appropriate, or if there is an indication of a significant change since the last reporting
date.

Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount
and are recognised in profit or loss.
