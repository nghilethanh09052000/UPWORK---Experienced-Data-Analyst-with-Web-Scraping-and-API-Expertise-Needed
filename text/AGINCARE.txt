GROUP STRATEGIC REPORT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2024

Introduction
The directors present their strategic report for the year ended 31 July 2024.
Business review

The Company is a holding company with subsidiaries operating in the care sector and their principal activity is
the provision of social care services to Local Authorities. Integrated Care Systems (ICS) and private individuals,
mainly across the Southern and Midlands regions, though increasingly into wider geographical areas of
England. The group's operations include day care, home care, live in care and extra cara provision, together
with an Ofsted registered training company.

The Company continues to maintain a strong cash position, with marginal debt, and the year saw ongoing
investment activity in new service provision and acquisitions, digital transformation upgrades, refurbishments of
existing accommodation, and supporting growth and quality improvements in existing services. Energy prices,
food prices and cost of trades and materials continued to have a direct impact on costs, as did increasing
workforce costs.

Total revenue increased by £2.6m in the year to £49.5m. This improvement was driven primarily by an increase
in fee rate inflation.

The profit for the period, after taxation, amounted to £1.09m reflecting a reduction in agency usage, maturing
new service developments and a recovery after of heavy workforce investment in the prior year.

Investment in our workforce resulted in staff costs increasing £2m, which included an £85k investment into
learning and development.

Principat risks and uncertainties

From the perspective of the Company, the principal risks and uncertainties are integrated with the principal risks
of the wider Group and are not managed separately.

Agincare as a group of related companies has traded for many years and has successfully navigated numerous
economic cycles and challenging periods. The experienced team, strong management structure and diverse
range of services enables proactive risk assessment and prompt decision-making and the group continues
strongly despite ongoing political, societal and sector challenges.

The board meets regularly to consider risks and challenges and is confident in its ability to predict and plan for
these, or to respond appropriately where unforeseen circumstances arise. Where costs increase quickly, or
simply continue to rise, there is always risk in the time it takes our mainly public sector partners to respond to
this in terms of fee increases: as well as whether any increases adequately reflect the increased costs.
However, aur experience, strong relationships and cashflow, plus low debt pasition enable us ta manage such
events. in some locations, further diversification into services provided to peapie funding their own care
supports this.

Financial risk

The company's principal financial instruments comprise bank balances, trade debtors, trade creditors and
intercompany loans. Alt of the business' cash balances are held in such a way that achieves a competitive rate
of interest. The Company has minimal borrowings and can consolidate quickly fo minimise risk where
necessary.

Trade debtors within the company’s operations are managed in respect of credit and cash flow risk by policies
concerning the credit offered to customers and the regular monitoring of amounts outstanding for both time and
credit limits. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful debtors. Trade

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2024

creditors’ liquidity risk is managed by ensuring sufficient funds are available to meet amounts as they become
due. The business manages the liquidity risk by ensuring that there are sufficient funds to meet the repayments.
The amounts owed to and from group undertakings have arisen due to the Group's working capital
requirements. Due to the strong trading performance of the group, all amounts owed to the Company are
considered recoverable. Combined with the cash at bank the Company would be able to settle in full the
balance owed to group undertakings should they be called in.

The Company and its subsidiaries continue to operate in areas of growth, both in terms of demographics and
growing markets. However, the sector is becoming increasingly competitive and experiences constant margin
pressure fromm rising labour and material costs only partially being offset by rate increases from local authorities
and ICSs. Contracts are less secure and the costs and challenges of attracting and retaining a skilled workforce
are ever present.

Increasingly, the complex needs of people requiring our services, especially prevalent in the local authority and
health funded work we manage, create higher costs and risks, as well as pressures on our workforce at all
levels. The backdrop of a fragile and insecure social care funding position nationally remains and has required
careful financial and operational management to ensure that service delivery, quality and workforce
development and support are not impacted.

With ongoing challenges to public funding, there will be continued focus on the longer term viability and
sustainability of all of our operations, alongside ambitious planned growth and development of the range and
breadth service provision. The Directors remain confident in their market knowledge and ability, which has
always enabled us to move quickly to adapt existing service provision where necessary, whilst still seeking new
opportunities. Strong succession planning and adapting to changing market conditions, whilst retaining the
‘heart and soul’ values of what remains a family-owned business, remains key to our sustainability.

Investment in our workforce has continued and our increasing presence in London has necessitated us
providing employment contracts in-line with the London Living Wage and the Ethical Care Charter. However,
our longer term commitment to increase wages and contractual terms remains a significant challenge when
local authority and NHS funding and commissioning is so limited and when central government policy and
funding plans only cover short-term funding commitments.

Financial key performance indicators

The board receives KPI and financial management information on a weekly and monthly basis with full quarterly
reporting and review at quarterly board meetings.

KPls inchide targets against care home occupancy, volume of hours, number of live-in care packages,
occupancy in tenancies and delivered services against agreed budget. Budgets are set based on long term
experience, sector and competitor information and long-term planning.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2024

Directors’ statement of compliance with duty to promote the success of the Group

The directors are aware of their duties with regard to S.172 of the Companies Act 2006 and they act and make
decisions in good faith in a way that they believe is most likely to promote the success of the Group for the
benefit of its members. In doing so the board has had regard to the following:

- The likely consequences of any decision in the lang term

- The interests of the Group’s employees

- The need to foster the Group's business relationships with suppliers, customers and others
- The impact of the Group’s operations on the community and the environment

~ The desirability of the Group maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct
- The need to act fairly between members of the Group.

The Directors will always consider the impact of decisions on all ralevant stakeholder groups, although it is
noted that the outcomes desired by each group are not always aligned. The Directors ensure that they act as a
responsible corporate citizen whilst also taking account of the Group’s core purpose, vision and values.

Across the Group there are experienced board members with varying backgrounds, knowledge and training
providing a strength and depth which facilitates constructive debate and decision making. Agincare Holdings
Limited and its subsidiaries hold quarterly board meetings to ensure strong governance of all business divisions.
The following section of this report details some of the factors the board has considered regarding Section 172.

Long Term Direction

The Group's strategy is reviewed continually through the year and is still felt ta be appropriate for the tong-term
success of the business and consistent with the Group’s current 5-year plan. There is an annual review of the
vision, mission and values of the Group, as well as of the short, medium and long-term plans, board skills,
succession-planning and any issues arising.

The board have already commenced discussions around the next 5-year plan, with the expectation of further
growth across all services provided by the Group through both organic growth and acquisitions. There are
additional strategy and discussion days for all Directors, which promote broader thinking af emerging trends and
expectations, consideration of risks and a reinforcement of the strong value base and ethos underpinning our
work. Despite the challenges facing the sector we operate in, there is shared ambition, passion and confidence
in a long term, sustainable future for the Group.

Group Employees

The Directors recognise that our teams are critical to the success of our business and acknowledge the
excellent work that they carry out each day. The board always consider how their decisions may impact on our
employees and ensure they have a safe working environment. Work to encourage a ‘one team’ approach
across operating and support functions continues, strengthening culture and aiding retention.

The board has agreed areas of ongoing focus with our employees are further strengthening health and well-
being support, alongside enhancing employee engagement and the influence of such feedback on our future
strategy and provision of services. Systems that support this work are also being improved via increased use of
digital systems, as well as significant investment in learning and development, the Agincare People Programme
work and the ‘candidate journey’ which people experience when joining Agincare.

Directors also play key roles in local, regional and national shaping of the sector using their roles where possible
to influence the sector, particularly in relation to raising public awareness and promoting the skills,
professionalism, recognition, remuneration and well-being of the wider social care workforce. Broader and
increasingly meaningful engagement with our workforce remains a key focus.

GROUP STRATEGIC REPORT (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2024

Relationships with Supplier, Customers and Other Stakeholders

The Group has always placed a value in strong and effective commercial and contracts management. Our
largest customers are our public sector partners, who we develop strong relationships with in terms of delivering
against specified contracts or facilitating new and innovative projects that add value to their local communities.
In terms of supply chains, we often work closely with long-term suppliers, many of whom are focal in our
communities and believe in open, transparent ways of working together regarding due diligence, risk
management, reputational management and with strong, aligned values in terms of business approach.

An increasing volume of private pay work means interaction and relationship management with a more
dispersed range of individuals and families. Our various communication and feedback methods ensure that the
views of all those drawing on our services, alongside key public sector partners, are gathered and reflected
upon as part of our ongoing customer service and development. Social media has formed an increased role in
this communication. Feedback is always woven into our business planning and service delivery.

Impact of the Group’s Operation on the Community and the Environment

The Group and board have always had a strong value base underpinning our organisation and a key part of this
has been linked to our strapline “Caring in Your Community”. A belief in locations that are in the heart of
communities and form active parts of communities is key. This approach is followed in turn at our head office
where the Chairman and shareholder, as well as the Company, has personally invested significant amounts into
regeneration and heritage projects providing proven social value.

The Nirertors are also committed to ‘giviny back’, with senior directors holding voluntary board positions for
small charities, CICs and suchlike. The Company also donates to, and promotes, charitable events across alll
locations covering issues relevant to social care and important to our team members. Where possible we share
our skills, resources and experience to support individuals or organisations in our local communities. An ESG
committee also gives focus to these areas, including social value contributions, which are increasingly being
measured by public sector partners.

Maintaining a reputation for High Standards of Business

We pride ourselves on our reputation, built over 38 years of operating with a broad customer base, and the
recognition we receive at a national level for market leadership and innovation. Our Chairman is a Chartered
Director with the Institute of Directors and has always embedded strong corporate governance at all levels.

The majority of turnover is derived from public sector partnerships where our reputation and robustness of
policy and governance is routinely measured through competitive tender practices, expansion of existing
relationships on new project and partnership work, and extensions of key contracts over many years. We have
increasingly been seen as a quality, sustainable organisation to support transfers of services where other
providers may be unable to continue or wish to consolidate their operations.

We are part of the Care Quality Commission Market Oversight scheme, which provides external scrutiny on our
performance in terms of financial stability and quality standards.

There is focus on high levels of quality and customer service, again evidenced by increasing amounts of
external reviews and ratings achieved, alongside our internal surveys.

Our Directors contribute to national policy forums and broader work for the sector, such as the development of
good practice documents, reflecting the commitment not only to our own high standards of business but a wish
to drive improvements in standards across the social care sector. Similarly, in Dorset where our head office sits,
there is active involvement in economic growth and skills creation, using our significant presence ta support
various community and business activity.

consideration of where, why and how investment of resource and funds may be directed between members of
the Group at any given time.

Directors are encouraged to work collaboratively for the cammon purpose of the Group, our workforce and all
customers and stakeholders, whilst recognising their obligations to their own businesses. This is achieved by
ensuring attention is focussed on individual subsidiaries and performance, whilst fostering a collective ambition
and understanding between afl group directors and teams in the context of political, social and economic
activity.

Greenhouse gas emission, energy consumption and energy efficiency action

The Directors acknowledge the importance of assessing and monitaring energy usage and emissions in line
with the requirements under the Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme (ESOS) and The Streamlined Energy and
Carbon Reporting Regulation (SECR). This work receives ongoing focus and review of steps that can be taken
to strengthen activity, action-planning and outcomes in this area.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF AGINCARE GROUP LIMITED

Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of Agincare Group Limited (the 'parent Company’) and its subsidiaries
(the ‘Group’) for the year ended 31 July 2024, which comprise the Consolidated statement of comprehensive
income, the Consolidated balance sheet, the Company balance sheet, the Consolidated statement of cash
flows, the Consolidated statement of changes in equity, the Company statement of changes in equity and the
related notes, including a summary of significant accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that has
been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including
Financial Reporting Standard 402 ‘The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of
Irefand' (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

In our opinion the financial statements:

give a true and fair view of the state of the Group's and of the parent Company's affairs as at 31 July
2024 and of the Group's profit for the year then ended;

. have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice; and

have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable
law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors' responsibilities for the audit
of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the
ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the United Kingdom, including
the Financial Reporting Council's Ethical Standard and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in
accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Conclusions relating to going concern

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the gaing concern basis of
accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or
conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group's or the parent Company's
ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements
are authorised for issue.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the
relevant sections of this report.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF AGINCARE GROUP LIMITED (CONTINUED)

Other information

The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report other than the financial
statements and our Auditors’ report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained
within the Annual Report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the ather information and,
except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance
conclusion therean. Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the
other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course
of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or
apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material
misstatement in the financial statements themselves. ff, based on the wark we have performed, we conclude
that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006

In our opinion, based on the wark undertaken in the course of the audit:

. the information given in the Group strategic report and the Directors’ report for the financial year for which

AGINCARE GROUP LIMITED

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF AGINCARE GROUP LIMITED (CONTINUED)

Responsibilities of directors

As explained more fully in the Directors' responsibilities statement set out on page 6, the directors are
responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair
view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group's and the parent
Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern
and using the gaing concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the
parent Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an Auditors’ report that includes our
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Group financial statements.

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of nan-compliance with laws and regulations. We design
procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of
irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities,
including fraud is detailed below:

enquiring of management concerning actual and potential litigation and claims;

performing analytical procedures to identify any unusual results that may indicate risks of material
misstatement due to fraud;

reading minutes of meetings;

assessing any management override of controls by testing journal entries and other adjustments and
reviewing accounting estimates for indications of potential bias;

evaluating any transactions that are unusual or outside the normal course of business; and

« maintaining alert to any fraud risks throughout the audit.

Because of the inherent limitations of an audit, there is a risk that we will not detect all irregularities, including
those leading to a material misstatement in the financial statements or non-compliance with regulation. This risk
increases the more that compliance with a law or regulation is removed from the events and transactions
reflected in the financial statements, as we will be less likely to become aware of instances of non-compliance.
The risk is also greater regarding irregularities occurring due to fraud rather than error, as fraud involves
intentional concealment, forgery, collusion, omission or misrepresentation.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial
Reporting Council's website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our
Auditors' report.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2024

nN

General information

Agincare Group Limited is a private company limited by shares. The company was incorporated in the
United Kingdom and is registered in England and Wales. The company's registered office is Agincare
House, Admiralty Buildings, Castletown, Portland, Dorset, DTS 1BB.

Accounting policies

2.1

Basis of preparation of financial statements

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention unless otherwise
specified within these accounting policies and in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102,
the Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and the Republic of Ireland and the
Companies Act 2006.

The preparation of financial statements in compliance with FRS 102 requires the use of certain
critical accounting estimates. It also requires Group management to exercise judgment in applying
the Group's accounting policies (see note 3).

The Company has taken advantage of the exemption allowed under section 408 of the Companies
Act 2006 and has not presented its own Statement of comprehensive income in these financial
statements.

The following principal accounting policies have been applied:
Basis of consolidation

The Company is a parent company that is also a subsidiary included in the consolidated financial
statements of a larger group by a parent undertaking established under the law of any part of the
United Kingdom and is therefore exempt from the requirement to prepare consolidated financial
statements under section 400 of the Companies Act 2006.

However, the directors have chosen to prepare intermediate consolidated financial statements for
Agincare Group Limited as they believe this gives users of these financial statements a better
understanding of the trading group.

The consolidated financial statements present the results of the Company and its own subsidiaries
(‘the Group") as if they form a single entity. Intercompany transactions and balances between group
companies are therefore eliminated in full.

The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of business combinations using the
purchase method. In the Balance sheet, the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent
liabilities are initially recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date. The results of acquired
operations are included in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the date on
which control is obtained. They are deconsolidated from the date control ceases.

The Group continues to recognise a merger reserve which arose on a past business combination
that was accounted for as a merger in accordance with UK GAAP as applied at that time.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2024

Accounting policies (continued)

2.3. Going concern

The Board considers Agincare has the resources in place to meet immediate and longer term
challenges. The degree of challenge faced will be to some extent dependent on the actions taken by
central and local government to support the social care sector as a whole. however with strong
national lobbying and sector relationships, Agincare is actively influencing better understanding of
the issues arising for the sector and of the funding required to address these. Employee welfare,
support and communication has been enhanced to ensure that we retain a positive and effective
workforce and equaily proactive work is taking place with all stakeholders to ensure that Agincare
remains responsive to this changing and ongoing situation.

2.4 Revenue

Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the
Group and the revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is measured as the fair value of the
consideration received or receivable, excluding discounts, rebates, value added tax and other sales
taxes. The following criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised:

Rendering of services
Revenue from a contract to provide services is recognised in the period in which the services are

provided in accordance with the stage of completion of the contract when all of the following
conditions are satisfied:

. the amount of revenue can be measured reliably;

° it is probable that the Group will receive the consideration due under the contract;

. the stage of completion of the contract at the end af the reporting period can be measured
reliably, and

. the cosis incurred and the costs to complete the contract can be measured reliably.

2.5 Operating leases: the Group as lessee

Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to profit or lass on a straight-line basis over the
lease term.

Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to sign an operating lease are recognised on a
straight-line basis over the lease term, unless another systematic basis is representative of the time
pattern of the lessee’s benefit from the use of the leased asset.

2.6 Government grants

Grants are accounted under the accruals model as permitted by FRS 102, Grants relating to
expenditure on tangible fixed assets are credited to profit or loss at the same rate as the
depreciation on the assets to which the grant relates. The deferred element of grants is included in
creditors as deferred income.

Grants of a revenue nature are recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income
in the same period as the related expenditure.

Accounting policies (continued)

Interest income

Interest income is recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method.

Finance costs

Finance costs are charged to profit or loss over the term of the debt using the effective interest
method so that the amount charged is at a constant rate on the carrying amount. Issue costs are
initially recognised as a reduction in the proceeds of the associated capital instrument.

Pensions

Defined contribution pension plan

The Group operates a defined contribution plan for its employees. A defined contribution plan is a
pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. Once the
contributions have been paid the Group has no further payment obligations.

The contributions are recognised as an expense in profit or loss when they fall due. Amounts not

paid are shown in accruals as a liability in the Balance sheet. The assets of the plan are held
separately frorn the Group in independently administered funds.

2.10 Share-based payments

Where share options are awarded to employees, the fair value of the options at the date of grant is
charged to profit or loss over the vesting period. Non-market vesting conditions are taken into
account by adjusting the number of equity instruments expected to vest at each balance sheet date
so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is based on the
number of options that eventually vest. Market vesting conditions are factored into the fair value of
the options granted. The cumulative expense is not adjusted for failure to achieve a market vesting
condition.

The fair value of the award also takes into account non-vesting conditions. These are either factors
beyond the control of either party (such as a target based on an index) or factors which are within
the control of one or other of the parties (such as the Group keeping the scheme open or the
employee maintaining any contributions required by the scheme).

Where the terms and conditions of options are modified before they vest, the increase in the fair
value of the options, measured immediately before and after the modification, is also charged to
profit or loss over the remaining vesting period.

Where equity instruments are granted to persons other than employees, profit or lass is charged
with fair value of goods and services received.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2024

2. Accounting policies {continued}
2.11 Current and deferred taxation

The tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in profit or loss
except that a charge attributable to an item of income and expense recognised as other
comprehensive income or to an item recognised directly in equity is also recognised in other
comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively,

The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of tax rates and laws that have been
enacted or substantively enacted by the bafance sheet date in the countries where the Company and
the Group operate and generate income.

Deferred tax balances are recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not
reversed by the balance sheet date, except that:

. The recognition of deferred tax assets is limited to the extent that it is probable that they will
be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits;

. Any deferred tax balances are reversed if and when all conditions for retaining associated tax
allowances have been met; and

. Where they relate to timing differences in respect of interests in subsidiaries, associates,
branches and joint ventures and the Group can control the reversal of the timing differences
and such reversal is not considered probable in the foreseeable future.

Deferred tax balances are not recognised in respect of permanent differences except in respect of
business combinations, when deferred tax is recognised on the differences between the fair values
of assets acquired and the future tax deductions available for them and the differences between the
fair values of liabilities acquired and the amount that will be assessed for tax. Deferred tax is
determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance
sheet date.

2. Accounting policies (continued)

2.12 Intangible assets
Goodwill

Goodwill represents the difference between amounts paid on the cost of a business combination and
the acquirer's interest in the fair value of the Group’s share of its identifiable assets and liabilities of
the acquiree at the date of acquisition. Subsequent to initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost
less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is amortised on a
straight-line basis to the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income over its useful economic
life.

Other intangible assets
Intangible assets are initially recognised at cost. After recognition, under the cost model, intangible
assets are mé@asured at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment

losses.

All intangible assets are considered to have a finite useful life. If a reliable estimate of the useful life
cannot be made, the useful life shall not exceed ten years.

The estimated useful lives range as follows:
Goodwill - 18 and 20 years straight line
2.13 Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets under the cost model are stated at historical cost less accumulated
depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Historical cost includes expenditure that is
directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable

of operating in the manner intended by management.

Depreciation ig charged so as to allocate the cost of assets less their residual value over their
estimated useful lives, using the straight-line and reducing balance methods.

Depreciation is provided on the following basis:

Long-term leasehold property = - over the length of the lease
Motor vehicles - 25% reducing balance

Fixtures and fittings - 15% straight line

Computer equipment - 25% straight line

The assets’ residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted
prospectively if appropriate, or if there is an indication of a significant change since the last reporting
date.

Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount
and are recognised in profit or loss.

2.14 Valuation of investments

Investments in subsidiaries are measured at cost less accumulated impairment.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2024

2. Accounting policies (continued)

2.15 Debtors
Short-term debtors are measured at transaction price, less any impairment. Loans receivable are
measured initially at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are measured subsequently at
amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment.

2.16 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash is represented by cash in hand and deposits with financial institutions repayable without
penalty on notice of not more than 24 hours. Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments that
mature in no more than three months from the date of acquisition and that are readily convertible ta
known amounts of cash with insignificant risk of change in value.
In the Consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents are shown net of bank
overdrafts that are repayable an demand and form an integral part of the Group's cash
management.

2.17 Creditors
Short-term creditors are measured at the transaction price. Other financial liabilities, including bank
loans, are measured initially at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are measured subsequently
at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

2.18 Holiday pay accrual
A liability is recognised to the extent of any unused holiday pay entitlement which is accrued at the
balance sheet date and carried forward to future periods. This is measured at the undiscounted
salary cost of the future holiday entitlement so accrued at the balance sheet date.

2.19 Provisions for liabilities

Provisions are recognised when an event has taken place that gives rise to a legal or constructive
obligation, a transfer of economic benefits is probable and a reliable estimate can be made.

Provisions are measured as the best estimate of the amount required to settle the obligation, taking
: into account the related risks and uncertainties.

Increases in provisions are generally charged as an expense to profit or loss.
2.20 Financial instruments

The Group has elected to apply the provisions of Section 11 “Basic Financial Instruments” of FRS
102 to all of its financial instruments.

Financial instruments are recognised in the Group's Balance sheet when the Group becomes party
to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

Financial assets and liabilities are offset, with the net amounts presented in the financial statements,
when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention
ta settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Basic financial assets

Page 27

AGINCARE GROUP LIMITED

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2024

Accounting policies (continued)

2.20 Financial instruments (continued)

Basic financial assets, which include trade and other debtors, cash and bank balances, are initially
measured at their transaction price (adjusted for transaction costs except in the initial measurement
of financial assets that are subsequently measured at fair value through profit and loss) and are
subsequently carried at their amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any provision
for impairment, unless the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where the transaction is
measured at the present value of the future receipts discounted at a market rate of interest.

Discounting is omitted where the effect of discounting is immaterial. The Group's cash and cash
equivalents, trade and most other debtors due with the operating cycle fall into this category of
financial instruments.

Other financial assets

Other financial assets, which includes investments in equity instruments which are not classified as
subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures, are initially measured at fair value, which is normally the
recognised transaction price. Such assets are subsequently measured at fair value with the changes
in fair value being recognised in the profit or loss. Where other financial assets are not publicly
traded, hence their fair value cannot be measured reliably, they are measured at cost less
impairment.

Impairment of financial assets

At the end of each reporting period financial assets measured at amortised cost are assessed for
objective evidence of impairment. If an asset is impaired the impairment loss is the difference
between the carrying amount and the present value of the estimated cash flows discounted at the
asset's original effective interest rate. The impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss.

Financial assets are impaired when events, subsequent to their initial recognition, indicate the
estimated future cash flows derived from the financial asset(s) have been adversely impacted. The
impairment loss will be the difference between the current carrying amount and the present value of
the future cash flows at the asset(s) original effective interest rate.

If there is a favourable change in relation to the events surrounding the impairment loss then the
impairment can be reviewed for possible reversal. The reversal will not cause the current carrying
amount to exceed the original carrying amount had the impairment not been recognised. The
impairment reversal is recognised in the profit or loss.

Financial liabilities

Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according ta the substance of the
contractual arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a
residual interest in the assets of the Group after the deduction of all its liabilities.

Basic financial liabilities, which include trade and other creditors, bank loans, other loans and loans
due to fellow group companies are initially measured at their transaction price (adjusting for
transaction casts except in the initial measurement of financial liabilities that are subsequently
measured at fair value through profit and loss). When this constitutes a financing transaction,
whereby the debt instrument is measured at the present value of the future payments discounted at
a market rate of interest, discounting is omitted where the effect of discounting is immaterial.

Debt instruments are subsequently carried at their amortised cost using the effective interest rate

method.

Trade creditors are obligations to pay for goads and services that have been acquired in the ordinary
course of business from suppliers. Trade creditors are classified as current liabilities if the payment
is due within one year. If not, they represent non-current liabilities. Trade creditors are initially
recognised at their transaction price and subsequently are measured at amortised cost using the
effective interest method. Discounting is omitted where the effect of discounting is immaterial.

Other financial instruments

Derivatives, including forward exchange contracts, futures contracts and interest rate swaps. are not
classified as basic financial instruments. These are initially recognised at fair value on the date the
derivative contract is entered into, with costs being charged to the profit or loss. They are
subsequently measured at fair value with changes in the profit or loss.

Debt instruments that do not meet the conditions as set out in FRS 102 paragraph 11.9 are
subsequently measured at fair value through the profit or loss. This recagnition and measurement
would also apply to financial instruments where the perfarmance is evaluated on a fair value basis
as with a documented risk management or investment strategy.

Derecognition of financial instruments

Derecognition of financial assets

Financial assets are derecognised when their contractual right to future cash flow expire, or are
settled, or when the Group transfers the asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership to another party. If significant risks and rewards of ownership are retained after the
transfer to another party, then the Group will continue to recognise the value of the partion of the
risks and rewards retained.

Derecognition of financial liabilities

Financial liabilities are derecognised when the Group's contractual obligatians expire or are
discharged or cancelled.

2.21 Dividends
Equity dividends are recognised when they become fegally payable. Interim equity dividends are

recognised when paid. Final equity dividends are recognised when approved by the shareholders at
an annual general meeting.

Judgments in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty

The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities as at the balance sheet date and
the amounts reported for revenues and expenses during the period. However, the nature of estimation
means that the actual outcomes could differ from those estimates. The following judgements have had
the most significant effect on amounts recognised in the financial statements:

Amounts owed by Group undertakings

Judgement is required in determining whether there are any indicators of whether the amounts due to the
company from group undertakings are materially impaired. In the event that such indicators are identified
an estimation of the extent to which an impairment has arisen is then required. Taking account of the
group's trading performance and wider financial position, it has been determined that no indicators of
impairment presently exist. Refer to note 17 for details of the amounts owed by group undertakings.

Investments

Judgement is required in determining whether there are any indicators of whether the carrying value of
investments is materially impaired. In the event that such indicators are identified an estimation of the
extent to which an impairment has arisen is then required. Such an estimation process takes into account
the recoverable amount of investments based on either its realisable value or the value of cashflows that
will be generated therefrom. Taking account of the group's trading performance and wider financial
position, it has been determined that no indicators of impairment presently exist. Refer to note 16 for
details of the investments held.

Depreciation & amortisation

Fixed assets are depreciated over their useful economic lives. The actual lives of the assets are
assessed annually and may vary depending on a range of factors. These factors include product life
cycles, maintenance programs of the assets, as well as technological innovation.

The applicable accounting policies detailing these areas are shown in notes 2.12 & 2.13.

Bad debt provision

Bad debts are provided when recoverability is considered to be doubtful. The bad debt provision is
revised on a monthly basis, taking into account outstanding amounts aged > 90 days. The nature of the
industry is such that the collection of debts is often delayed by factors including the finalisation of probate
proceedings.

Turnover

The whole of the turnover is aitriputable to the provision of care services.

All turnover arose within the United Kingdom.

Share-based payments

During the year, the group implemented a Long-term incentive plan (LTIP). Participants in the scheme
were issued Non-Voting shares in the ultimate parent company. Participants in the plan can, at any time
after maturity, require the ultimate parent company to buy back the shares at a pre-agreed sum.

The group must recognise the liability at the present value of the expected cash settlement. This liability
must be revaiued at each reporting date until settlement, and an expense recognised over the service
period in the appropriate group companies to reflect the cost of providing the benefit. A total charge of
£100k (2023: Enil) has been recognised within the profit and loss in relation to the share-based payment
transactions.

Pension commitments

The Group operates a defined contributions pension scheme. The assets of the scheme are held
separately from those of the Group in an independently administered fund. The pension cost charge
represents contributions payable by the Group to the fund and amounted to £494,055 (2023 - £617,373).
Contributions totalling £156,120 (2023: £194,965) were payable to the fund at the balance sheet date
and are included in other creditors.
