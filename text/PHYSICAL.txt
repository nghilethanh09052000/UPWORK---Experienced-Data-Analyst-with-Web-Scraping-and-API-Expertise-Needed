ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of preparing the financial statements

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102 "The Financial
Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland” including the provisions of Section 1A "Small Entities"
and the Companies Act 2006. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.

The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis,which assumes that the company will continue in
operational existence for the foresecable future, which the directors consider appropriate.

Turnover
Turnover represents net invoiced sales of goods and services, excluding value added tax.

Tangible fixed assets

Depreciation is provided at the following annual rates in order to write off each asset over its estimated useful life.
Plant and machinery - 15% straight line

Computer equipment - Straight line over 3 years

Financial instruments
The company only has financial assets and financial liabilities of a kind that qualify as basic financial instruments. Basic
financial instruments are recognised at transaction value and subsequently measured at their settlement value.

Taxation
Taxation for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Statement of Income and Retained
Earnings, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.

Current or deterred taxation assets and liabilities are not discounted.

Current tax is recognised at the amount of tax payable using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the statement of financial position date.

Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the statement of
financial position date.

Timing differences arise from the inclusion of income and expenses in tax assessments in periods different from those in
which they are recognised in financial statements. Deferred tax is measured using tax rates and laws that have been enacted
or substantively enacted by the year end and that are expected to apply to the reversal of the timing difference.

Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that they will be
recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.

Pension costs and other post-retirement benefits

The company operates a defined contribution pension scheme. Contributions payable to the company's pension scheme are
charged to profit or loss in the period to which they relate.
