Notes to the Financial Statements
For The Year Ended 31 July 2024

1. General Information

Springfield Training Limited is a private company, limited by shares, incorporated in England & Wales, registered number
09644119 . The registered office is 19 Albion Street, Hull, East Yorkshire, HU1 3TG.

2. Accounting Policies
2.1. Basis of Preparation of Financial Statements

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with Financial
Reporting Standard 102 section 1A Small Entities "The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of
Ireland" and the Companies Act 2006.

2.2. Turnover

Turnover is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of discounts and value added taxes.
Turnover includes revenue earned from the sale of goods and from the rendering of services. Turnover is reduced for
estimated customer returns, rebates and other similar allowances.

Sale of goods

Turnover from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods has
transferred to the buyer. This is usually at the point that the customer has signed for the delivery of the goods.

Rendering of services

Turnover from the rendering of services is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract. The stage of
completion of a contract is measured by comparing the costs incurred for work performed to date to the total estimated
contract costs, Turnover is only recognised to the extent of recoverable expenses when the outcome of a contract cannot
be estimated reliably.

2.3. Intangible Fixed Assets and Amortisation - Goodwill

Goodwill is the difference between amounts paid on the acquisition of a business and the fair value of the separable net
assets. It is amortised to profit and loss account over its estimated economic life of 5 years.

2.4. Intangible Fixed Assets and Amortisation - Other Intangible
Other intangible assets are development costs. It is amortised to profit and loss account at 15% on cost.
2.5. Research and Development

In the research phase of an internal project it is not possible to demonstrate that the project will generate future
economic benefits and hence all expenditure on research is recognised as an expense when it is incurred. Intangible
assets are recognised from the development phase of a project if and only if certain specific criteria are met in order to
demonstrate the asset will generate probable future economic benefits and that its cost can be reliably measured, The
capitalised development costs are subsequently amortised to ... on a straight line basis over their expected useful
economic lives, which range from ... to ... years.

If it is not possible to distinguish between the research phase and the development phase of an internal project the
expenditure is treated as if it were all incurred in the research phase only.

2.6. Tangible Fixed Assets and Depreciation
Tangible fixed assets are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.

Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost of the fixed assets, less their estimated residual value,
over their expected useful lives on the following bases:

Plant & Machinery 33% on cost
Motor Vehicles 25% on reducing balance
Fixtures & Fittings 33% on cost
Computer Equipment 33% on cost

2.7. Stocks and Work in Progress

Stocks and work in progress are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value after making due allowance for
obsolete and slow-moving stocks. Cost includes all direct costs and an appropriate proportion of fixed and variable
overheads. Work-in-progress is reflected in the accounts on a contract by contract basis by recording turnover and related
costs as contract activity progresses.

Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)
For The Year Ended 31 July 2024

2.8. Taxation
Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.

The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the
statement of comprehensive income because of items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years
and items that are never taxable or deductible. The company’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.

Deferred tax is recognised on timing differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are
generally recognised for all taxable timing differences. Deferred tax assets are generally recognised for all deductible
temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible
timing differences can be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting
period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or
part of the asset to be recovered.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the
liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted
by the end of the reporting period. Deferred tax liabilities are presented within provisions for liabilities and deferred tax
assets within debtors. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflect the tax consequences that would
follow from the manner in which the Company expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying
amount of its assets and liabilities.

Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss for the year, except when they relate to items that are recognised
in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case current and deferred tax are recognised in other
comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.

2.9. Government Grant

Government grants are recognised in the profit and loss account in an appropriate manner that matches them with the
expenditure towards which they are intended to contribute.

Grants for immediate financial support or to cover costs already incurred are recognised immediately in the profit and loss
account. Grants towards general activities of the entity over a specific period are recognised in the profit and loss account
over that period.

Grants towards fixed assets are recognised over the expected useful lives of the related assets and are treated as
deferred income and released to the profit and loss account over the useful life of the asset concerned.

All grants in the profit and loss account are recognised when all conditions for receipt have been complied with.
