NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Year ended 31 August 2023
1.
GENERAL INFORMATION
The company is a private company limited by shares, registered in England and Wales. The address of the registered office is Unit 1 Whimsey Industrial Estate, Steam Mills Road, Cinderford, Gloucestershire, GL14 3JA.
2.
STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE
These financial statements have been prepared in compliance with Section 1A of FRS 102, 'The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and the Republic of Ireland'.
3.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, as modified by the revaluation of certain financial assets and liabilities and investment properties measured at fair value through profit or loss.
The financial statements are prepared in sterling, which is the functional currency of the entity.
Going concern
The accounts show that the company had net liabilities of £120,218 at the balance sheet date. The directors have therefore had to consider the appropriateness of the going concern basis. The company has been able to finance its operations largely because of support from a related company. Were this support not available, the company may not be able to continue trading. The directors are confident that the company will be able to meet its obligations for at least the next twelve months with the continuing support of this creditor. They therefore consider it appropriate to prepare the accounts on the going concern basis.
Turnover
Turnover is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods supplied and services rendered, net of discounts and Value Added Tax. Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the buyer (usually on despatch of the goods); the amount of revenue can be measured reliably; it is probable that the associated economic benefits will flow to the entity; and the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transactions can be measured reliably.
Tangible assets
Tangible assets are initially recorded at cost, and subsequently stated at cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Any tangible assets carried at revalued amounts are recorded at the fair value at the date of revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses. An increase in the carrying amount of an asset as a result of a revaluation, is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity, except to the extent it reverses a revaluation decrease of the same asset previously recognised in profit or loss. A decrease in the carrying amount of an asset as a result of revaluation, is recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent of any previously recognised revaluation increase accumulated in equity in respect of that asset. Where a revaluation decrease exceeds the accumulated revaluation gains accumulated in equity in respect of that asset, the excess shall be recognised in profit or loss.
Depreciation
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost or valuation of an asset, less its residual value, over the useful economic life of that asset as follows:
Plant and machinery
-
12
%
straight line
Fixtures and fittings
-
15

Equipment

Finance leases and hire purchase contracts
Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are recognised in the balance sheet as assets and liabilities at the lower of the fair value of the assets and the present value of the minimum lease payments, which is determined at the inception of the lease term. Any initial direct costs of the lease are added to the amount recognised as an asset. Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the outstanding lease liability using the effective interest method. Finance charges are allocated to each period so as to produce a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.

EMPLOYEE NUMBERS
