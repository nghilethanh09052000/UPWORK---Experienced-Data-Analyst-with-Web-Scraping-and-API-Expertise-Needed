GROUP STRATEGIC REPORT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2024

Principal activities and business review

The main company activity throughout the year continued to be delivering state funded education and vocational training
provision in core subject areas such as Sport and Creative Arts.

The business continued to grow its learner volumes within the SCL College, volumes of learners joining programmes
increased by 6% to 3,563 with the continued growth within both Sport and Creative Arts. The success of obtaining a
national Adult Skills funding contract aswell as the continued development of SCL Professional delivering apprenticeships
saw all government funded revenue streams increase against the prior year.

Other key milestones in the year were the acquisitions of 2 organisations. LEAD Education to support the future growth
plans within Creative Arts and Kick off in Business an expert deliverer of Self Employment business start up qualifications
to support the Adult skills funding contract.

The business set out its 5 year business plan for the future success of the business to continue to develop innovative
teaching & learning experiences to greater volumes of students whilst also supporting our funders to successfully reducing
the volumes of NEETs (young people not in education, employment or training) by delivering high class career pathways to
young adults.

Financial risk management objectives and policies

There are a number of potential risks and uncertainties that could have a material impact on the performance of the Group.
The directors and management team regularly identify, monitor and ensure appropriate processes are put in place to
mitigate potential risks and uncertainties. These risks include, but are not limited to, employees, market competition and
general economic conditions. The directors and management team regularly review the financial requirements of the

Group and the risks associated therewith.

Exposure to price, credit, liquidity and cash flow risk

The national funding formula for 16-18 year olds can be reviewed annually and access to toolkits to measure the impact of
future contracting are utilised in the business to give advanced visibility in order to respond to any risks.

Economic risk

The Group remains a going concern due to the cash management strategy, forward planning and ability to raise funds from-
existing shareholders in the future to support the growth year on year in student volumes.

Competition risk

The main college funding provided by the department for education holds a high barrier to entry into the market. SCL hoids
the second largest contract and is well placed to continue to increase its market share with the diverse offer coming from
the College delivery complimented with career pathways into Higher Education and Apprenticeships leaving the business
flexible to be able to pivot to the evolving education landscape under the new govemment.

Legislative risk

ESFA (Education abd Skills Funding Agency) contracts offer a good amount of lead time for any change to come into force
that helps the business to be able to make the relevant changes intemailly to respond to change effectively. Recent
increases to the funding rates will see an increase of 3.77% applied for 25/26 and the business was recently awarded
additional funding to support the growing NEET population outlining the support to future sustainability of the contracts.

SCL also sits on strategic boards for the Association of Learning Providers to work with the department on the strategic
direction and impact of the funding.

GROUP STRATEGIC REPORT (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2024

Going Concern

The business revenue comes from government funding with the majority of this within the 16-19 College funding which
could provide some risk to the group. This along with high inflation, interest rates and rising costs of living are the key risks

_to the business.

The Business however factors all this into its future financial forecasts and planning it provides a rolling monthly cashflow
forecast and carries out full reforecasts on a quarterly basis in which any potential risks are factored in.

The going concern assessment has been made by the directors based upon the cash management strategy, forward
planning and ability to raise funds from existing shareholders in the future to support the growth year on year in student

volumes.

Future developments

The Group continues to grow its core 16-19 year olds funding contract through a gradual widening of its curriculum offer,
geographical spread of its delivery footprint and, as a consequence, increasing the number of 16-19 year old learners that
are attracted to its provision.

Alongside this, the business continues to invest in its future, investing significantly in its Professional Services division
(Apprenticeships), and with the recent successful procurement of Adult Education provision with the development within
Higher Education offering real career pathways with the purpose of continually improving its service offering to learners,
employers and stakeholders.

At the date of signing the financial statements the Group continues to grow its financial strength and has invested in 2
Senior Appointments to support the business plan with the recent recruitment of a Chief Financial Officer and Chief
Operating Officer. A successful procurement under the Adult Education Budget has led to an acquisition in the year ended
31 July 2024 specialising in delivering high quality support to adult learners with a further acquisition made in the same

year to support the 16-19 contract within performing arts. Both acquisitions will support the strategic plan for growth in
these areas. The business is on track with its financial forecast for the current financial year.

Key performance indicators

The key financial and other performance indicators during the year were as follows:

2024 2023
£27,842,713 £22,362,865

£1,029,708 £514,427

As a result of revenue increases and continued support of funders the business grew by 25% in the year due to increases
within the College contract funding and the growth in Adult Skills Fund and Apprenticeships. Soccer Coaching Limited
revenue fell slightly on the prior year

Shareholder funds decreased within the year due to dividends declared and paid.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF SCL
EDUCATION & TRAINING LIMITED

Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of SCL Education & Training Limited (the ‘parent Company’) and its subsidiaries
(the 'Group') for the year ended 31 July 2024, which comprise the Consolidated Statement of income and Retained
Earnings, the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, the Company Statement of Financial Position, the
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, the Company Statement of
Changes in Equity and the related notes, including a summary of significant accounting policies. The financial reporting
framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards,
including Financial Reporting Standard 102 ‘The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of
treland’ (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

In our opinion the financial statements:

. give a true and fair view of the state of the Group's and of the parent Company's affairs as at 31 July 2024 and of
the Group's profit for the year then ended;
have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial
statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are
relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the United Kingdom, including the Financial Reporting Council's Ethical
Standard and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the
audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Conclusions relating to going concern

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in
the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions
that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group's or the parent Company's ability to continue as a
going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the Directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant
sections of this report.

Other Information

The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our
Auditors' Report thereon. The Directors are responsible for the other information contained within the Annual Report. Our
opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly
stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. Our responsibility is to read the other
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements
or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such
material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a
material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that
there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.

HATER THINKING

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF SCL
EDUCATION & TRAINING LIMITED (CONTINUED)

Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

. the information given in the Group Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and

° the Group Strategic Report and the Directors' Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal
requirements.

Matters on which we are required to report by exception

In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the parent Company and its environment obtained in the
course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the Group Strategic Report or the Directors’ Report.

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to
report to you if, in our opinion:

. adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have
not been received from branches not visited by us; or
e the parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or

certain disclosures of Directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or
we have not received ail the information and explanations we require for our audit.

Responsibilities of directors

As explained more fully in the Directors' Responsibilities Statement set out on page 4, the Directors are responsible for the
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal
control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material

misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group's and the parent Company's —
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going
concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent Company or to cease
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

BRIGHTER THINKING

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF SCL
EDUCATION & TRAINING LIMITED (CONTINUED)

Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an Auditors’ Report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with
ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic
decisions of users taken on the basis of these Group financial statements.

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line
with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The
extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below:

* The Group is subject to laws and regulations that directly affect the financial statements including financial reporting
legislation. We determined that the following laws and regulations were most significant including UK employment law,

health and safety, pensions legislation and tax legislation.

« We understood how the Group is complying with those legal and regulatory frameworks by, making inquiries to
management and those responsible for legal and compliance procedures. We assessed the extent of compliance with
these legal and compliance procedures as part of our procedures on the related financial statement items.

« The engagement director assessed whether the engagement team collectively had the appropriate competence and
capabilities to identify or recognise non-compliance with laws and regulations. The assessment did not identify any issues

in this area.

+ We assessed the susceptibility of the Group's financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might
occur. Audit procedures performed by the engagement team included:

+ Identifying and assessing the design effectiveness of controls management has in place to prevent and detect fraud;

+ Understanding how those charged with governance considered and addressed the potential for override of controls or
other inappropriate influence over the financial reporting process;

* Challenging assumptions and judgements made by management in its significant accounting estimates; and

Identifying and testing journal entries, in particular any journal entries posted with unusual account combinations.

The assessment did not identify any issues in this area.

Because of the inherent limitations of an audit, there is a risk that we will not detect all irregularities, including those ieading
to a material misstatement in the financial statements or non-compliance with regulation. This risk increases the more that
compliance with a law or regulation is removed from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, as
we will be less likely to become aware of instances of non-compliance. The risk is also greater regarding irregularities
occurring due to fraud rather than error, as fraud involves intentional concealment, forgery, collusion, omission or

misrepresentation.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting
Council's website at: www. frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our Auditors’ Report.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2024

2. Accounting policies (continued)

2.4

Revenue

Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and
the revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is measured as the fair value of the consideration received or
receivable, excluding discounts, rebates, value added tax and other sales taxes. The following criteria must

also be met before revenue is recognised:

Rendering of services

Revenue from a contract to provide services is recognised in the period in which the services are provided in
accordance with the stage of completion of the contract when all of the following conditions are satisfied:

. the amount of revenue can be measured reliably;

. it is probable that the Group will receive the consideration due under the contract;

° the stage of completion of the contract at the end of the reporting period can be measured reliably; and
. the costs incurred and the costs to complete the contract can be measured reliably.

Operating leases: the Group as lessee

Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Government grants
Grants are accounted under the accruals model as permitted by FRS 102.

Grants of a revenue nature are recognised in the Consolidated statement of income and retained earnings in
the same period as the related expenditure.

Pensions

Defined contribution pension pian

The Group operates a defined contribution plan for its employees. A defined contribution plan is a pension
plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. Once the contributions have been
paid the Group has no further payment obligations.

The contributions are recognised as an expense in profit or loss when they fall due. Amounts not paid are

shown in accruals as a liability in the Statement of Financial Position. The assets of the plan are held
separately from the Group in independently administered funds.

2. Accounting policies (continued)

2.8 Current and deferred taxation

The tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in profit or loss except that
a charge attributable to an item of income recognised as other comprehensive income or to an item
fecognised directly in equity is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity

respectively.

The current tax charge is calculated on the basis of tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the reporting date in the countries where the Company and the Group operate and generate

income. :

Deferred tax balances are recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed
by the reporting date, except that:

. The recognition of deferred tax assets is limited to the extent that it is probable that they will be
recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits;

. Any deferred tax balances are reversed if and when ail conditions for retaining associated tax
allowances have been met; and .

. Where they relate to timing differences in respect of interests in subsidiaries, associates, branches and

joint ventures and the Group can control the reversal of the timing differences and such reversal is not
considered probable in the foreseeable future.

Deferred tax balances are not recognised in respect of permanent differences except in respect of business
combinations, when deferred tax is recognised on the differences between the fair values of assets acquired
and the future tax deductions available for them and the differences between the fair values of liabilities
acquired and the amount that will be assessed for tax. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.

Intangibie assets

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the difference between amounts paid on a business combination and the acquirers
interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquiree at the date of acquisition.
Subsequent to initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and
accumulated impairment tosses. Goodwill is amortised on a straight-line basis to the Consolidated statement
of income and retained eamings over its useful economic fife, which is considered to be 10 years.

Other intangible assets

{ntangible assets are initially recognised at cost. After recognition, under the cost model, intangible assets are
measured at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.

All intangible assets are considered to Have a finite useful life. If a reliable estimate of the useful life cannot be
made, the useful life shall not exceed ten years.

The estimated useful lives range as follows:

Software development - 4 years
Business information and IP - 10 ‘years
Computer software - 3 years

Software development costs relate to the development of a new management information system which the
directors believe that once complete this system will have a useful economic life of at least 3 years.

Accounting policies (continued)

2.10 Tangible fixed assets

2.41

2.12

2.13

Tangible fixed assets under the cost model are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any
accumulated impairment losses. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to bringing the
asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by
management.

Depreciation is charged so as to allocate the cost of assets less their residual value over their estimated useful
lives, using the straight-line method.

Depreciation is provided on the following basis:

Fixtures and fittings - 25% straight line
Computer equipment - 33% straight line

The assets' residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted prospectively if
appropriate, or if there is an indication of a significant change since the last reporting date.

Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are
recognised in profit or loss. .

Valuation of investments

Investments in subsidiaries are measured at cost less accumulated impairment.

Financial instruments

The Group has elected to apply the provisions of Section 11 “Basic Financial instruments’ of FRS 102 to all of
its financial instruments.

Basic financial assets

Basic financial assets, which include trade and other receivables, cash and bank balances, are initially
measured at their transaction price including transaction costs and are subsequently carried at their amortised
cost using the effective interest method, less any provision for impairment, unless the arrangement constitutes
a financing transaction, where the transaction is measured at the present value of the future receipts
discounted at a market rate of interest.

Discounting is omitted where the effect of discounting is immaterial. The Group's cash and cash equivalents,
trade and most other receivables due with the operating cycle fall into this category of financial instruments.

Dividends

Equity dividends are recognised when they become legally payable. Interim equity dividends are recognised
when paid. Final equity dividends are recognised when approved by the shareholders at an annual general

meeting.

Judgements in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty

The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions
that affect the amounts reported. These estimates and judgements are continually reviewed and are based on
experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonabie under the

circumstances. :
Significant judgements

The group did not make any significant judgements (apart from those involving estimations which are detailed
below) that have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.

Key sources of estimation uncertainty

Accounting estimates and assumptions are made concerning the future and, by their nature, will rarely equal the
related actual outcome. The key assumptions and other sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant
tisk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year

are as follows:

Due to the nature of contract timescales it is routinely necessary to estimate contract costs for contracts that are in
progress at the year end.

There were no other key sources of estimation uncertainty.

Turnover

Share-based payments

The Group has a share option scheme for selected directors of the Group. Options are only exercisable in the event
of a successful exit event.

Options are exercisable at a price equal to the estimated fair value of the Company's shares on the date of grant.
The vesting period is 10 years. If the option remains unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant,
the options expire. Options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.

The fair value of the share based payments has been estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model due
to its relevance to UK shares and its known variables with reference to the terms and conditions upon which the
options were granted. The inputs used in the estimate of the fair values at the grant date are set out below.

Weighted Weighted

Forfeited during the year - 243.51 (238)

Outstanding at the end of the year 226.91 595° 226.91 595

The Group has based the expected volatility figure on implied volatilities of companies in similar sectors and other
publically available information for indices where similar companies are publically traded. Risk free rate is based
upon the Bank of England base rate at the time of grant.

Since there is a successful exit event planned, the Group recognised totai expenses of Enil in 2024 (2023 -
£13,468) related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions in the year.
