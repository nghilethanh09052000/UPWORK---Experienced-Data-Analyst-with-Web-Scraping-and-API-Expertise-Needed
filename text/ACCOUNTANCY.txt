Accounting policies

Company information
Accountancy Learning Ltd is a private company limited by shares incorporated in England and Wales. The
registered office is Southernhay Lodge, Barnfield Crescent, Exeter, EX1 1QT.

Accounting convention

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 102 “The Financial Reporting Standard
applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland” (“FRS 102”) and the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 as
applicable to companies subject to the small companies regime. The disclosure requirements of section 1A of
FRS 102 have been applied other than where additional disclosure is required to show a true and fair view.

The financial statements are prepared in sterling, which is the functional currency of the company. Monetary a
mounts in these financial statements are rounded to the nearest £.

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention. The principal accounting
policies adopted are set out below.

Turnover

Turnover is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for services provided in the
normal course of business, and is shown net of VAT and other sales related taxes.

Revenue from contracts for the provision of professional services is recognised by reference to the stage of
completion when the stage of completion, costs incurred and costs to complete can be estimated reliably. The
stage of completion is calculated by comparing costs incurred, mainly in relation to contractual hourly staff
rates and materials, as a proportion of total costs. Where the outcome cannot be estimated reliably, revenue is
recognised only to the extent of the expenses recognised that it is probable will be recovered.

Intangible fixed assets other than goodwill

Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are recognised at cost and are subsequently measured at
cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.

Intangible assets acquired on business combinations are recognised separately from goodwill at the acquisition
date where it is probable that the expected future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow
to the entity and the fair value of the asset can be measured reliably; the intangible asset arises from
contractual or other legal rights; and the intangible asset is separable from the entity.

Amortisation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over their
useful lives on the following bases:

Software 33% straight line

Accounting policies (Continued)

Tangible fixed assets

Tangible fixed assets are initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost or valuation, net of
depreciation and any impairment losses.

Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over their
useful lives on the following bases:

Fixtures and fittings 20% reducing balance
Computers 33% straight line

The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the sale proceeds
and the carrying value of the asset, and is credited or charged to profit or loss.

Financial instruments

The company has elected to apply the provisions of Section 11 ‘Basic Financial Instruments’ and Section 12
‘Other Financial Instruments Issues’ of FRS 102 to all of its financial instruments.

Financial instruments are recognised in the company's balance sheet when the company becomes party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument.

Financial assets and liabilities are offset, with the net amounts presented in the financial statements, when
there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net
basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Basic financial instruments are initially measured at transaction price including transaction costs and are
subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method unless the arrangement constitutes
a financing transaction, where the transaction is measured at the present value of the future receipts/payments
discounted at a market rate of interest. Financial instruments classified as receivable or payable within one year
are not amortised.

Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.

Current tax

The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as
reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or
deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The company’s
liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the
reporting end date.

Accounting policies (Continued)

Deferred tax

Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all timing differences and deferred tax assets are recognised
to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or
other future taxable profits. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the timing difference arises from
goodwill or from the initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax
profit nor the accounting profit.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting end date and reduced to the extent
that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be
recovered. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability
is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it
relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the company has a legally enforceable right to offset current
tax assets and liabilities and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax
authority.

Retirement benefits
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.

Employees

The average monthly number of persons (including directors) employed by the company during the year was:
