Notes to the Financial Statements
1.
General Information
Sccu Ltd
is a private company, limited by shares, incorporated in England & Wales, registered number
07150887
. The registered office is 7 Orchard Court Harry Weston Road, Binley, Coventry, CV3 2TQ.
2.
Accounting Policies
2.1.
Basis of Preparation of Financial Statements
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102 section 1A Small Entities "The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland" and the Companies Act 2006.
2.2.
Turnover
Turnover is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of discounts and value added taxes. Turnover includes revenue earned from the sale of goods and from the rendering of services. Turnover is reduced for estimated customer returns, rebates and other similar allowances.
Sale of goods
Turnover from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods has transferred to the buyer. This is usually at the point that the customer has signed for the delivery of the goods.
Rendering of services
Turnover from the rendering of services is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract. The stage of completion of a contract is measured by comparing the costs incurred for work performed to date to the total estimated contract costs. Turnover is only recognised to the extent of recoverable expenses when the outcome of a contract cannot be estimated reliably.
2.3.
Tangible Fixed Assets and Depreciation
Tangible fixed assets are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost of the fixed assets, less their estimated residual value, over their expected useful lives on the following bases:
Freehold
over 50 years
Leasehold
over the lease term
Plant & Machinery
over 5 years
Motor Vehicles
over 5 years
2.4.
Taxation
Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the statement of comprehensive income because of items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and items that are never taxable or deductible. The company's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.

2.4.
Taxation - continued
Deferred tax is recognised on timing differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable timing differences. Deferred tax assets are generally recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible timing differences can be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. Deferred tax liabilities are presented within provisions for liabilities and deferred tax assets within debtors. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflect the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Company expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.
Current or deferred tax for the year is recognised in profit or loss, except when they related to items that are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.
