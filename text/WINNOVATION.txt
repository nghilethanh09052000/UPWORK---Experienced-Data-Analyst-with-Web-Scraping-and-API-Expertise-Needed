Notes to the Financial Statements

Year ended 31 March 2024

1 GENERAL INFORMATION

The company is a private company limited by shares and is registered in England and Wales. The address of
the registered office is Old Flowserve Building, Shields Road, Byker, Tyne And Wear, NE6 2YP, England.

2 STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE

These financial statements have been prepared in compliance with FRS 102 Section 1A, ‘The Financial

Reporting Standard applicable to the UK and Republic of Ireland’.

3 ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF PREPARATION

The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, as modified by the revaluation of

certain assets.

The financial statements are prepared in sterling, which is the functional currency of the company.

TURNOVER

Turnover is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods supplied, net of

discounts and Value Added Tax.

Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have
transferred to the buyer, usually on despatch of the goods; the amount of revenue can be measured reliably;
it is probable that the associated economic benefits will flow to the entity; and the costs incurred or to be

incurred in respect of the transactions can be measured reliably.

CURRENT TAX

Current tax is recognised on taxable profit for the current and past periods. Current tax is measured at the
amounts of tax expected to pay or recover using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or

substantively enacted at the reporting date.

TANGIBLE ASSETS

Tangible assets are initially measured at cost, and are subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated

depreciation and accumulated impairment losses or at a revalued amount.

Any tangible assets carried at a revalued amount are recorded at the fair value at the date of revaluation less

any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses.

An increase in the carrying amount of an asset as a result of a revaluation is recognised in other
comprehensive income and accumulated in capital and reserves. However, the increase is recognised in
profit or loss to the extent that it reverses a revaluation decrease of the same asset previously recognised in
profit or loss. A decrease in the carrying amount of an asset as a result of revaluation is recognised in other
comprehensive income to the extent of any previously recognised revaluation increase accumulated in capital
and reserves. If a revaluation decrease exceeds the accumulated revaluation gains accumulated in capital

and reserves in respect of that asset, the excess is recognised in profit or loss.

Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of an asset, less its estimated residual value, over the

useful economic life of that asset as follows:

Office equipment 25% straight line
Fixtures, fittings and equipment 25% straight line
IMPAIRMENT

A review for indicators of impairment is carried out at each reporting date, with the recoverable amount being
estimated where such indicators exist. Where the carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount, the asset
is impaired accordingly. Prior impairments are also reviewed for possible reversal at each reporting date.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

A financial asset or a financial liability is recognised only when the entity becomes a party to the contractual

provisions of the instrument.

Basic financial instruments are initially recognised at the transaction price and are subsequently measured as
follows: Debt instruments are subsequently measured at amortised cost and commitments to receive a loan
and to make a loan to another entity are subsequently measured at amortised cost. Where investments in
non-convertible preference shares and non-puttable ordinary shares or preference shares are publicly traded
or their fair value can otherwise be measured reliably, the investment is subsequently measured at fair value
with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss. All other such investments are subsequently measured

at cost less impairment.

All other financial instruments, including derivatives, are initially recognised at fair value, which is normally the

transaction price and are subsequently measured at fair value, with any changes recognised in profit or loss.

Financial assets that are measured at cost or amortised cost are reviewed for objective evidence of
impairment at the end of each reporting date. If there is objective evidence of impairment, an impairment loss

is recognised in profit or loss immediately.

All equity instruments regardless of significance, and other financial assets that are individually significant, are

assessed individually for impairment. Other financial assets or either assessed individually or grouped on the

basis of similar credit risk characteristics.

Any reversals of impairment are recognised in profit or loss immediately, to the extent that the reversal does
not result in a carrying amount of the financial asset that exceeds what the carrying amount would have been
had the impairment not previously been recognised.

DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PENSION PLAN

Contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as an expense in the period in which the related
service is provided. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that the prepayment will

lead to a reduction in future payments or a cash refund.

4 AVERAGE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES

The average number of persons employed by the company during the year was 18 (2023: 16.00).

5 TANGIBLE ASSETS
