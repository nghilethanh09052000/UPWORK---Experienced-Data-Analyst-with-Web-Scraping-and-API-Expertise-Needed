Notes to the Accounts
for the year ended 31 October 2024

1 Accounting policies

Basis of preparation

The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with
FRS 102, The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland.

Turnover

Turnover is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of
discounts and value added taxes.

Intangible fixed assets

Intangible fixed assets are measured at cost less accumulative amortisation and any
accumulative impairment losses.

Tangible fixed assets

Tangible fixed assets are measured at cost less accumulative depreciation and any
accumulative impairment losses. Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets, other
than freehold land, at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of
each asset evenly over its expected useful life, as follows:

Plant and machinery 3 years straight line

Taxation

A current tax liability is recognised for the tax payable on the taxable profit of the current and
past periods.

Leased assets

A lease is classified as a finance lease if it transfers substantially all the risks and rewards
incidental to ownership. All other leases are classified as operating leases. The rights of use
and obligations under finance leases are initially recognised as assets and liabilities at amounts
equal to the fair value of the leased assets or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease
payments. Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the
reduction in the outstanding liability using the effective interest rate method. The finance
charge is allocated to each period during the lease so as to produce a constant periodic rate of
interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Leased assets are depreciated in accordance
with the company's policy for tangible fixed assets. If there is no reasonable certainty that
ownership will be obtained at the end of the lease term, the asset is depreciated over the lower
of the lease term and its useful life. Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense
on a straight line basis over the lease term.

Pensions

Contributions to defined contribution plans are expensed in the period to which they relate.
