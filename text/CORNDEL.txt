STRATEGIC REPORT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023

Introduction and principal activity

Corndel is a unique, multi-award-winning UK management and technology training provider. At our heart,
Corndel exists to provide brilliant, people-based training. This disruptive focus on training brilliance, with
one-to-one coaching from commercial experts at its heart, has made us the go-to provider for large
multinational clients focused on quality. Corndel is one of the Uk's largest providers of data analytics and
management apprenticeship programmes. We use the Apprenticeship Levy to deliver this high-quality
training with no further cost to customers.

Business review

The business continues to perform strongly with revenue at £37.4m, up 25.4% on last year. This has been
achieved by continuing to build strong relationships with large corporates and providing tailored
programmes to meet their digital and management training needs. We have won several awards for our
training provision and growth.

This led to the following improvement in KPIs for the underlying Corndel business:

2023 2022 Change
Turnover , £37.4m £29.8m 25.4%
Net profit £5.6m £3.4m 66.4%
Learner numbers (000s) 5.5 41 33.2%

Our continued investment in sales and marketing has delivered growth in the business together with the
launch of a number of new business initiatives. During 2023 we continued with some restructuring activities
to assist future growth.

Principal risks and uncertainties

The Company's approach to risk management involves regularly identifying and reviewing material risks
within our Senior Leadership Team. These are presented for consideration and approval at board level. This
section highlights some of the key risks and uncertainties which affect the Company and how they are
mitigated. :

Strategic & Economic Risks

We are experiencing inflationary pressure relating to staff pay, staff retention, utility and supplier costs. With
the support of employers, we are working with government and trade bodies to uplift the funding rate for
our core government backed funding programmes. On 31 July 2024 we received notification that two of our
programmes would receive an uplift to their funding which will help to mitigate the inflationary cost
pressures experienced.

In July 2024 the UK elected a new government and there is potential for policy change with the levy. The

Group continues to monitor developments and believes that we are in a good position if any change does
occur,

STRATEGIC REPORT (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023

Financial Risks

The Company's financial instruments comprise of cash and cash equivalents and items such as trade
creditors and trade debtors which arise directly from its operations. The main purpose of these financial
instruments is to provide finance for the Company's operations.

The Company's operations expose it to a variety of financial risks including credit risk, liquidity risk, and
foreign currency exchange rate risk. The policies set by the board of directors are implemented by the
Company's finance department.

Credit risk
The Company's credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade debtors. The vast majority of this relates to UK
government backed debtors. The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit
exposure.

Liquidity risk

The Company has no external debt. It monitors its levels of working capital to ensure that it can meet
operational obligations as they fall due. The Company's financial liabilities (none of which are derivative
financial liabilities) comprise trade creditors. The trade creditors are all payable within twelve months.

Foreign currency exchange rate risk
The Company is exposed to an immaterial foreign currency exchange rate risk as a result of trade creditors
which will be settled in dollars. Accordingly, it does not hedge any of its trading activities.

Operational Risks

Significant cyber security breach or outage
The Company has invested in secure IT platforms and obtained IT security accreditation, meeting the
stringent requirements set by major investment banks as a prerequisite for delivering training to them.
Additionally, the Company has achieved and maintains Cyber Essentials and Cyber Essentials Plus
accreditation, which is renewed annually.

Recruitment and retention of key employees

The Company attracts and retains staff through a positive. hyperflexible, people led working environment:
the majority of our staff are home-based, with a large portion working part-time to facilitate other life
commitments. Remuneration packages include longer term incentives aligning personal success to that of
the business.

Regulatory risks :
Internal processes and policies are designed to meet regulatory requirements, including a dedicated team
focused on ESFA and Ofsted best practice, data protection, whistleblowing, safeguarding and other policies.

This report was approved by the board and signed on its behalf.

DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES STATEMENT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023

The directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic Report, the Directors’ Report and the financial
statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.

Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law
the directors have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and United
Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice), including
Financial Reporting Standard 102 ‘The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of
ireland’. Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of
the Company for that period.

In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:

. select suitable accounting policies for the Company's financial statements and then apply them
consistently:

make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent:
state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material
departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and

prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that
the Company will continue in business.

The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and
explain the Company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position
of the Company and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act
2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF CORNDEL LIMITED

Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of Corndel Limited (the ‘Company’') for the year ended 31
December 2023 which comprise the Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Balance Sheet, the
Statement of Changes in Equity, the Statement of Cash Flows, the Analysis of Net Debt and the notes to the
financial statements, including significant accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that has
been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including
FRS 102 “The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland” (United Kingdom
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

In our opinion, the financial statements:

e give a true and fair view of the state of the Company's affairs as at 31 December 2023 and of its profit
for the year then ended;

. have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice; and

. have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK) and
applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's
responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the
Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial
statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Conclusions relating to going concern
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of
accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events
or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to
continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are
authorised for issue.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in
the relevant sections of this report.

Other information

The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report and Financial Statements,
other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. The directors are responsible for the
other information contained within the Annual Report and Financial Statements. Our opinion on the financial
statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our
report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. Our responsibility is to read the other
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the
financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit or otherwise appears to be
materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are
required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements
themselves. If. based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of
this other information, we are required to report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.

Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

° the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which
the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and

. the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable
legal requirements.

Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Company and its environment obtained in the course
of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic Report or the Directors’ Report.

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006
requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
. adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been
received from branches not visited by us; or
the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

Responsibilities of directors

As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 5, the directors are
responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and
fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of
financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

in preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Company's ability to
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going
concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Company or to cease
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

CORNDEL LIMITED

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF CORNDEL LIMITED

Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are
free from material misstatement. whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes
our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit
conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate,
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these
financial statements.

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design
procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of
irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities,
including fraud is detailed below:

We obtained a general understanding of the Company's legal and regulatory framework through enquiry of
management concerning their understanding of relevant laws and regulations, the entity's policies and
procedures regarding compliance, and how they identify, evaluate and account for litigation claims. We also
drew on our existing understanding of the Company's industry and regulation.

We understand that the Company comply with the framework through:

e The directors’ close involvement in the day-to-day running of the business, meaning that any litigation
or claims would come to their attention directly:
Having dedicated teams responsible for monitoring any developments; and
Subscribing to relevant updates from external experts, and making changes to internal procedures and
controls as necessary.

In the context of the audit, we considered those laws and regulations which determine the form and content

of the financial statements and which are central to the Company's ability to conduct its business and where

failure to comply could result in material penalties. We identified the following laws and regulations as

being of significance in the context of the Company:

* The Companies Act 2006 and FRS 102 in respect of the preparation and presentation of the financial
statements.

« Ofsted, and results of inspections, in respect of delivering high quality teaching and courses which is
fundamental in the entity's ability to continue as a going concern.

e Compliance with the Education & Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) rules and requirements in respect of the
funding that is received.

We performed the following specific procedures to gain evidence about compliance with the significant

laws and regulations identified above:

¢ We enauired with the Company's management as to the existence of litigation and no material items
were identified;

« We obtained written management representations regarding disclosure of any non-compliance with
laws and regulations;

e We reviewed board minutes of the Company to identify if there were any litigation or claims being
discussed that had not been disclosed to us by management.

e We reviewed relevant correspondence with Ofsted and the ESFA.

The senior statutory auditor led a discussion with senior members of the engagement team regarding the
susceptibility of the entity's financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur.
The key area identified in this discussion was the manipulation of the financial statements through manual
journal entries and incorrect recognition of revenue.

Page 9

CORNDEL LIMITED

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF CORNDEL LIMITED

The procedures we carried out to gain evidence in the above area included:

e Testing journal entries, selected based on specific risk assessments applied based on the Company's
processes and controls surrounding manual journals.

« Testing of revenue transactions to underlying documentation.

The senior statutory auditor was satisfied that the engagement team collectively had the appropriate
competence and capabilities to identify or recognise irregularities.

A further description of our responsibilities is available on the Financial Reporting Council's website at:
www. frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor's report.

Use of our report

This report is made solely to the Company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of
the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company's
members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To
the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the
Company and the Company's members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we
have formed.

Accounting policies

Basis of preparation of financial statements

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention unless
otherwise specified within these accounting policies and in accordance with Financial Reporting
Standard 102, the Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and the Republic of Ireland
and the Companies Act 2006.

The preparation of financial statements in compliance with FRS 102 requires the use of certain
critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise judgement in applying the
Company's accounting policies (see note 3).

The following principal accounting policies have been applied:
Going concern

As at 31 December 2023, the Company had net current assets of £3.715,348 and generated
EBITDA in the 12 months to 31 December 2023 of £6.979,535. As at 31 December 2023 and at the
signing of these financial statements, the Company has no external debt, it had a cash balance of
£3,847,726 as at 31 December 2023 and is not reliant upon the financial support of third parties.
Forecasts prepared by management show the Company is expected to remain cash generative
and to generate positive EBITDA for the foreseeable future being a period of at least 12 months
from the signing of these financial statements. The Company has demonstrated its resilience
through Covid, increasing profits, and has the ability to modify its cost base if required. For this
reason, the directors have prepared the financial statements on a going concern basis.

Foreign currency translation

Functional and presentation currency

The Company's functional and presentational currency is GBP.
Transactions and balances

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the spot
exchange rates at the dates of the transactions.

At each period end foreign currency monetary items are translated using the closing rate. Non-
monetary items measured at historical cost are transtated using the exchange rate at the date of
the transaction and non-monetary items measured at fair value are measured using the
exchange rate when fair value was determined.

Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of transactions and from the

translation at period-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in
foreign currencies are recognised in profit or loss.

2. Accounting policies (continued)
2.4 Turnover

Turnover is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the
Company and the turnover can be reliably measured. Turnover is measured as the fair value of
the consideration received or receivable, excluding discounts, rebates, value added tax and
other sales taxes. The following criteria must also be met before turnover is recognised:

Rendering of services

Turnover from a contract to provide services is recognised in the period in which the services are
provided in accordance with the stage of completion of the contract when all of the following
conditions are satisfied:

. the amount of turnover can be measured reliably:
. it is probable that the Company will receive the consideration due under the contract;

. the stage of completion of the contract at the end of the reporting period can be
measured reliably; and

. the costs incurred and the costs to complete the contract can be measured reliably.
25 Operating leases: the Company as lessee

Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the
lease term.

Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to sign an operating lease are recognised on a
straight-line basis over the lease term, unless another systematic basis is representative of the
time pattern of the lessee’s benefit from the use of the leased asset.

26 Interest income

Interest income is recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method.

Intangibte assets
Goodwill

Goodwill represents the difference between amounts paid on the cost of a business combination
and the acquirer's interest in the fair value of its identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquiree
at the date of acquisition. Subsequent to initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less
accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is amortised on a
straight line basis to the Statement of Comprehensive Income over its useful economic life of 5
years.

Other intangible assets

Intangible assets are initially recognised at cost. After recognition, under the cost model,
intangible assets are measured at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated
impairment losses.

Internally and externally generated content is capitalised as intangible fixed assets as it is an
identifiable non-monetary asset without physical substance whose costs can be reliably
estimated. and it is probable that future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will
flow to the Company.

Internally and externally generated content is amortised over five years using the straight-line
basis. The directors have estimated the five year useful life of the intangible assets. being
educational content.

impairment of intangible assets

Intangible assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each reporting date. If there is
objective evidence of impairment, an impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss.

Tangible fixed assets

Tangible fixed assets under the cost model are stated at historical cost less accumulated
depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Historical cost includes expenditure that is
directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be
capable of operating in the manner intended by management.

Depreciation is charged so as to allocate the cost of assets less their residual value over their
estimated useful lives, as follows.

Depreciation is provided on the following basis:

Computer equipment - straight-line over 2 years
The assets’ residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted
prospectively if appropriate, or if there is an indication of a significant change since the last
reporting date.

Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying
amount and are recognised in profit or loss.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023

2. Accounting policies (continued)
2.10 Pensions
Defined contribution pension plan

The Company operates a defined contribution plan for its employees. A defined contribution plan
is a pension plan under which the Company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. Once
the contributions have been paid the Company has no further payment obligations.

The contributions are recognised as an expense in profit or loss when they fall due. Amounts not
paid are shown in accruals as a liability in the Balance Sheet. The assets of the plan are held
separately from the Company in independently administered funds.

2.11 Employment benefits

Short-term employee benefits including holiday pay and annual bonuses are accrued as services
are rendered.

2.12 Provisions for liabilities

Provisions are made where an event has taken place that gives the Company a legal or
constructive obligation that probably requires settlement by a transfer of economic benefit, and
a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.

Provisions are charged as an expense to profit or loss in the year that the Company becomes
aware of the obligation, and are measured at the best estimate at the balance sheet date of the
expenditure required to settle the obligation, taking into account relevant risks and uncertainties.

When payments are eventually made, they are charged to the provision carried in the Balance
Sheet.

2.13 Financial instruments

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Balance Sheet when the Company
becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

Trade and other debtors and creditors are classified as basic financial instruments and measured
at initial recognition at transaction price. A provision is established when there is objective
evidence that the Company will not be able to collect all amounts due.

Cash and cash equivalents are classified as basic financial instruments and comprise cash in
hand and at bank, short-term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less and
bank overdrafts which are an integral part of the Company's cash management.

Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Company are classified in accordance
with the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into and the definitions of a financial
liability and an equity instrument. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual
interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments
issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023

2. Accounting policies (continued)
2.13 Financial instruments (continued)

Interest bearing bank loans, overdrafts and other loans which meet the criteria to be classified as
basic financial instruments are initially recorded at the present value of cash payable to the bank,
which is ordinarily equal to the proceeds received net of direct issue costs. These liabilities are
subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.

2.14 Current and deferred taxation

The tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in profit or
loss except that a charge attributable to an item of income and expense recognised as other
comprehensive income or to an item recognised directly in equity is also recognised in other
comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.

The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of tax rates and laws that have been
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date in the countries where the Company
operates and generates income.

Deferred tax balances are recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but
not reversed by the balance sheet date, except that:

e The recognition of deferred tax assets is limited to the extent that it is probable that they
will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable
profits; and

. Any deferred tax balances are reversed if and when all conditions for retaining associated
tax allowances have been met.

Deferred tax balances are not recognised in respect of permanent differences except in respect
of business combinations, when deferred tax is recognised on the differences between the fair
values of assets acquired and the future tax deductions available for them and the differences
between the fair values of liabilities acquired and the amount that will be assessed for tax.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the balance sheet date.

2.15 Dividends
Equity dividends are recognised when they become legally payable. Interim equity dividends are

recognised when paid. Final equity dividends are recognised when approved by the
shareholders at an annual general meeting.

Accounting policies (continued)
2.16 Business Combinations

Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date,
which is the date on which control is transferred to the Company.

The cost of a business combination is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities
incurred and the equity interests issued by the Company in exchange for control and the costs
directly attributable to the business combination.

The consideration transferred includes the estimate of any asset or liability resulting from a
contingent consideration arrangement where the transfer of further consideration is probable
and can be measured reliably. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities
assumed in the business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition
date. Contingent liabilities are only recognised where the fair value can be measured reliably.

Judgements in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting practice
requires management to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.

The directors consider that the following judgements have had the most significant effect on amounts
recognised in the financial statements:

Financial instrument classification:

The classification of financial instruments as “basic” or “other” requires judgement as to whether all
applicable conditions for classification as basic are met. This includes consideration of the form of the
instrument and its return.

The directors consider that the key sources of estimation uncertainty in preparing the financial
statements are:

Recoverability of debtors and sales provisions:

The net trade debtors balance is £4,377,178 (2022 - £2,912,269) recorded in the Company's Balance
Sheet. A full line by line review of trade debtors is carried out at the end of each month. A sales
provision of £313,856 (2022 - £301,308) has been set off against trade debtors to reflect the estimated
number of subsequent credits, these being represented by the Company's learners dropping out of
courses prior to the year end. The total provision is based on actual data received regarding drop outs
together with an estimate on past experience of learner drop out figures.

Business combination: Contingent consideration and purchase price allocation

On 1 September 2023 the Company acquired proprietary content and operations relating to Software
Developer and DevOps Engineer Apprenticeships. from its existing delivery partner, Softwire, as part
of a business combination. Consideration paid included an initial cash payment of £1.846m and further
deferred contingent consideration amounts, with an estimated fair value of £1.832m, based on 1,001
new learners forecast to the join the content courses, over the relevant assessment period. Should
the forecasts change, the deferred contingent consideration amount will also change accordingly.
The deferred contingent consideration has a present value of £1.049m based on the relevant
weighted average rate, estimated to be 19.6%.
