Review of the business
The principal activity of the Company is that of a training provider. There have not been any significant changes in the Company's
principal activities in the year under review.

was £71,000 (2023: £44,000 loss). Following the acquisition of the Company by the Group in 2022, the business has grown through
maintaining its existing customer base together with increasing activity with other businesses owned by the Group in the
Telecommunications industry. This is reflected in improved revenue, profitability and net assets.

of the Directors listed above in respect of liabilities incurred as a result of their office to the extent permitted by law.

Dividends
There were no dividends payable during the year (2023: £nil).

Financial risk management
The Company does not enter into any hedging instruments or any financial instruments for speculative purposes.

Appropriate trade terms are negotiated with suppliers and customers. Management reviews these terms and the relationships
with suppliers and customers and manages any exposure on normal trade terms. The Company's requirement for additional

Notes to the financial statements
1 Accounting policies, judgements and estimates

a) General information

8Point8 Training Limited (the "Company") is a private company limited by shares and is incorporated and domiciled in the United
Kingdom. Details of the Company's activities are set out in the Directors‘ report. The Company’s financial statements are presented
in pounds sterling, which is the Company’s functional and presentational currency. All amounts have been rounded to the nearest
thousand pounds, unless otherwise indicated.

b) Statement of compliance with FRS 102
These financial statements were prepared in accordance with FRS 102 The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and
Republic of treland and the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

¢) Basis of preparation

Going concern

The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The Company participates in the centralised treasury
arrangements and shared banking arrangements of Mitie Group plc, its ultimate parent, and of its fellow subsidiaries (together
the "Group”}. The directors of Mitie Group pic have confirmed the provision of adequate financial resources to the Company for
a period of not less than 12 months from the date of approval of the Company’s statutory financial statements for the year ended
31 March 2024 to ensure that the Company can meet its liabilities as they falt due.

The directors of Mitie Group plc have carried out an assessment of the Group's ability to continue as a going concern for the
period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of these financial statements (the “Going Concern Assessment Period”).
This assessment was based on the latest medium-term cash forecasts from the Group’s cash flow model (the “Base Case
Forecasts”), which is based on the Group’s board approved budget. These Base Case Forecasts indicate that the debt facilities
currently in place are adequate to support the Group over the Going Concern Assessment Period.

The Group's principal debt financing arrangements as at 30 September 2024 were a £250m revolving credit facility, which was
undrawn as at 30 September 2024, and £150m of US private placement (“USPP”} notes. These financing arrangements are subject
to certain financial covenants which are tested every six months ona rolling 12-month basis.

The revolving credit facility was putin place in October 2021, and matures in October 2027, on significantly more favourable terms
than the previous facility. In September 2023, the Group increased the existing revolving credit facility from £150m to £250m and
its maturity date was extended for one year to October 2027. In October 2024 the maturity date was extended for one further
year such that the facility now matures in October 2028.

Of the USPP notes, £120m were issued in December 2022 under a delayed funding agreement to avoid any overlap with the
£121.5m (being the repayment amount after taking account of the cross-currency interest rate swaps) of notes that matured in
the same month. The USPP notes are split equally between 8, 10 and 12 year maturities, and were issued with an average coupon
of 2.94% that is significantly below the coupon of the maturing notes. The Base Case Forecasts assume that the remaining £30m
of USPP notes, which are due to mature in December 2024, will not be replaced.

The Group currently operates within the terms of its agreements with its lenders, with consolidated net cash (i.e. net cash adjusted
for covenant purposes, primarily by the exclusion of lease liabilities) of £5.0m as at 30 September 2024. The Base Case Forecasts
indicate that the Group will continue to operate within these terms and that the headroom provided by the Group’s debt facilities
currently in place is adequate to support the Group over the Going Concern Assessment Period.

The directors of Mitie Group plc have also completed a reverse stress test using the Group cash flow model to assess the point at
which the financial covenants, or facility headroom, would be breached. The sensitivities considered have been chosen after
considering the Group’s principal risks and uncertainties.

Notes to the financial statements (continued)

1 Accounting poticies, judgements and estimates (continued)

The primary financial risks related to adverse changes in the economic environment and/or a deterioration in commercial or

operational conditions are listed below. These risks have been considered in the context of any further UK budgetary changes,

the continued impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, conflict within the Middle East and high inflation:

« adownturn in revenues—this reflects the risks of not being able to deliver services to existing customers, or contracts being
terminated or not renewed;

* a deterioration of gross margin—this reflects the risks of contracts being renegotiated at lower margins, or planned cost
savings not being delivered;

* an increase in costs—this reflects the risks of a shortfall in planned overhead cost savings, including margin enhancement
initiatives not being delivered, or other cost increases such as sustained higher cost inflation; and

« a downturn in cash generation—this reflects the risks of customers delaying payments due to liquidity constraints, the
removal of ancillary debt facilities or any substantial one-off settlements related to commercial issues.

As a result of completing this assessment, the directors of Mitie Group ple concluded that the likelihood of the reverse stress

scenarios arising was remote. In reaching the conclusion of remote, the directors of Mitie Group pic considered the following:

e — allstress test scenarios would require a very severe deterioration compared to the Base Case Forecasts. Revenue is considered
to be the key risk, as this is less within the control of management. Revenue would need to decline by approximately 37% in
the 12 months to 30 September 2026 compared to the Base Case Forecasts, which is considered to be very severe given the
high proportion of the Group’s revenue that is fixed in nature and the fact that even in the Covid-hit year ended 31 March
2021, the Group’s revenue excluding Interserve declined by only 1.6%; and

e inthe event that results started to trend significantly below those included in the Base Case Forecasts, additional mitigation
actions have been identified that would be implemented, which are not factored into the stress test scenarios. These include
the short-term sealing down of capital expenditure, overhead efficiency/reduction measures including cancellation of
discretionary bonuses and reduced discretionary spend, asset disposals and reductions in cash distributions and share
buybacks.

Based on these assessments, the directors of Mitie Group pic have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate
resources to continue in operational existence for a period of no less than 12 months from the date of approval of these financial
statements. In addition, the directors of Mitie Group plc have concluded that the likelinood of the reverse stress scenarios arising
is remote and therefore no material uncertainty exists.

Based on this assessment, and their enquiries of the directors of Mitie Group plc, the Directors have a reasonable expectation
that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for a period of no less than 12 months from the
date of approval of the Company's financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2024. Accordingly, the financial statements
have been prepared on a going concern basis.

FRS 102 exemptions

In these financial statements, the Company has applied the exemptions available under FRS 102 in respect of the following

disclosures:

* — acash flow statement and related notes;

° comparative period reconciliations for property, plant and equipment, and share capital:

° certain financial instruments disclosures;

e — disclosures in respect of the compensation of Key Management Personnel; and

« — disclosures in respect of related party transactions entered into between two or more members of a group, provided that
any subsidiary which is a party to the transaction is wholly owned by such a member.

Accounting standards that are newly effective in the current year
There were no new and mandatorily effective standards nor amendments in the year that would have a material impact on the
financial statements.

Notes to the financial statements (continued)

1 Accounting policies, judgements and estimates (continued)

Measurement convention
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis.

d} Significant accounting policies
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these
financial statements.

Revenue recognition

Revenue is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods and services provided in the normal
course of business, and is shown net of VAT and other sales related taxes. The fair value of consideration takes into account trade
discounts, settlement discounts and volume rebates.

When cash inflows are deferred and represent a financing arrangement, the fair value of the consideration is the present value of
the future receipts. The difference between the fair value of the consideration and the nominal amount received is recognised as
interest income.

Taxation

Taxation for the year represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to
the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. in this case tax is also recognised
in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.

Current or deferred taxation assets and liabilities are not discounted.

Current tax is the amount of income tax payable in respect of the taxable profit for the year or prior years. Tax is calculated on
the basis of tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the year end.

Deferred tax arises from timing differences that are differences between taxable profits and total comprehensive income as stated
in the financial statements. These timing differences arise from the inclusion of income and expenses in tax assessments in periods
different from those in which they are recognised in financial statements.

Deferred tax is recognised on all timing differences at the reporting date. Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are
only recognised when it is probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future
taxable profits.

Deferred tax is measured using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the year end and that are
expected to apply to the reversal of the timing difference.

Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost, net of depreciation and any
impairment losses.

Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost of assets less their residual values over their useful lives on the following

bases:
Plant and vehicles: 15% to 25% reducing balance
Training tower: 25 years

The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying
value of the asset, and is credited or charged to the income statement.

8Point8 Training Limited
Annual report and financial statements 2024

Notes to the financial statements (continued)

1 Accounting policies, judgements and estimates (continued)

Impairment of fixed assets

At each reporting date, the Company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible assets to determine whether there is any
indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset
is estimated in order to determine the extent of any impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable
amount of an individual asset, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset
belongs.

Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use. in assessing value-in-use, the estimated future
cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time
value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.

If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying
amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount.

An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.

Recognised impairment losses are reversed if, and only if, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased
to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount
that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years.
Areversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.

Financial instruments
The Company has elected to apply the provisions of Section 11 8asic Financial Instruments and Section 12 Other Financial
Instruments Issues of FRS 102 to all of its financial instruments.

Financial instruments are recognised in the Company's statement of financial position when the Company becomes party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument.

Financial assets and liabilities are offset, with the net amounts presented in the financial statements, when there is a legally
enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and
settle the liability simultaneously.

Financial assets

Basic financial assets, which include trade receivables and certain other receivables and cash and cash equivalents,
are initially measured at transaction price including transaction costs and are subsequently carried at amortised
cost using the effective interest method unless the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where the
transaction is measured at the present value of future receipts discounted at a market rate of interest. Financial
assets classified as receivable within one year are not amortised.

Financial assets, other than those held at fair value through profit and loss, are assessed for indicators of
impairment at each reporting end date. Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a
result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future
cash flows have been affected. If an asset is impaired, the impairment loss is the difference between the carrying
amount and the present value of the estimated cash flows discounted at the asset’s original effective interest rate.
The impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.

If there is a decrease in the impairment loss arising from an event occurring after the impairment was recognised,
the impairment is reversed. The reversal is such that the current carrying amount does not exceed what the
carrying amount would have been, had the impairment not previously been recognised. The impairment reversal
is recognised in the income statement.

Financial assets are derecognised when and only when (a) the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire
or are settled, (b) the Company transfers to another party substantially all of the risks and rewards of the ownership of the financial
asset, or (c) the Company, despite having retained some, but not all, significant risks and rewards of ownership, has transferred
control of the asset to another party.

1 Accounting policies, judgements and estimates (continued)

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents are basic financial assets and include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short term
liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are presented in trade
and other payables in the statement of financial position.

Classification of financial liabilities and equity instruments

Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting ail of its
liabilities.

Financial liabilities

Basic financial liabilities, including trade payables and certain other payables, are initially recognised at transaction price unless
the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where the debt instrument is measured at the present value of the future
payments discounted at a market rate of interest. Financial liabilities classified as payable within one year are not amortised.

Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from
suppliers. Amounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less. If not, they are presented
as non-current liabilities. Trade payables are recognised initially at transaction price and subsequently measured at amortised cost
using the effective interest method.

Financial liabilities are derecognised only when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires.

Retirement benefit costs
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.

e) Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty

The preparation of financial statements under FRS 102 requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions
that affect amounts recognised for assets and liabilities at the reporting date and the amounts of revenue and expenses incurred
during the reporting period. Actual results may ditter trom these judgements, estimates and assumptions.

Critical judgements in applying the Company's accounting policies
There were no critical judgements that had significant effects on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.

Key sources of estimation uncertainty
There were no key sources of estimation uncertainty at the statement of financial position date that may have a significant risk of
causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the next financial year.
