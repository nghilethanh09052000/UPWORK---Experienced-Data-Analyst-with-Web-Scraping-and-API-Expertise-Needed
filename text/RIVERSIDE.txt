Accounting policies

Company information
Riverside Training Limited is a private company limited by shares incorporated in England and Wales. The registered
office is 4-6 St Martins Street, Hereford, HR2 7RE.

Accounting convention

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 102 “The Financial Reporting Standard
applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland” (“FRS 102") and the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 as
applicable to companies subject to the small companies regime. The disclosure requirements of section 1A of FRS 102
have been applied other than where additional disclosure is required to show a true and fair view.

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, modified to include the revaluation
of freehold properties and to include investment properties and certain financial instruments at fair value. The principal
accounting policies adopted are set out below.

Turnover

Turnover is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods and services provided in
the normal course of business. The fair value of consideration takes into account trade discounts, settlement discounts
and volume rebates.

Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have
passed to the buyer (usually on dispatch of the goods), the amount of revenue can be measured reliably, it is probable
that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the entity and the costs incurred or to be incurred
in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.

Revenue from the provision of services is recognised by reference to the stage of completion, when the costs incurred
and costs to complete can be estimated reliably.

Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost or valuation, net of depreciation
and any impairment losses.

Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over their useful
lives an the follawing bases:

Fixtures and fittings 15% on cost
Computer equipment 33% on cost
Motor vehicles 25% on cost

The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the sale proceeds and the
carrying value of the asset, and is credited or charged to profit or loss.

Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.

Current tax

The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the
profit and loss account because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years
and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The company's liability for current tax is calculated
using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting end date.

Accounting policies (Continued)

Deferred tax

Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all timing differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the
extent that it is probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable
profits. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the timing difference arises from goodwill or from the initial
recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting end date and reduced to the extent that it is
no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the
assetis realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the profit and loss account, except when it relates to items
charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are offset when the company has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and the
deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority.

Employee benefits
The cost of any unused holiday entitlement is recognised in the period in which the employee's services are received.

Retirement benefits
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.

Leases
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards
of ownership to the lessees. All other leases are classified as operating leases.

Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets at the lower of the assets fair value at the date of inception
and the present value of the minimum lease payments. The related liability is included in the balance sheet as a
finance lease obligation. Lease payments are treated as consisting of capital and interest elements. The interest is
charged to profit or loss so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.

Rentals payable under operating leases, including any lease incentives received, are charged to profit or loss on a
straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease except where another more systematic basis is more
representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leases asset are consumed.

Employees

The average monthly number of persons (including directors) employed by the company during the year was:
