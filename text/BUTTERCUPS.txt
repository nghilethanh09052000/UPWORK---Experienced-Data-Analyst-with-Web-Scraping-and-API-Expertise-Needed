These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 102 “The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland” (“FRS 102”) and the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies subject to the small companies regime. The disclosure requirements of section 1A of FRS 102 have been applied other than where additional disclosure is required to show a true and fair view.

The company has taken advantage of the exemption under section 400 of the
Companies Act 2006 not to prepare consolidated accounts. The
financial statements
present information about the company as an individual entity and not about its group
.
Buttercups Training Limited is a wholly owned subsidiary of Buttercups Holdings Limited.
1.2
Turnover
Revenue from contracts for the provision of professional services is recognised by reference to the stage of completion when the stage of completion, costs incurred and costs to complete can be estimated reliably. The stage of completion is calculated by comparing costs incurred, mainly in relation to contractual hourly staff rates and materials, as a proportion of total costs.
Where the outcome cannot be estimated reliably, revenue is recognised only to the extent of the expenses recognised that are recoverable.
1.3
Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets
are initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost or valuation, net of depreciation and any impairment losses.
Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over their useful lives on the following bases:
Fixtures, fittings & equipment
25% reducing balance basis and 33% straight line basis
The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying value of the asset, and
is credited or charged to profit or loss
.

1.4
Impairment of fixed assets
At each reporting
period
end date, the
company
reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible
assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any).
1.5
Financial instruments
The company has elected to apply the provisions of Section 11 ‘Basic Financial Instruments’ and Section 12 ‘Other Financial Instruments Issues’ of FRS 102 to all of its financial instruments.
Financial instruments are recognised in the company's balance sheet when the company becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset
, with
the net amounts presented in the financial statements
,
when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Basic financial assets
Basic financial assets, which include
debtors
and cash and bank balances, are initially measured at transaction price
. Financial assets classified as receivable within one year are not amortised.
Classification of financial liabilities
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements.
Basic financial liabilities
Basic financial liabilities, including
creditors
are
initially recognised at transaction price.
Financial liabilities classified as payable within one year are not amortised.
Trade creditors
are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired
in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. A
m
ounts payable are classified as
current liabilities.
Trade creditors
are recognised initially at transaction price.
1.6
Equity instruments
Share capital issued by the company is recorded at the proceeds received, net of transaction costs. Dividends payable on share capital are recognised as liabilities once they are no longer at the discretion of the company.
1.7
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Current tax
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the
profit and loss account
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The
company’s
liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting end date.

Deferred tax
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all timing differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the timing difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
1.8
Employee benefits
The costs of short-term employee benefits are recognised as a liability and an expense, unless those costs are required to be recognised as part of the cost of stock or
fixed assets
.
The cost of any unused holiday entitlement is recognised in the period in which the employee’s services are received.
1.9
Retirement benefits
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
1.10
Leases
Rentals payable under operating leases,
including
any lease incentives received, are charged to
profit or loss
on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease except where another more systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the lease
s
asset are consumed.
1.11
Government grants
Government grants are recognised at the fair value of the asset receive
d
or receivable when there is reasonable assurance that the grant conditions will be met and the grants will be received.
A grant that specifies performance conditions is recognised in income when the performance conditions are met
.
Where a
grant does not specify performance conditions
it
is recognised in income when the proceeds are received or receivable
. A grant received before the recognition criteria are satisfied is recognised as a liability.
