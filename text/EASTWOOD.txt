Eastwood Park Limited
Strategic Report for the Year Ended 31 March 2024

The directors present their strategic report for the year ended 31 March 2024.
Principal activity

The principal activity of the company is the provision of training in specialist support services, estates and facilities
management and engineering, primarily to the healthcare sector and commercial facilities management sectors, as
well as the provision of facilities and services for conferences and social events.

Fair review of the business

During the above period the company’s turnover and gross profit margin has increased compared to the previous
period and the profit before tax and overall balance sheet remain strong.

The results are summarised on page 10 and the directors feel that in this more normal, post pandemic economic
climate, and taking into account the exceptional demolition, refurbishment, IT systems and legal and professional
costs that have been incurred during this time, that these results are good, sustainable and can be improved upon
going forward.

The nature of the company’s specialist training provision, that is associated with accreditation related to statutory
compliance in most cases, and the unique facilities, plant, equipment and expertise used in its delivery, together with
the on-site overnight accommodation continues to make our provision unique and highly attractive to clients from
throughout the UK and from overseas. As most of this training is based on the skills needed to undertake specialist
roles it has to be delivered on a face-face basis in a safe simulated work environment, such as that created at
Eastwood Park in its new training centre, rather than via remote online training or e-learning.

We have over 54 years’ experience as a specialist training provider and our Eastwood Park brand has been well
recognised and respected in the ‘industry’ over this time. As a result of this, and our current and progressive
curriculum, many existing healthcare clients return each year providing a secure base upon which to grow the
business within this sector and increasingly within our other markets as well.

The growth in our hotel services turnover is mainly as a result of increased sales in our conferencing, wedding and
social bookings. These are provided alongside our training provision and on weekends and during public holiday
periods.

Strategic Report for the Year Ended 31 March 2024

Principal risks and uncertainties

Competition — Due to the high capital costs of replicating the required training environment and the specialist skills
and accreditation required to operate in our market, competition remains very limited both in terms of other potential
providers and the restricted scope of their provision. However local hotels and other event venues do provide some
competition in respect of our wedding and social event business. However, the Grade II listed Eastwood Park Country
House is a unique venue in a stunning location and presents well to these and more commercial markets.

Employees and skills - We continue to recruit and invest more resources into the ongoing development, retention,
progression and succession of our workforce. We have made new appointments regarding Compliance, Sustainability
and Health & Safety management and strengthened our Senior Management Team, our Finance, Marketing and
Maintenance functions and the staff that deliver our training services. We are also investing more in staff development
and retention initiatives. We continue to carry a small number of permanent vacancies in our hotel services workforce
but we are gradually recruiting into these roles whilst utilising temporary staff in the interim.

Financial Management — The company has consolidated its bank borrowings which it continues to repay from its
trading income whilst meeting the bank’s covenants and maintaining sufficient cash in the business to operate it
effectively. We have previously reduced some of our borrowings from the cash held in the business generated from
the profits made and we will continue to do this to accelerate the loan repayments.

Business interruption — Due to the diversity of our ‘products’ and services, and the location of our facilities within the
estate, the company should not experience severe disruption that impacts on the entire business. During this
accounting period the company has successfully managed the potential disruption that the above-mentioned
refurbishment, fit-out and demolition work could have caused.

COVID-19 - We are no longer experiencing any significant impact from the COVID-19 pandemic and business
patterns have now returned to normal.

Eastwood Park Limited
Directors’ Report for the Year Ended 31 March 2024

The directors present their report and the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2024.
Directors of the company

The directors who held office during the year were as follows:

Mr JL Thatcher

Mrs P S Oliver

Mrs L A Willis

Ms LA Temple
Dividends

The directors recommend a final dividend payment of £Nil be made in respect of the financial year ended 31 March
2024 (2023 - ENil).

Financial instruments

The company has procedures to identify risk and manage the risks that may hinder its financial performance
objectives. The objective is to limit counterparty exposure, ensure sufficient weekly capital and to mitigate the risk
identified. The company does not consider it necessary to employ derivatives to manage risk based on the current
activities of the company.

Objectives and policies

The company operates in a select number of profitable business streams and its objectives in doing so are outlined in
the company’s Strategic Plan. The directors review the Strategic Plan annually and employ various policies, strategies
and tactics to help them achieve, or make progress towards achieving, the objectives in the plan.

Price risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow risk

The company's activities expose it to a number of financial risks

a) Price risk

The company is exposed to inflationary pressures in the general economy.

b) Credit risk

All customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures. Trade debtors are
reviewed on a regular basis and provision is made for doubtful debts when necessary.

c) Liquidity risk

The company actively manages its cash and debt finance to ensure it has sufficient funds available through the
preparation of cash and working capital forecasts.

d) Cash flow risk

The directors regularly review the cash position of the company using both short-term and long-term cash forecasts.
Cash flow can be forecast with confidence and therefore cash flow risk is considered minimal.

e) Technology risk

The company has a new state-of-the-art training centre facility with the latest equipment meaning the company will be
at the forefront of its industry for some time to come. The directors are also of the opinion that remote e-learning will
have minimal impact on the company as most of its training is based on the skills needed to undertake specialist roles
and therefore has to be delivered on a face-face basis in a safe simulated work environment.

Directors’ Report for the Year Ended 31 March 2024

Future developments

With the sustainable replacement of our heating, cooling and hot water systems in the mansion house and the fit-out
of our new state-of-the-art training centre now complete the focus for capital development will now be on determining
a revised development strategy for the site in order to ensure the long-term future of the business on the Eastwood
Park estate.

The development and updating of our training curriculum and the creation of new digital learning programmes will
continue to ensure our provision remains relevant to our current healthcare market whilst also being attractive to other
associated markets both in the UK and overseas. Our hotel services and facilities will continue to be enhanced in
order to meet our growing customer expectations and our management systems and websites will be reviewed to
ensure they continue to meet the requirements of our growing business.

Important adjusting events after the financial period
Since the year end, a previous overage agreement in respect of a land sale was renegotiated giving the company

certainty to the future cash receipt of £300,000. As a result of this renegotiation the income has been recognised in
the year.

Disclosure of information to the auditors

Each director has taken steps that they ought to have taken as a director in order to make themselves aware of any
relevant audit information and to establish that the company's auditors are aware of that information. The directors
confirm that there is no relevant information that they know of and of which they know the auditors are unaware.

Eastwood Park Limited
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities

The directors acknowledge their responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in
accordance with applicable law and regulations.

Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the
directors have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company law the directors
must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of
affairs of the company and of the profit or loss of the company for that period. In preparing these financial statements,
the directors are required to:

+ select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently;
* make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;

state whether applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material
departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and

prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the
company will continue in business.

The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the
company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and
enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible
for safeguarding the assets of the company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of
fraud and other irregularities.

Independent Auditor's Report to the Members of Eastwood Park Limited
Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of Eastwood Park Limited (the 'company') for the year ended 31 March
2024, which comprise the Profit and Loss Account, Balance Sheet, Statement of Changes in Equity, Statement of
Cash Flows, and Notes to the Financial Statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. The
financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom
Accounting Standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 102 The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the
UK and Republic of Ireland (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

In our opinion the financial statements:

give a true and fair view of the state of the company’s affairs as at 31 March 2024 and of its profit for the year
then ended;

* have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and

* have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law.
Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the auditor responsibilities for the audit of the
financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the company in accordance with the ethical
requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard,
and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the
audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Conclusions relating to going concern

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of
accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or
conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going
concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements were authorised for issue.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant
sections of this report.

Other information

The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in
the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the financial
statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we
do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing
so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge
obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or
apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the
financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we
conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.

Eastwood Park Limited

Independent Auditor's Report to the Members of Eastwood Park Limited

Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors' Report for the financial year for which the financial
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and

* the Strategic Report and Directors' Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception

In the light of our knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the course of the
audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report.

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to
you if, in our opinion:

adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from
branches not visited by us; or

+ the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
* certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or

* we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Responsibilities of directors

As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors' Responsibilities set out on page 6, the directors are responsible
for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such
internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the company's ability to continue as
a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of
accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic
alternative but to do so.

Auditor Responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with
ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and
are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

In identifying and assessing risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including fraud, the audit
engagement team:

obtained an understanding of the nature of the industry and sector, including the legal and regulatory framework
that the company operates in and how the company is complying with the legal and regulatory framework;

inquired of management, and those charged with governance, about their own identification and assessment of
the risks or irregularities, including known and actual, suspected or alleged instances of fraud;

Page 8

Eastwood Park Limited
Independent Auditor's Report to the Members of Eastwood Park Limited

discussed matters about non-compliance with laws and regulations and how fraud might occur including
assessment of how and where the financial statements may be susceptible to fraud.

undertaken a review of manual journals processed in the accounting system, applying professional scepticism to
ensure they are in line with our expectation that they are not unusual in the normal course of business.

However, it is the primary responsibility of management, with the oversight of those charged with governance, to
ensure that the entity’s operations are conducted in accordance with the provisions of laws and regulations and for the
prevention and detection of fraud.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial
Reporting Council's website at: http://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our
auditor's report.

Use of our report

This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted
by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as
a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

2 Accounting policies
Summary of significant accounting policies and key accounting estimates

The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These
policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.

Statement of compliance

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102 - 'The Financial
Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland’ and the Companies Act 2006.

Basis of preparation

These financial statements have been prepared using the historical cost convention except that as disclosed in the
accounting policies certain items are shown at fair value.

The financial statements are prepared in sterling, which is the functional currency of the company, and rounded to the
nearest £.

Going concern

The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, even though the company has net current
liabilities, as following the preparation of cash forecasts and projections management are of the opinion that the
working capital generated by the company for the foreseeable future will be sufficient to enable the company to meet
their liabilities for at least twelve months from the date of the approval of the financial statements.

Page 14

Eastwood Park Limited

Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 March 2024

Adjusting events after the financial period

Since the year end, a previous overage agreement in respect of a land sale was renegotiated giving the company
certainty to the future cash receipt of £300,000. As a result of this renegotiation the income has been recognised in
the year.

Key sources of estimation uncertainty

In the application of the company's accounting policies, the directors are required to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The
estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be
relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised where the revision affects only that period, or in the period in
which the estimate is revised where the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future
periods where the revision affects both current and future periods.

The estimates and assumptions which are considered to have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the
carrying amount of assets and liabilities arise in respect of the valuation of freehold land and buildings for which
management are of the opinion requires no impairment. The carrying amount is £13,030,829 (2023 - £13,082,331).

Revenue recognition

Turnover comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of courses and events, and
provision of services in the ordinary course of the company’s activities. Turnover is shown net of value added tax,
returns, rebates and discounts.

The company recognises revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied:

- the amount of revenue can be reliably measured;

- all of the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer;

- the entity retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership nor
effective control over the goods sold;

- the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably;

- itis probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity; and

- specific criteria have been met for each of the company's activities.

Government grants

Government grants are accrued or deferred on a systematic basis over the period that the related costs have been
recognised. Where the costs have already been incurred then government grants are credited to the profit and loss
account in full. Grants towards capital expenditure are released to the profit and loss account over the expected useful
life of the assets

Foreign currency transactions and balances
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling and recorded at the rate of exchange ruling
at the date of the transaction.

Balances at the year end denominated in a foreign currency are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling
at the balance sheet date.

Page 15

Eastwood Park Limited

Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 March 2024

Tax

The tax expense for the period comprises deferred tax. Tax is recognised in profit or loss, except that a change
attributable to an item of income or expense recognised as other comprehensive income is also recognised directly in
other comprehensive income.

The current tax charge is calculated on the basis of tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the reporting date in the countries where the company operates and generates taxable income.

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences between taxable profits and profits reported in the
financial statements.

Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised when it is probable that they will be recovered
against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.

Deferred tax is measured using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the
reporting date and that are expected to apply to the reversal of the timing difference.

Current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.

Tangible assets

Tangible assets are stated in the balance sheet at cost or valuation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation
and subsequent accumulated impairment losses.
The cost of tangible assets includes directly attributable incremental costs incurred in their acquisition and installation.

Depreciation

Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets down to their residual value, other than land and
properties under construction over their estimated useful lives, as follows:

Asset class Depreciation method and rate
Freehold land Nil

Freehold buildings Nil - 50% straight line

Assets under construction Nil

Plant and machinery 20% - 50% straight line
Fixtures, fittings and equipment 10% - 20% straight line

Motor vehicles 12.72% straight line

Goodwill

Goodwill arising on the acquisition of an entity represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the company’s
interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the entity recognised at the
date of acquisition. Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less
accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is held in the currency of the acquired entity
and revalued to the closing rate at each reporting period date. Goodwill is amortised over its useful life, which shall not
exceed ten years if a reliable estimate of the useful life cannot be made.

Amortisation

Amortisation is provided on intangible assets so as to write off the cost, less any estimated residual value, over their
useful life as follows:

Page 16

Eastwood Park Limited

Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 March 2024

Asset class Amortisation method and rate
Goodwill 10 years
Stocks

Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell. Cost is determined
using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.

lf stocks are impaired, the carrying amount is reduced to its selling price less costs to complete and sell; the
impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.

Debtors

Trade debtors are amounts due from customers for merchandise sold or services performed in the ordinary course of
business.

Trade debtors are recognised initially at the transaction price. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost
using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. A provision for the impairment of trade debtors is
established when there is objective evidence that the company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to
the original terms of the receivables.

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and call deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments
that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value.

Creditors

Trade creditors are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of
business from suppliers. Trade creditors are classified as current liabilities if the company does not have an
unconditional right, at the end of the reporting period, to defer settlement of the creditor for at least twelve months
after the reporting date. If there is an unconditional right to defer settlement for at least twelve months after the
reporting date, they are presented as non-current liabilities.

Trade creditors are recognised initially at the transaction price and subsequently measured at amortised cost using
the effective interest method.

Borrowings

Interest-bearing borrowings are initially recorded at fair value, net of transaction costs. Interest-bearing borrowings are
subsequently carried at amortised cost, with the difference between the proceeds, net of transaction costs, and the
amount due on redemption being recognised as a charge to the profit and loss account over the period of the relevant
borrowing.

Interest expense is recognised on the basis of the effective interest method and is included in interest payable and
similar charges.

Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the company has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the
liability for at least twelve months after the reporting date.

Leases

Leases in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as
operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the
period of the lease.

Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and
rewards of ownership to the lessee.

Assets held under finance leases are recognised at the lower of their fair value at inception of the lease and the
present value of the minimum lease payments. These assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter
of the useful life of the asset and the lease term. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance
sheet as a finance lease obligation.

Lease payments are apportioned between finance costs in the profit and loss account and reduction of the lease
obligation so as to achieve a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.

Share capital

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Equity instruments are measured at the fair value of the cash or other
resources received or receivable, net of the direct costs of issuing the equity instruments. If payment is deferred and
the time value of money is material, the initial measurement is on a present value basis.

Dividends

Dividend distribution to the company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the
reporting period in which the dividends are declared.

Defined contribution pension obligation

A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which fixed contributions are paid into a pension fund and the
company has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions even if the fund does not hold sufficient
assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.

Contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as employee benefit expense when they are due. If
contribution payments exceed the contribution due for service, the excess is recognised as a prepayment.

Financial instruments

Classification

Basic financial assets, including trade and other receivables and cash and bank balances are initially recognised at
transaction price, unless the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where the transaction is measured at
the present value of the future receipts discounted at a market rate of interest.

Such assets are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

At the end of each reporting period financial assets measured at amortised cost are assessed for objective evidence
of impairment. If an asset is impaired the impairment loss is the difference between the carrying amount and the
present value of the estimated cash flows discounted at the asset's original effective interest rate. The impairment loss
is recognised in profit or loss.

lf there is a decrease in the impairment loss arising from an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the
impairment is reversed. The reversal is such that the current carrying amount does not exceed what the carrying
amount would have been had the impairment not previously been recognised. The impairment reversal is recognised
in profit or loss.

Financial assets are derecognised when

a) the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or are settled, or

b) substantially all the risks and rewards of the ownership of the asset are transferred to another party or

c) despite having retained some significant risks and rewards of ownership, control of the asset has been transferred
to another party who has the practical ability to unilaterally sell the asset to an unrelated third party without imposing
additional restrictions.

Basic financial liabilities, including trade and other payables and loans from fellow Group companies are initially
recognised at transaction price, unless the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where the debt instrument
is measured at the present value of estimated cash flows discounted at the liability's original effective interest rate.
Debt instruments are subsequently carried at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.

Financial liabilities are derecognised when the liability is extinguished, that is when the contractual obligation is
discharged, cancelled or expires.
