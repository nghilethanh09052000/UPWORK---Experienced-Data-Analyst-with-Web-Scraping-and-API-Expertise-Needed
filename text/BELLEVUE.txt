Strategic Report
For the year ended 31 August 2024

The directors present the strategic report for the year ended 31 August 2024.

The strategy of Bellevue Education International Limited (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (collectively
known as the “Group”) is to invest in its schools — through people and estates — to benefit pupils in the Group,
‘The Group is regularly approached by schools-with an interest in joining the Company and it selectively”
assesses each opportunity.

Fair review of the business

During the year, the Group successfully achieved its forecasted earnings and reached the targeted pupil
numbers. This accomplishment demonstrates the effectiveness of the Group’s strategic planning and
operational execution.

The Group’s strategic focus is educational excellence to benefit pupils in the Group's schools. Schools within
the Group collaborate and exchange ideas to benefit all. The Group has seen good organic pupil number
growth. The Group has maintained a reasonable debtor recovery position, demonstrating effective collection
and financial management. Furthermore, conservative debt payment strategies have aided in the
maintenance of a viable capital structure. The Group's net asset position indicates its financial strength and
stability, providing a solid basis for future growth and investment opportunities.

Principal risks and uncertainties

In common with many independent schools, the Group faces risks in attracting new pupils and retaining
existing ones due to various economic and demographic challenges. The ongoing cost-of-living crisis and
rising interest rates continue to impact many parents’ ability to afford private education for their children.
Additionally, a declining birth rate has begun to affect pupil numbers, presenting a long-term risk to enrolment
levels.

To mitigate these risks, the Group remains committed to offering a compelling educational proposition that
combines academic excellence, comprehensive pastoral care, and character development at a competitive
price point. The Group has also expanded interest-free fee payment instalment plans, which have seen year-
on-year growth in uptake, helping to alleviate financial pressure on families and maintain enrolment levels.

Another significant development affecting the sector is the introduction of VAT on school fees. This regulatory
change has increased the financial burden on parents and heightened concerns about affordability. The Group
is closely monitoring the impact of this policy shift and remains proactive in adapting its financial strategies to
support families. While this presents a challenge, the Group is well-positioned to attract pupils from- other
schools that may struggle to adapt to the new VAT framework, thereby mitigating the risk posed by this
change.

By maintaining its high standards and adapting to the evolving financial and demographic landscape, the
Group remains resilient and well-prepared to navigate these uncertainties while continuing to provide quality
education to its pupils.

Key performance indicators

The financial results for the year are shown in the consolidated profit and loss account on page 8 of these
financial statements. The Group's turnover for the year amounted to £57.6 million and gross profits were
£22.2 million. The increase in turnover is due to the 7% increase in tuition fees and average increase in pupil
number.

The net asset position of the group at 31 Aug 2024 were £12.2 million with net: current liabilities of £31.2
million which is mainly due to the intercompany balance with GEMS Group Holding Limited (Cayman) Limited
amounting to £12.1 million (see note 23). The Group's borrowing activities have helped to facilitate strategic
initiatives and operational expansions that are in line with its long-term growth goats.

For the year ended 31 August 2024

Engagement with employees

Enhancing employee development and wellbeing is an integral part of the culture of the Group. Senior leaders
are actively involved in planning of staff CPD, the wellbeing. focus and open communication with staff through
weekly briefings/bulletins, calendared middle leader meetings, link meetings with designated leaders and
whole staff meetings where employees are given updates on schools developments and have the opportunity.
to have questions directly.

Relationships with the suppliers

We value all of our suppliers (and consider them as our business partners), fostering long term, mutually
beneficial relationships with those critical to the School’s success. Suppliers are generally paid on 30 day
terms. Key procurement decisions are presented to the management by the Finance Director prior to the final
decision being made. The Board reviews the procurement policy annually to ensure the Group continues to
receive the best value for money.

Section 172 statement ;
‘The Directors are aware of their duties under Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 to act in the way which
they consider, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the Group for the benefit of its
members as a whole and, in doing so, to have regard (amongst others matters) to:

« The interest of the Group’s.employees.

« The need to foster the Group’s business relationship with suppliers, customers and others.

+ The impact of the Group's operation on the community and the environment.

« The desirability of the Company maintaining a reputation for high standards of teaching & learning

and business conduct. . .
« The need to act fairly as’ between members of the Group.

Directors’ Responsibilities Statement

The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with

Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the
directors have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company
law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and
fair view of the state of affairs of the group and company, and of the profit or loss of the group for that period.
In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:

« select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;

« make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;

» state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material
departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements;

the group and company will continue in business.

The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain
the. group’s and company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial
position of the group and company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the
Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the group and company and
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.


Bellevue Education International Limited

Independent Auditor's Report
To the Members of Bellevue Education International Limited

Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of Bellevue Education International Limited (the ‘parent
company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘group') for the year ended 31 August 2024 which comprise the
Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated
Statement of Financial Position, the Company Statement of Financial Position, the Consolidated Statement of -
Changes in Equity, the Company Statement of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated Statement of Cash
Flows, the Company Statement of Cash Flows and notes to the financial statements, including significant
accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable
law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 102 The Financial
Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland (United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice).

In our opinion the financial statements:
* give a true and fair view of the state of the group's and the parent company's affairs as at 31 August 2024
. and of the group's profit for the year then ended;
« have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice; and
« have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and |
applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities
for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the group and parent
company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements
in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in
accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Conclusions relating to going concern
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of
accounting in the preparation of.the financial statements is appropriate.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or
conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group's and parent company's
ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial
statements are authorised for issue. ,

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the
relevant sections of this report.

Other information
The other information comprises the information included in the annual report other than the financial
statements and our auditor's report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained
within the annual report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and,
except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance
conclusion thereon.

Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is
materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material
misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial
statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material -
misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.

Bellevue Education International Limited

Independent Auditor's Report (Continued)
To the Members of Bellevue Education International Limited

Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of our audit:
* The information given in the strategic report and the directors' report for the financial year for which the
financial statements. are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and :
« The strategic report and the directors' report have been prepared i in accordance with applicable legal
requirements. :

Matters on which we are required to report by exception

In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the parent company and their environment
obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the
directors’ report.

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006
. requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
« adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our
audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
+ the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
« certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
« we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

Responsibilities of directors

As explained more fully in the directors' responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such
internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

’ In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the parent company's ability

to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the
going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the parent company or to
cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs (UK) we exercise professional judgement: and maintain
professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

«Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to
fraud or error, design and perform ‘audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit
evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting
a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may
involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

* « Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purposes of.expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the company's internal control.


Bellevue Education International Limited

Independent Auditor's Report (Continued) .
To the Members of Bellevue Education International Limited

+ Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness: of accounting
estimates and related disclosures made by the directors.

+ Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and,
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If
we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report
to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify
our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's
report. However, future events or conditions may cause the company to cease to continue as a going
concern.

« Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the
disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in
a manner that achieves fair presentation.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control
that we identify during our audit.

Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including
fraud

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design
procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of
irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities,
including fraud is detailed below.

The objectives of our audit in respect of fraud, are; to identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of
the financial statements due to fraud; to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the assessed
risks of material misstatement due to fraud, through designing and implementing appropriate responses to
those assessed risks; and to respond appropriately to instances of fraud or suspected fraud identified during
the audit. However, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both
management and those charged with governance of the company.

Our approach was as follows:

« We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory requirements applicable to the company
and considered that the most significant are the Companies Act 2006, UK financial reporting
standards as issued by the Financial Reporting Council, and UK taxation legislation.

« We obtained an understanding of how the company complies with these requirements by discussions
with management and those charged with governance.

« We assessed the risk of material misstatement of the financial statements, including the risk of
material misstatement due to fraud and how it might occur, by holding discussions with management
and those charged with governance. :

+ We inquired of management and those charged with governance as to any known instances of
noncompliance or suspected non-compliance with laws and regulations.

« Based on this understanding, we designed specific appropriate audit procedures to identify instances
of non-compliance with laws and regulations. This included making enquiries of management and
those charged with governance and obtaining additional corroborative evidence as required.

Bellevue Education International Limited

Independent Auditor's Report (Continued)
To the Members of Bellevue Education International Limited

There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above. We are less likely to become aware of
instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations that are not closely related to events and transactions
reflected in the financial statements. Also, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is
higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by,
for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion.

Use of our report

This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of
the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company's
members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To
the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the
company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we
have formed. .

Accounting policies

Company information

Bellevue Education International Limited (“the company”) is a private limited company domiciled and
incorporated in England and Wales. The registered office is Bellevue Education International Second
Floor, 200 Union Street, London, SE1 OLX.

The group consists of Bellevue Education International Limited and all of its subsidiaries.

Accounting convention

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 102 “The Financial Reporting ©
Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland” (“FRS 102") and the requirements of the
Companies Act 2006. .

The financial statements are prepared in sterling, which is the functional currency of the company.
Monetary amounts in these financial statements are rounded to the nearest £.

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention. The principal
accounting policies adopted are set out below.

Business combinations

In the parent company financial statements, the cost of a business combination is the fair value at the
acquisition date of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed, plus
costs directly attributable to the business combination. The excess of the cost of a business combination
over the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired is recognised as
goodwill. The cost of the combination includes the estimated amount of contingent consideration that is
probable and can be measured reliably, and is adjusted for changes in contingent consideration after the
acquisition date. Provisional fair values recognised for business combinations in previous periods are
adjusted retrospectively for final fair values determined in the 12 months following the acquisition date.
Investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are accounted for at cost less impairment.

Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the value of assets (other than goodwill) and liabilities
tecognised in a business combination accounted for using the purchase method and the amounts that
can be deducted or assessed for tax, considering the manner in which the carrying amount of the asset
or liability is expected to be recovered or settled. The deferred tax recognised is adjusted against
goodwill or negative goodwill. .

Basis of consolidation .

The consolidated group financial statements consist of the financial statements of the parent company
Bellevue Education International Limited together with all entities controlled by the parent company (its
subsidiaries) and the group’s share of its interests in joint ventures and associates.

All financial statements are made up to 31 August 2024. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the
financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by
other members of the group.

All intra-group transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies
are eliminated on consolidation. Unrealised losses are also: eliminated unless the transaction provides
evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.

Subsidiaries are consolidated in the group's financial statements from the date that control commences
until the date that control ceases.

Notes To The Group Financial Statements (Continued)

1.5

Accounting policies : , (Continued)

Entities in which the group holds an interest and which are jointly controlled by the group and one or
more other venturers under a contractual arrangement are treated as joint ventures. Entities other than
subsidiary undertakings or joint ventures, in which the group has a participating interest and over whose
operating and financial policies the group exercises a significant influence, are treated as associates.

Investments in joint ventures and associates are carried in.the group balance sheet at cost plus post-
acquisition changes in the group's share of the net assets of the entity, less any impairment in value. The
carrying values of investments in joint ventures and associates include acquired goodwill.

If the group's share of losses in a joint venture or associate equals or exceeds its investment in the joint
venture or associate, the group does not recognise further losses unless it has incurred obligations to do
so or has made payments on behalf of the joint venture or associate.

Unrealised gains arising from transactions with joint ventures and associates are eliminated to the extent
of the group's interest in the entity. .

Going concern

The Directors have duly examined the available financial resources of the company and its consolidated
group, including liquid assets and access to borrowing facilities. Additionally, they have taken into
account the future cash flow projections and have considered the prevailing inflationary pressures
affecting staff salaries, as well as the costs of essential commodities such as food, gas, and electricity.
These factors have the potential to adversely impact fee income.

After making enquiries, the Directors have reached a reasonable expectation that the company and the
group possess adequate resources to continue their operations without interruption. In arriving at this
conclusion, the Directors have duly considered various events, including the prevailing economic
conditions, and have also taken into account the support available from the parent entity.

The Directors have explicitly affirmed that both the company and the group possess sufficient resources
to sustain their operations for the ensuing 12-month period, including provision of the letter of support
from its parent entity, which commences from the date the financial statements have been signed.
Accordingly, they have deemed the going concern basis of accounting as appropriate for the preparation
of these accounts. Therefore, the financial statements have been prepared on that basis.

Turnover

Turnover is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods and
services provided in the normal course of business, and is shown net of VAT and other sales related
taxes. The fair value of consideration takes into account trade discounts, settlement discounts and
volume rebates.

When cash inflows are deferred and represent a financing arrangement, the fair value of the
consideration is the present value of the future receipts. The difference between the fair value of the
consideration and the nominal amount received is recognised as interest income.

Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the
goods have passed to the buyer (usually on dispatch of the goods), the amount of revenue can be
measured reliably, it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to
the entity and the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.

1.8

Accounting policies . (Continued)

Revenue from contracts for the provision of professional services is recognised by reference to the stage
of completion when the stage of completion, costs incurred and costs to complete can be estimated
teliably. The stage of completion is calculated by comparing costs incurred, mainly in relation to
contractual hourly staff rates and materials, as a proportion of total costs. Where the outcome cannot be
estimated reliably, revenue is recognised only to the extent of the expenses recognised that it is
probable will be recovered.

Intangible fixed assets - goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition of a business over the fair value.of net assets
acquired. It is initially recognised as an asset-at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less
accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. . Goodwill is considered to have a finite
useful life and is amortised on a systematic basis over its expected life, which is 20 years. This term is
chosen because the investment is in a durable asset, i.e. school tand and buildings, and that we expect
the market for the school to continue, at'least, for that period of time.

For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the cash-generating units expected to
benefit from the acquisition. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for
impairment at least annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be
impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the
unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the
unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in.
the unit.

Intangible fixed assets other than goodwill

Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are recognised at cost and are subsequently
measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.

Intangible assets acquired on business combinations are recognised separately from goodwill at the
acquisition date where it is probable that the expected future economic benefits that are attributable to
the asset will flow to the entity and the fair value of the asset can be measured reliably; the intangible
asset arises from contractual or other legal rights; and the intangible asset is separable from the entity.

Amortisation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over
their useful lives on the following bases:

Customer relationships 4 and 6 years straight line
Marketing related asset 14 years straight line

Tangible fixed assets :
Tangible fixed assets are initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost or valuation, net
of depreciation and any impairment losses.

Bellevue Education International Limited

Notes To The Group Financial Statements (Continued)

Accounting policies (Continued)

Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over
their useful lives on the following bases:

Freehold land and buildings 50 years
Leasehold land and buildings - 10 years '
Leasehold improvements “10 years

Plant and equipment 5 years

Fixtures and fittings 5 years

IT equipments 3 years

Motor vehicles . 5 years

The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the sale

. proceeds and the carrying value of the asset, and is recognised in the profit and loss account.

1.9

1.10

Fixed asset investments .

Equity investments are measured at fair value through profit or loss, except for those equity investments
that are not publicly traded and whose fair value cannot otherwise be measured reliably, which are
recognised at cost less impairment until a reliable measure of fair value becomes available.

In the parent company financial statements, investments in subsidiaries are initially measured at cost
and subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.

A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the group. Control is the power to govern the financial and
operating policies of the entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.

Impairment of fixed assets

At each reporting period end date, the group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible
assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
lf any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the
extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an
individual asset, the company estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the
asset belongs.

" Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in

use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate
that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset
for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.

If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying
amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless the relevant asset is carried at a
revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.

Recognised impairment losses are reversed if, and only if, the reasons for the impairment loss have
ceased to apply. Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or
cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the
increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had
no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of
an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless the relevant asset is carried at a
revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.

Stocks

, Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell. Cost

comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have
been incurred in bringing the stocks to their present location and condition. ,

Stocks held for distribution at no or nominal consideration are measured at the lower of cost and

loss in profit or loss. Reversals of impairment losses are also recognised in profit or loss.

Cash and cash equivalents

‘Cash and cash equivalents are basic financial assets and include cash in hand, deposits held at call with

banks, other short-term liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, and bank
overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities.

Financial instruments :
The group has elected to apply the provisions of Section 11 ‘Basic Financial Instruments’ and Section 12
‘Other Financial Instruments Issues’ of FRS 102 to all of its financial instruments.

Financial instruments are recognised in the group's balance sheet when the group becomes party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument.

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amounts presented in the financial statemerits when
there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on
a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Basic financial assets ,

Basic financial assets, which include debtors and cash and bank balances, are initially measured at
transaction price including transaction costs and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the
effective interest method unless the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where the

transaction is measured at the present value of the future receipts discounted at a market rate of

interest. Financial assets classified as receivable within one year are not amortised.

impairment of financial assets :
Financial assets, other than those held at fair value through profit and loss, are assessed for indicators
of impairment at each reporting end date.

Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events
that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows have been
affected. If an asset is impaired, the impairment loss is the difference between the carrying amount and
the present value of the estimated cash flows discounted at the asset's original effective interest rate.
The impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss.

If there is a decrease in the impairment loss arising from an event occurring after the impairment was
recognised, the impairment is reversed. The reversal is such that the current carrying amount does not
exceed what the carrying amount would have been, had the impairment not previously been recognised.
The impairment reversal is recognised in profit or loss.

Accounting policies : , (Continued)

Derecognition of financial assets

Financial assets are derecognised only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset
expire or are settled, or when the group transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and
rewards of ownership to another entity, or if some significant risks and rewards of ownership are retained
but control of the asset has transferred to another party that is able to sell the asset in its entirety to an
unrelated third party.

Classification of financial liabilities .

Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual
arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the
assets of the group after deducting all of its liabilities.

Basic financial liabilities

Basic financial liabilities, including creditors, bank loans, loans from fellow group companies and
préference shares that are classified as debt, are initially recognised at transaction price ‘unless the
arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where the debt instrument is measured at the present
value of the future payments discounted at a market rate of interest. Financial liabilities classified as
payable within one year are not amortised.

Debt instruments are subsequently carried at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.

Trade creditors are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary
course of business from suppliers. Amounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due
within one year or less. If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities. Trade creditors are
recognised initially at transaction price and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective
interest method.

Derecognition of financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the group's contractual obligations expire or are discharged
or cancelled.

Equity instruments

Equity instruments issued by the group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of transaction costs.
Dividends payable on equity instruments are recognised as liabilities once they are no longer at the
discretion of the group.

Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.

Current tax

The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as
reported in the profit and loss account because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable
or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The
group's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the reporting end date. -

’ Deferred tax

Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all timing differences and deferred tax assets are
recognised to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax
liabilities or other future taxable profits. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the timing
difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction
that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting end date and reduced to the

extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the

asset to be recovered. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period

when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the profit and

loss account, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the

deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if, and only if, there is |
a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and the deferred tax assets and

liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority.

Employee benefits
The costs of short-term employee benefits are recognised as a liability and an expense, unless those
costs are required to be recognised as part of the cost of stock or fixed assets.

The cost of any unused holiday entitlement is recognised in the period in which the employee’s services
are received.

Termination benefits are recognised immediately as an expense when the company is demonstrably
committed to terminate the employment of an employee or to provide termination benefits. .

Retirement benefits
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are’ charged as an | expense as they fall
due.

Leases

Rentals payable under operating leases, including any lease incentives received, are charged to profit or
loss on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease except where another more systematic
basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset are
consumed.

2 Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty

In the application of the group's accounting policies, the directors are required to make judgements,
estimates and assumptions about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily
apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical
experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these
estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to
accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised where the revision
affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods where the revision affects both
current and future periods.

The significant judgements made by management in applying the Group's accounting policies as set out
above, and the key sources of estimation, were:

« Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is based on estimate useful economic life.

« Amortisation of goodwill is based on estimate useful economic life.

+ Debts are provided for if they are not considered to be fully recoverable .in line with the
company's policy. Estimating amounts to provide against recovery of debits is a matter of
judgement.

« Investment in subsidiaries are assessed for impairment on an annual basis. The directors review
the prospected pupil numbers and fee income for each subsidiary and assess the recoverability
of the investment value.
