Lee Marley Brickwork Limited
Strategic Report
Year ended 31 December 2023

The Directors present the Strategic Report for the year ended 31 December 2023.
Overview and Principal Activity

Lee Marley was established in 1997 and is the Uk's largest integrated masonry and scaffold company.
The company operates from offices in London, Reading and Glasgow, and specialises in large-scale,
high-rise and complex projects with a focus on mixed-use development, affordable & social housing and
institutional build-to-rent.

Results for the Year and KPIs

The company returned to profit £2.8m (2022: -£2.2m) and recorded record turnover of £79.8m (2022:
£65.6m). The increase reflects growth in both the Brickwork and Scaffolding divisions, driven by the
strength of our longstanding relationships with our clients, the quality of our services and our extensive
experience. :

The company starts 2024 with a record order book of £114m (2023: £81m). Our core market has
remained strong with most large-scale developments underpinned by growing investment in affordabie
housing and institutional investment in rental homes.

We continue to operate within our available facilities and we have a resilient balance sheet, underpinned
by continued investment in plant, equipment and staff, which positions the business for growth in 2024
and beyond.

People, Health and Safety and the Environment

People
People continue to be the heart of the business and one of our key stakeholders. Our Section 172
statement below sets out how we have engaged with and supported our people.

Training the next generation has always been at the heart of the business and in 2023 the organisation
made its biggest investment to date in its human capital by opening the Lee Marley Academy, a
partnership with London South Bank Technical College. The academy is staffed by Lee Marley tutors
and its aim is to bridge the skills and knowledge gap between traditional apprenticeship training and
the modern methods of construction used on high-rise construction projects. Continuous periods of
workshop and classroom learning are combined with practical work experience on existing Lee Marley
projects and the scheme will see apprentices reach their end-point-assessment in 14 months as opposed
to a minimum of 24 months on current pathways.

The company employs 85 apprentices spanning our core trades of brickwork and scaffolding as well as
in construction management and quantity surveying. Our continuing investment was rewarded by being
ranked first in the Department for Education's "Top SO SME Apprenticeship Employers 2023".

The company also runs its own graduate scheme and encourages continual learning and upskilling of
its workforce and management.

Health and Safety

Our starting point for safety is zero-harm. Our in-house team strive for continual improvement in
performance driven by training, toolbox talks, information campaigns and a robust inspection regime.
As a result, our AFR fell to 0.45 (2022: 2.59) with our scaffolding division achieving an AFR of 0.00. Our
management system is accredited to ISO 45001 and the company received a Gold Award by the Royal
Society for the Prevention of Accidents for the third year running.

Lee Marley Brickwork Limited
Strategic Report (continued)

Year ended 31 December 2023

The Environment

In 2023 Lee Marley joined the Science Based Targets Initiative. Science-based targets provide
companies with a clearly defined path to reduce emissions in line with the Paris Agreement goals and -
as part of this the group commits to reduce scope 1 and scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions 42% by
2030 from a 2022 base year and to measure and reduce its scope 3 emissions. The company is
accredited to the Gold Standard by the Fleet Operator Recognition Scheme which facilitates the
monitoring of fleet fue! consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. The company continues to manage
its environmental risks and performance via the IS014001 framework.

Stakeholder Engagement (Section 172 Statement)

The following outlines our key stakeholder groups and the engagement strategies employed across
each.

Employees

The strength of our business and our brand is underpinned by attracting and retaining the best talent
in the market. We engage with our employees to ensure they feel valued and motivated, understand
what is expected of them and how they are supported to deliver these expectations.

Throughout the year we engaged with our employees through:
* Regular feedback meetings and annual performance reviews
* Targeted training and toolbox talks, covering topics such as mental health awareness
¢ Quarterly business newsletters covering industry updates, key achievements, and major events

We regularly celebrate the successes of our employees and apprentices via social media.

Suppliers

Engagement with our suppliers helps to ensure that we can deliver a high level of service and value for
money to our customers. Agency and subcontracted labour are particularly important in this respect as
they represent our business on a day-to-day basis.

We also undertake regular service review meetings with our key suppliers and involve them in the
tender process for new work.

Customers

It is imperative that we engage with our customers to maintain our existing relationships and to support
new business opportunities. Our business is reliant on our reputation within our key markets and the
repeat business of major housebuilders and tier-one contractors.

Engagement with customers begins at the contract tender stage, and our senior management teams
meet with their counterparts at our customers on at least a monthly basis. We issue customer feedback
surveys at the end of our projects and contribute to our customer's own project debriefs.

ESG credentials are increasingly important to our customers and we regularly engage with them on
social value matters, particularly the strength of our apprenticeship scheme and the value this brings to
local communities.


Lee Marley Brickwork Limited
Strategic Report (continued)

Year ended 31 December 2023

Communities

The projects we work on have a lasting impact on local communities. Engagement with them is
important in maintaining our reputation and brand, in supporting new business opportunities, and in
attracting new talent.

We add value to communities through our apprenticeship and graduate schemes and regularly engage
with local schools and colleges to promote careers in construction. We make full use of grants and
funding available from the likes of the CITB and the London Collaboration Partnership to support our
apprentices through their training.

Funders

We maintain open and transparent relationships with our main debt provider, over and above required
compliance reporting. Key executives from our bank have toured a number of our projects in order to
get a better understanding of the scale and quality of the work that we undertake. In addition, staff
from our bank give talks on household finance and money management to apprentices at our academy.
This builds confidence in our business and opens opportunities for supporting and funding further
growth.

Principal Risks and Uncertainty

The process of risk acceptance and risk management is addressed through a framework of policies,
procedures and internal controls. All policies are subject to Board approval and ongoing review by
management. Compliance with regulation, legal and ethical standards is a priority.

The principal risks arise from inaccurate pricing and inadequate management of projects, as well as
exposure to changes in the property market. As noted below, the company's forecasts and working
capital headroom are regularly reviewed by the Board to ensure that these risks can be mitigated as
effectively as possible. The strength of the forward order book and visibility into 2025 and beyond
enables the company to keep financial risk sufficiently low.

Financial Risk Management

The Board regularly reviews the financial requirements of the company and the associated risks. Our
operations are primarily financed from retained earnings, short and medium-term borrowings, as well
as finance leases. The company does not use complex financial instruments.

Liquidity risk
To manage liquidity risk, the Board regularly reviews and updates forecast performance, induding a
detailed cash flow model, and headroom against its borrowings and associated covenants.

Credit risk

The company takes prudent steps to monitor and manage its exposure to credit risk, including due
diligence on its customers using information from suppliers, credit ratings agencies and insurers, and
the use of a comprehensive credit insurance policy. Project payment performance is a key metric used
to manage cash flow and liquidity.

Price risk !
Due to the nature of its financial instruments, the company is not exposed to price risk.

Lee Marley Brickwork Limited
Independent Auditor's Report to the Members of Lee Marley Brickwork Limited

Year ended 31 December 2023
Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of Lee Marley Brickwork Limited (the ‘company’) for the year
ended 31 December 2023 which comprise the statement of income and retained earnings, statement
of financial position, statement of cash flows and the related notes, including a summary of significant
accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is
applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 102 The Financial Reporting
Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice).

In our opinion the financial statements:

« give a true and fair view of the state of the company's affairs as at 31 December 2023 and of its
profit for the year then ended;

. have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice;

«have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and
applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the auditor's
responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of
the company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial
statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Conclusions relating to going concern

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern
basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to
events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the company's ability
to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements
are authorised for issue.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described
in the relevant sections of this report.


Lee Marley Brickwork Limited

Independent Auditor's Report to the Members of Lee Marley Brickwork Limited (continued)

Year ended 31 December 2023

Other information

The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial
statements and our auditor's report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent
otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the
financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially
misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are
required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that
there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.

Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

« the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for
which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and

« the strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable
legal requirements.

Matters on which we are required to report by exception

In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the
course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’
report.

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act
2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:

« adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been
received from branches not visited by us; or

. the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
¢ certain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or

« — we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.


Lee Marley Brickwork Limited
Independent Auditor's Report to the Members of Lee Marley Brickwork Limited (continued)

Year ended 31 December 2023

Responsibilities of directors

As explained more fully in the directors' responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and
for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the company's ability
to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using
the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the company or to
cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report
that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that
an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it
exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on
the basis of these financial statements.

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design
procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect
of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting
irregularities, including fraud is detailed below:

Based on our understanding of the company and industry, we identified the principal risks of non
compliance with laws and regulations and we considered the extent to which non-compliance might
have a material effect on the financial statements. We also considered those laws and regulations that
have a direct impact on the preparation of the financial statements such as the Companies Act 2006,
FRS102, Health and Safety laws, employment laws, contract laws, General Data Protection Regulations
and UK tax legislation. We evaluated management's incentives and opportunities for fraudulent
manipulation of the financial statements (including the risk of override of controls) and determined that
the principal risks were related to fraudulent transactions that may lead to an overstatement of profits
such as manipulation of work in progress and understatement of expenses, in order to increase the
value and borrowing capacity of the company as the company relies on bank loans to improve the
liquidity position. Audit procedures performed by the audit team included:

* To perform audit testing in different sections in order to check the compliance with applicable
regulations and discussions with management including consideration of known or suspected
instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations and fraud.

* Identifying and testing journal entries, in particular any journal entries posted with unusual
account combinations, significant one-off amounts or posted by senior management.

* Challenging and validating the reasonableness and judgement of any key management
assumptions with particular focus on work in progress, depreciation and accruals as these are
the key accounting estimates.

Lee Marley Brickwork Limited
Independent Auditor's Report to the Members of Lee Marley Brickwork Limited (continued)

Year ended 31 December 2023

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the
Financial Reporting Council's website at:

www.frc.org.uk/library/standards-codes-policy/audit-assurance-and-ethics/auditors-responsibilities-for-
the-audit/. This description forms part of our auditor's report.

There are inherent limitations on the audit procedure described above. Also, the risk of not detecting a
material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as
fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations or
through collusion.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs (UK), we exercise professional judgment and maintain
professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

. Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to
fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit
evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not
detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error,
as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override
of internal control.

¢ Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
Procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control.

« Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates and related disclosures made by the directors.

« Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting
and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events
or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going
concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in
our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are
inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up
to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the company
to cease to continue as a going concern.

« Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the
disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events
in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned
scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in
internal contro! that we identify during our audit.

Lee Marley Brickwork Limited
Notes to the Financial Statements

Year ended 31 December 2023

General information

The company is a private company limited by shares, registered in England and Wales. The address
of the registered office is Unit 185, Viscount Way, Woodley, Berkshire, RGS 4DZ.

Statement of compliance

These finandal statements have been prepared in compliance with FRS 102, The Financial
Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and the Republic of Ireland’.

Accounting policies

Basis of preparation

The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, as modified by the
revaluation of certain financial assets and liabilities and investment properties measured at fair
value through profit or loss.

The financial statements are prepared in sterling, which is the functional currency of the entity.

Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty

The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates
and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. These estimates and judgements are
continually reviewed and are based on experience and other factors, including expectations of
future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

Revenue recognition

Turnover is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents
amounts receivable for goods supplied and services rendered, stated net of discounts and of Value
Added Tax.

Where the outcome of a construction contract can be estimated reliably, revenue and costs are
recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity at the date of the
statement of financial position. This is normally measured by the proportion contract costs incurred
for work performed to date bear to the estimated contract costs, except where this would not be
representative of the stage of completion. Variations in contract work, claims and incentive
payments are included to the extent that the amount can be measured reliably and its receipt is
considered probable.

Where the outcome of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is
recognised to the extent of contract costs incurred where it is probable they will be recoverable.
Contract costs are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred.

When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract value, the expected loss is
recognised as an expense immediately.

Income tax

The taxation expense represents the aggregate amount of current and deferred tax recognised in
the reporting period. Tax is recognised in profit or loss, except to the extent that it relates to items
recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, tax is recognised in
other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.

Income tax (continued)

Current tax is recognised on taxable profit for the current and past periods. Current tax is measured
at the amounts of tax expected to pay or recover using the tax rates and laws that have been
enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences at the reporting date. Unrelieved
tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that they
will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.
Deferred tax is measured using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the reporting date that are expected to apply to the reversal of the timing difference.

Operating leases

Lease payments are recognised as an expense over the lease term on a straight-line basis. The
aggregate benefit of lease incentives is recognised as a reduction to expense over the lease term,
on a straight-line basis.

Tangible assets

Tangible assets are initially recorded at cost, and subsequently stated at cost less any accumulated
depreciation and impairment losses. Any tangible assets carried at revalued amounts are recorded
at the fair value at the date of revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and
subsequent accumulated impairment losses.

An increase in the carrying amount of an asset as a result of a revaluation, is recognised in other
comprehensive income and accumulated in equity, except to the extent it reverses a revaluation
decrease of the same asset previously recognised in profit or loss. A decrease in the carrying
amount of an asset as a result of revaluation, is recognised in other comprehensive income to the .
extent of any previously recognised revaluation increase accumulated in equity in respect of that
asset. Where a revaluation decrease exceeds the accumulated revaluation gains accumulated in
equity in respect of that asset, the excess shall be recognised in profit or loss.

Depreciation
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost or valuation of an asset, less its residual value,
over the useful economic life of that asset as follows:

Leasehold Property - 20% straight line
Plant and machinery - Over 2/3/5 years
Equipment, fixtures and - Over 3/5/10 years
fittings

Motor vehicles - 25% straight line
Scaffolding - Over 3/5/12 years
Investments

Fixed asset investments are initially recorded at cost, and subsequently stated at cost less any
accumulated impairment losses.

Listed investments are measured at fair value with changes in fair value being recognised in profit
or loss.

Impairment of fixed assets

A review for indicators of impairment is carried out at each reporting date, with the recoverable
amount being estimated where such indicators exist. Where the carrying value exceeds the
recoverable amount, the asset is impaired accordingly. Prior impairments are also reviewed for
possible reversal at each reporting date.

For the purposes of impairment testing, when it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount
of an individual asset, an estimate is made of the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit
to which the asset belongs. The cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets
that includes the asset and generates cash inflows that largely independent of the cash inflows
from other assets or groups of assets.

Stocks

Stocks are measured at the lower of cost and estimated selling price less costs to complete and
sell. Cost includes all costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing
the stock to its present location and condition.

Finance leases and hire purchase contracts .
Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are recognised in the statement of
financial position as assets and liabilities at the lower of the fair value of the assets and the present
value of the minimum lease payments, which is determined at the inception of the lease term. Any
initial direct costs of the lease are added to the amount recognised as an asset.

Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the outstanding
lease liability using the effective interest method. Finance charges are allocated to each period so
as to produce a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.

Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the entity has an obligation at the reporting date as a result of a
past event, it is probable that the entity will be required to transfer economic benefits in settlement
and the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably. Provisions are recognised as a liability
in the statement of financial position and the amount of the provision as an expense.

Provisions are initially measured at the best estimate of the amount required to settle the obligation
at the reporting date and subsequently reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted to reflect
the current best estimate of the amount that would be required to settle the obligation. Any
adjustments to the amounts previously recognised are recognised in profit or loss unless the
provision was originally recognised as part of the cost of an asset. When a provision is measured
at the present value of the amount expected to be required to settle the obligation, the unwinding
of the discount is recognised as a finance cost in profit or loss in the period it arises.

Financial instruments

Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the
contractual arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a
residual interest in the assets of the entity after deducting all of its financial liabilities.

Where the contractual obligations of financial instruments (including share capital) are equivalent
to a similar debt instrument, those financial instruments are classed as financial liabilities. Financial
liabilities are presented as such in the balance sheet. Finance costs and gains or losses relating
to financial liabilities are included in the profit and loss account. Finance costs are calculated so as
to produce a constant rate of return on the outstanding liability.

Where the contractual terms of share capital do not have any terms meeting the definition of a
financial liability then this is classed as an equity instrument. Dividends and distributions relating
to equity instruments are debited direct to equity.

Defined contribution plans

Contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as an expense in the period in which
the related service is provided. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that
the prepayment will lead to a reduction in future payments or a cash refund.

When contributions are not expected to be settled wholly within 12 months of the end of the
reporting date in which the employees render the related service, the liability is measured on a
discounted present value basis. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as a finance cost in
profit or loss in the period in which it arises.

Turnover

Turnover arises from:

2023 2022
£ £
Construction contracts : 79,819,168 65,609,292

The whole of the turnover is attributable to the principal activity of the company wholly undertaken
