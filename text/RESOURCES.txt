3. Accounting Policies
Basis of preparation

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 102 "The Financial
Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland" ("FRS 102") and the
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies subject to the small
companies regime. The disclosure requirements of Section 1A of FRS 102 have been applied
other than where additional disclosure is required to show a true and fair view.

The financial statements are prepared in sterling, which is the functional currency of the
company. Monetary amounts in these financial statements are rounded to the nearest £.

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention. The principal
accounting policies adopted are set out below:

Revenue recognition

Turnover is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents
amounts receivable for services rendered, stated net of discounts and of Value Added Tax.

Income tax

The taxation expense represents the aggregate amount of current and deferred tax recognised in
the reporting period. Tax is recognised in profit or loss, except to the extent that it relates to items
recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, tax is recognised in
other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.

Current tax is recognised on taxable profit for the current and past periods. Current tax is
measured at the amounts of tax expected to pay or recover using the tax rates and laws that
have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences at the reporting date. Unrelieved tax
losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that they will
be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.
Deferred tax is measured using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the reporting date that are expected to apply to the reversal of the timing difference.

Accounting Policies (continued)
Amortisation

Amortisation is calculated so as to write off the cost of an asset, less its estimated residual value,
over the useful life of that asset as follows:
Goodwill : 10% straight line

If there is an indication that there has been a significant change in amortisation rate, useful life or
residual value of an intangible asset, the amortisation is revised prospectively to reflect the new
estimates.

Tangible assets

Tangible assets are initially recorded at cost, and subsequently stated at cost less any
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Any tangible assets carried at revalued
amounts are recorded at the fair value at the date of revaluation less any subsequent
accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses.

Depreciation

Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost or valuation of an asset, less its residual
value, over the useful economic life of that asset as follows:

Fixtures and Fittings -  25%/16.67% straight line
Motor Vehicles - 25% straight line
Computer Equipment - 25% straight line
Clothing - 33% straight line

Amounts recoverable on contracts

Services provided to customers, which at the balance sheet date had not been billed, have been
recognised as turnover. The turnover recognised in this manner is based on an assessment of
the fair value of services provided at the balance sheet date, as a proportion of the total value of
the engagement. Amounts recoverable on contracts is included in debtors.

Impairment of fixed assets

A review for indicators of impairment is carried out at each reporting date, with the recoverable
amount being estimated where such indicators exist. Where the carrying value exceeds the
recoverable amount, the asset is impaired accordingly. Prior impairments are also reviewed for
possible reversal at each reporting date.

For the purposes of impairment testing, when it is not possible to estimate the recoverable
amount of an individual asset, an estimate is made of the recoverable amount of the
cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. The cash-generating unit is the smallest
identifiable group of assets that includes the asset and generates cash inflows that largely
independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.

For impairment testing of goodwill, the goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the
acquisition date, allocated to each of the cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from
the synergies of the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the
company are assigned to those units.

Accounting Policies (continued)
Stocks

Stocks are measured at the lower of cost and estimated selling price less costs to complete and
sell: Cost includes all costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing
the stock to its present location and condition.

Financial instruments

Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the
contractual arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a
residual interest in the assets of the entity after deducting all of its financial liabilities.

Where the contractual obligations of financial instruments (including share capital) are equivalent
to a similar debt instrument, those financial instruments are classed as financial liabilities.
Financial liabilities are presented as such in the balance sheet.

Defined contribution plans

The company operates a defined contribution pension scheme covering a number of its
employees. The scheme funds are administered by trustees and the assets of the scheme are
held separately from those of the company. The pension costs charged against profits represent
the amount of the contributions payable to the scheme in respect of the accounting period.
Employee Numbers

The average number of persons employed by the company during the year amounted to 41
(2023: 48).
