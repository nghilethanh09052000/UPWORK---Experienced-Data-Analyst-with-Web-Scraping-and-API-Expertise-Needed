2 Accounting policies

Summary of significant accounting policies and key accounting estimates

The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have
been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.

Statement of compliance

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102 Section 1A smaller entities -
‘The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland’ and the Companies Act 2006 (as
applicable to companies subject to the small companies' regime).

Basis of preparation

These financial statements have been prepared using the historical cost convention except that as disclosed in the accounting
policics certain items are shown at fair value.

The financial statements are prepared in sterling, which is the functional currency of the entity.

Revenue recognition

Turnover comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and provision of services in the
ordinary course of the company’s activities. Turnover is shown net of value added tax, returns, rebates and discounts.

The company recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable that future economic
benefits will flow to the entity and specific criteria have been met for each of the company's activities.

Tax

‘he tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. ‘lax is recognised in profit or loss, except that a change
attributable to an item of income or expense recognised as other comprehensive income is also recognised directly in other
comprehensive income.

The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of tax rales and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by
the reporting date in the countries where the company operates and generates taxable income.

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences between taxable profits and profits reported in the financial
statements.

Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised when it is probable that they will be recovered against the
reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.

Deferred tax is measured using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and
that are expected to apply to the reversal of the timing difference.

Tangible assets

Tangible assets are stated in the statement of financial position at cost, less any subscqucnt accumulated depreciation and
subsequent accumulated impairment losses.
The cost of tangible assets includes directly attributable incremental costs incurred in their acquisition and installation.

Depreciation

Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than land and properties under construction over their estimated
useful lives, as follows:

Asset class Depreciation method and rate
Fittings, fixtures and equipment 25% reducing balance

Trade debtors

Short term debtors are measured at transaction price, less any impairment.
Cash and cash equivalents

Cash is represented by cash in hand and bank deposits.

Trade creditors

Short term creditors are measured at the transaction price.

Borrowings

Interest-bearing borrowings are initially recorded at fair value, net of transaction costs. Interest-bearing borrowings are
subsequently carried at amortised cost, with the difference between the proceeds, net of transaction costs, and the amount due on
redemption being recognised as a charge to the income statement over the period of the relevant borrowing.

Interest expense is recognised on the basis of the effective interest method and is included in interest payable and similar charges.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the company has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for
at least twelve months after the reporting date.

Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the company has an obligation at the reporting date as a result of a past event, it is probable that
the company will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.

Leases

Leases in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases are charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.

Defined contribution pension obligation

A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which fixed contributions are paid into a pension fund and the company has
no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions even if the fund docs not hold sufficient assets to pay all employces
the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.

Contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as employee benefit expense when they are due. If contribution
payments exceed the contribution due for service, the excess is recognised as a prepayment.
