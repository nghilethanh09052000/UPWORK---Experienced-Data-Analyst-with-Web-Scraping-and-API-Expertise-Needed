NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

General information

Clarkson Evans Training Limited is a private Company (limited by shares) incorporated and registered in
Engiand and Wales, registration number 06740272. The registered office and principal trading address is
Meteor Business Park, Cheltenham Road East, Gloucester, Gloucestershire, GL2 9QL.

Accounting policies

2.1

Basis of preparation of financial statements

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention unless otherwise
specified within these accounting policies and in accordance with FRS 102 ‘The Financial Reporting
Standard applicable in the UK and the Republic of Ireland’ and the requirements of the Companies
Act 2006. The disclosure requirements of Section 1A of FRS 102 have been applied other than
where additional disclosure is required to show a true and fair view.

The following principal accounting policies have been applied:
Going concern

Forecasts have been prepared which take into account estimates of future performance based on
changes in the economic environment. Based on the forecasts prepared and the funds available, the
directors believe that there are sufficient resources for the company to conduct business for at least
12 months post signing of the financial statements. As such, the directors believe it is appropriate for
the financial statements to be prepared on the going concern basis.

Revenue

Turnover comprises the fair value of the consideration received and provision of services in the
ordinary course of the Company's activities. Turnover is shown net of sales/value added tax, returns,
rebates and discounts.

The Company recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, it is
probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity and specific criteria have been met for
each of the Company's activities.

Revenue from services is recognised in the period in which the services are rendered.
Government grants

Government grants are recognised based on the accrual model and are measured at the fair value of
the asset received or receivable. Grants are classified as relating either to revenue or to assets.
Grants relating to revenue are recognised in income over the period in which the related costs are
recognised. Grants relating to assets are recognised over the expected useful life of the asset.
Where part of a grant relating to an asset Is deferred, it is recognised as deferred income.

Funding is receivabie from the Skills Funding Agency, a Government executive agency sponsored by

the Department of Education, to assist with apprenticeship training program costs which is accounted
for as a revenue grant.

2.5 Pensions

26

Defined contribution pension plan

The Company operates a defined contribution pian for its employees. A defined contribution plan is a
pension plan under which the Company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. Once the
contributions have been paid the Company has no further payment obligations.

The contributions are recognised as an expense in profit or loss when they fall due. Amounts not paid
are shown in accruals as a liability in the Balance Sheet. The assets of the plan are held separately
from the Company in independently administered funds.

Current and deferred taxation

The tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in profit or loss
except that a charge attributable to an item of income and expense recognised as other
comprehensive income or to an item recognised directly in equity is also recognised in other
comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.

The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of tax rates and laws that have been
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date in the countries where the Company
operates and generates income.

Deferred tax balances are recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not
teversed by the balance sheet date, except that:

. The recognition of deferred tax assets is limited to the extent that it is probable that they will be
recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits; and
. Any deferred tax balances are reversed if and when all conditions for retaining associated tax

allowances have been met.

Deferred tax balances are not recognised in respect of permanent differences except in respect of
business combinations, when deferred tax is recognised on the differences between the fair values of
assets acquired and the future tax deductions available for them and the differences between the fair
values of liabilities acquired and the amount that will be assessed for tax. Deferred tax is determined
using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.

directly attributable ta bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of

estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method.

prospectively if appropriate, or if there is an indication of a significant change since the last reporting
date.

and are recognised in profit or loss.

Assets under construction are not depreciated until brought into use.

financial assets and ltabilities like trade and other debtors and creditors, loans from banks and other
third parties, loans to related parties and investments in ordinary shares.

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the Balance sheet when
there is an enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a
net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
