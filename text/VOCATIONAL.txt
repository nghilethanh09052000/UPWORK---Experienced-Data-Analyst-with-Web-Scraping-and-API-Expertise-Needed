NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2024

1. General information

Vocational Training Services Care Sector Limited is a private company limited by shares incorporated in England and Wales.
The registered office is Suites 5 Chalkwell Lawns, 648-656 London Road, Westcliff on Sea, Essex, SSO SHR.

The principal activity of the company continued to be that of vocational training courses for the care sector.
2. Accounting policies
2.1 Basis of preparation of financial statements

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention unless otherwise specified within these
accounting policies and in accordance with FRS 102 'The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and the
Republic of Ireland’ and the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. The disclosure requirements of Section 1A of FRS
102 have been applied other than where additional disclosure is required to show a true and fair view.

The following principal accounting policies have been applied:
2.2 Going concern

The directors have considered the possible effects of the impacts on the company of the global markets and, taking into
account a period exceeding 12 months from the date of approval of these financial statements, the directors have a
reasonable expectation that the company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable
future, and for this reason will continue to adopt the going concern basis in the preparation of the financial statements.

2.3 Revenue

Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the company and the
revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is measured as the fair value of the consideration received or receivable,
excluding discounts, rebates, value added tax and other sales taxes. The following criteria must also be met before
revenue is recognised:

Rendering of services

Revenue from a contract lo provide services is recognised in the period in which the services are provided in accordance
with the stage of completion of the contract when all of the following conditions are satisfied:

the amount of revenue can be measured reliably;

it is probable that the company will receive the consideration due under the contract;

the stage of completion of the contract at the end of the reporting period can be measured reliably; and

the costs incurred and the costs to complete the contract can be measured reliably.
2.4 Interest income

Interest income is recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2024

Accounting policies (continued)
2.5 Pensions
Defined contribution pension plan

The company operates a defined contribution plan for its employees. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under
which the company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. Once the contributions have been paid the company
has no further payment obligations.

The contributions are recognised as an expense in profit or loss when they fall due. Amounts not paid are shown in
accruals as a liability in the Balance Sheet. The assets of the plan are held separately from the company in independently
administered funds.

2.6 Current and deferred taxation

The tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in profit or loss except that a charge
attributable to an item of income and expense recognised as other comprehensive income or to an item recognised
directly in equity is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.

The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the balance sheet date in the countries where the company operates and generates income.

Deferred tax balances are recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the
balance sheet date, except that:

The recognition of deferred tax assets is limited to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered against
the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits; and

Any deferred tax balances are reversed if and when all conditions for retaining associated tax allowances have
been met.

Deferred tax balances are not recognised in respect of permanent differences except in respect of business
combinations, when deferred tax is recognised on the differences between the fair values of assets acquired and the
future tax deductions available for them and the differences between the fair values of liabilities acquired and the amount
that will be assessed for tax. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the balance sheet date.

2.7 Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets under the cost model are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any
accumulated impairment losses. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to bringing the asset to
the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.
At each reporting date the company assesses whether there is any indication of impairment. If such indication exists, the

recoverable amount of the asset is determined which is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
An impairment loss is recognised where the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount.

Accounting policies (continued)

2.7 Tangible fixed assets (continued)

Depreciation is charged so as to allocate the cost of assets less their residual value over their estimated useful lives, on
the following bases.

Depreciation is provided on the following basis:

Plant and machinery - 15% reducing balance
Fixtures and fittings - 25% — straight line

The assets’ residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted prospectively if
appropriate, or if there is an indication of a significant change since the last reporting date.

Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised
in profit or loss.

2.8 Debtors

Short-term debtors are measured at transaction price, less any impairment. Loans receivable are measured initially at fair
value, net of transaction costs, and are measured subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less
any impairment.

2.9 Cash and cash equivalents

Cash is represented by cash in hand and deposits with financial institutions repayable without penalty on notice of not
more than 24 hours. Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments that mature in no more than three months from the
date of acquisition and that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash with insignificant risk of change in value.

2.10 Creditors

Short-term creditors are measured at the transaction price. Other financial liabilities, including bank loans, are measured
initially at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are measured subsequently at amortised cost using the effective
interest method.

2.11 Provisions for liabilities

Provisions are recognised when an event has taken place that gives rise to a legal or constructive obligation, a transfer of
economic benefits is probable and a reliable estimate can be made.

Provisions are measured as the best estimate of the amount required to settle the obligation, taking into account the

related risks and uncertainties.

Increases in provisions are generally charged as an expense to profit or loss.

Accounting policies (continued)

2.12 Financial instruments

The company has elected to apply the provisions of Section 11 “Basic Financial Instruments” of FRS 102 to all of its
financial instruments.

Financial instruments are recognised in the company's Balance Sheet when the company becomes party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument.

Financial assets and liabilities are offset, with the net amounts presented in the financial statements, when there is a
legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to realise
the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Basic financial assets

Basic financial assets, which include trade and other debtors, cash and bank balances, are initially measured at their
transaction price (adjusted for transaction costs except in the initial measurement of financial assets that are
subsequently measured at fair value through profit and loss) and are subsequently carried at their amortised cost using
the effective interest method, less any provision for impairment, unless the arrangement constitutes a financing
transaction, where the transaction is measured at the present value of the future receipts discounted at a market rate of
interest.

Discounting is omitted where the effect of discounting is immaterial. The company’s cash and cash equivalents, trade and
most other debtors due with the operating cycle fall into this category of financial instruments.

Financial liabilities

Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements
entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the company after the
deduction of all its liabilities.

Basic financial liabilities, which include trade and other creditors, bank loans and other loans are initially measured at their
transaction price (adjusting for transaction costs except in the initial measurement of financial liabilities that are
subsequently measured at fair value through profit and loss). When this constitutes a financing transaction, whereby the
debt instrument is measured at the present value of the future payments discounted at a market rate of interest,
discounting is omitted where the effect of discounting is immaterial.

Debt instruments are subsequently carried at their amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.

Trade creditors are obligations to pay for goods and services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business
from suppliers. Trade creditors are classified as current liabilities if the payment is due within one year. If not, they
represent non-current liabilities. Trade creditors are initially recognised at their transaction price and subsequently are
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Discounting is omitted where the effect of discounting is
immaterial.

Derecognition of financial instruments

Derecognition of financial assets

Financial assets are derecognised when their contractual right to future cash flow expire, or are settled, or when the
company transfers the asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to another party. If significant risks

and rewards of ownership are retained after the transfer to another party, then the company will continue to recognise the
value of the portion of the risks and rewards retained.
