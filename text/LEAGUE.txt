Trustees’ annual strategic report and financial statements

’ Trustees’ Annual Strategic Report (continued)

The Trustees, who act as Directors for the purposes of company law, are pleased to present their annual trustees’
strategic report together with the financial statements of the charity for the year ended 30 June 2024 which are
prepared to meet the requirements for a directors’ report, a strategic report, and accounts for Companies Act
purposes.

The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting policies set out in the notes to
the accounts and comply with the charity's governing document, the Charities Act 2011 and Accounting and
Reporting by Charities: Statement of Recommended Practice applicable to charities preparing their accounts in
accordance with the Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland (FRS 102) effective
1 January 2019.

Structure, Governance and Management

League Football Education (LFE) is a charitable company limited by guarantee, incorporated on 2 June 2004 and
registered as a charity on 15 July 2004. LFE is governed by its Memorandum and Articles of Association adopted
on 16 June 2004 and subsequently amended on 28 July 2010 and 7 September 2012.

Trustees
The Trustees are listed on page 3.

The Board of Trustees is responsible for the overall governance of LFE. Each member of LFE is entitled to appoint
up to two Trustees. Trustees are appointed by the members and due to the background and experience of the
Trustees appointed they already have a good understanding of LFE’s business and of the Charity sector in general,
therefore, the training requirements for new Trustees are limited. However, on appointment new Trustees are
provided with an overview of LFE, its aims and objectives, business processes and risk strategy together with the
Charity Commission’s expectations of Trustees.

The Board plan to meet at least quarterly however additional meetings are scheduled should the need arise. The
Board approve annual operating plans and budgets and an annual AGM is utilised to approve the Accounts and
appoint External Auditors.

The income and assets of the Charity shall be applied solely towards the promotion of the Objects and no part
shall be paid or transferred directly or indirectly, by way of dividend, bonus or otherwise by way of profit, to
members of the Charity, and no Trustee shall be appointed to any office of the Charity paid by salary or fees or
receive any remuneration or other benefit in money or money's worth from the Charity.

Every member of the Charity undertakes to contribute such amount as may be required (not exceeding £10) to
the Charity's assets if it should be wound up.

The Trustees retain the oversight of the financial and operational activities of the Charity and are responsible for
the recruitment and performance of the Chief Executive Officer.

The Trustees meet annually to review the pay and remuneration of the Senior Management Team (comprising of
Chief Executive Officer, Chief Education Officer, Designated Safeguarding Officer and Quality Lead) and in
conjunction with the Chief Executive Officer, pay is set according to the market rate at the time and comparisons
made with similar roles in other organisations within the industry.

Organisational Structure

Day to day management of LFE is delegated to the Chief Executive Officer who is responsible for implementing
policy as agreed by the Trustees. The Chief Executive Officer ensures the Trustees are informed of all financial,
Operational and strategic developments and ensures all material transactions receive Trustee approval. LFE is
committed to maintaining the highest possible standards to meet its social, moral and legal responsibilities to
safeguard the welfare of every learner and works in partnership with The English Football League (EFL) and The
Professional Footballers’ Association (PFA) in order to achieve this. The Chief Executive Officer also has overall
responsibility for the safeguarding of the learners.

The Chief Executive Officer is supported by a Senior Management Team and staff split into Educational and
Support Teams. The Educational Team manage the delivery of education ensuring co-ordination between the
learners, employers and educational partners. The Support Team provide administrative and management

Trustees’ Annual Strategic Report (continued)

support to the Education Team and all stakeholders and ensure that the fundamental company functions such as
Quality Assurance, Finance, HR, IT and MIS are delivered effectively.

The LFE Board consists of representatives from The Professional Footballers’ Association and The Football League
Limited. LFE provide educational and vocational training for apprentice footballers aged 16 to 18 who aspire to
progress to professional footballer status at the end of their Level 3 Sporting Excellence Professional (SEP)
Apprenticeship. LFE has a key responsibility to ensure apprentices’ personal development and employability skills
are catered for given that a high percentage do not achieve professional footballer status and therefore seek
alternative positive destinations such as other employment, training or further education. LFE also ensure that
the clubs that run a full-time or hybrid youth development programme at under 16 sufficiently monitor the
educational progress of these players within the academy system to ensure they are not educationally
disadvantaged.

SEP is supported and delivered by a variety of tutors, assessors, youth coaches and education officers based at
the football club academies. Education also takes place at Further Education Colleges and other sub-contracted
education providers. LFE currently engage with 67 Professional Football Clubs (64 out of the 72 EFL Clubs and 3
from the National League). In addition to the apprenticeship programme LFE also delivered a study programme
within 13 EFL club community organisations (CCO’s), in conjunction with their Community, Education Football
Alliance (CEFA) Games Programme. This programme was new to LFE in 2016/17 and during the year ending 30
June 2024 LFE saw a further increase in learner numbers to a total of 678 from 605 in the previous year, however
this number reduces to 610 in the 2024/25 year.

Financial review

The Statement of Financial Activities (SoFA), Balance Sheet, Statement of Cash Flows and notes to the accounts
are set out on subsequent pages. The SoFA details total incoming resources of £11.877m, of which £11.637m is
income from charitable activities and £240k represents income from cash deposits during the year. The income
from charitable activities includes £6.159m from the Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) for the 16-18
apprenticeship delivery and a further £3.592m in respect of the 16-18 study programme. £1.642m was received
from the Professional Footballers’ Association to support the work we carry out with the Professional Football
Clubs and their associated Apprentices. A further £140k of income was received from clubs in respect of the co-
investment required by the ESFA for employers to contribute towards the cost of their apprenticeship training,
together with £104k from the Turing Scheme in respect of European transition activities.

During the year resources consumed totalled £11.737m. Of this, £8.286m was spent on the provision of education
and training, £2.623m was spent on staff costs and £724k was spent on other support costs together with the
costs associated with the Turing Scheme programme of £104k. The surplus for the year ended 30 June 2024
was £140k. .

Total income increased by £222k, predominantly due to an increase in ESFA revenue of £772k, £289k on the
apprenticeship programme due to a higher funding amount per apprentice, together with £482k on the study
programme due to a higher number of learners having enrolled in September 2023 together with an increased
funding rate per learner. The employer co-investment contributions remained the same as previous year, however
interest received increased by £104k. These increases were partially offset by a small reduction in revenue of
£97k from the EFL. The Erasmus+ revenue also came to an end during 2022/23 year and was partially replaced
by a much smaller project funded by the Turing Scheme, the funding across these projects significantly reduced
in the year by £558k.

During the year ending 30 June 2024 there was an increase in total expenditure of £149k, predominantly caused
by an overall increase of £573k in respect of the direct provision of education and training and an increase in staff
costs of £117k, other support costs of £16k all of which were offset by a saving of £558k in respect of the Turing
scheme costs.

The charity had an unrestricted funds balance of £2,999,074 as at 30" June 2024. These unrestricted funds are
available for general purposes and there are considered to be no commitments against these funds for any liability
that has not been accrued for.

Trustees’ Annual Strategic Report (continued)
Risk Review

A review of the risks faced by LFE was conducted during the year and systems established to mitigate those risks.
LFE has identified the business risks it faces and has documented these within its development plan and updates
them annually in the form of a risk matrix. The current most significant risks to LFE are the external financial
tisks together with concerns regarding the long-term sustainability of Football Clubs and their academy operations
many of which continue to be under financial strain following the pandemic.

The external risks are those associated with government funded educational programmes. Historically 16-18 year
old apprenticeships were fully funded by the government, however in April 2017, this changed with the
implementation of the Apprenticeship Levy and the requirement for all employers to contribute towards the cost
of apprenticeship training.

All employers throughout the UK with an annual payroll bill of more than £3m are subject to paying the
Apprenticeship Levy. The levy fee is 0.5% of the employers’ payroll costs in excess of £3m, which is used by the
employer to pay for the education of their apprentices via the PAYE system and managed through their
Apprenticeship Service account. Over 85% of the employers that LFE currently provide education and training to
are subject to paying the Apprenticeship Levy. However, over half of these employers, do not pay enough
Apprenticeship Levy to cover the whole cost of their apprenticeship training and as a result of this, these
employers have had to co-invest a further 5% of their shortfall in Levy paid.

The remaining non-levy paying employers that LFE works with were required to pay 5% of the cost of the
education and training, as a co-investment, with the government paying the remaining 95%. This was a significant
amount for each employer, given they provide an apprenticeship programme for approximately 18 apprentices
over a two year period, however, these non-levy paying employers will no longer be required to co-invest due to
a government policy change.

The apprenticeship levy and the employer co-investment have now been in place for just over seven years and
have so far not significantly impacted on the number of apprentices that LFE care for, however, our apprentice
intake was lower for the new starts in 2020 mainly due the impact of the pandemic. Since then, recruitment
numbers are back to pre-pandemic levels. However, over the same seven-year period the national minimum wage
for apprentices has also increased by more than 70% so for a club that employs 18 apprentices within their youth
department at any one time has an annual cost of £180k, compared to a cost of £98k seven years ago. As
minimum wages continue to increase this may affect the number of apprentices recruited by the clubs in future.

A further risk is that of the long-term sustainability of Footbal! Clubs given wider financial issues affecting the
game as a whole. This could potentially be part of their decision-making process to maybe close their academy
operations, which will in turn impact on the revenue and the number of learners LFE take care of.

An additional risk for LFE is that of the Government Review of Subcontracting. LFE support learners on a
government funded 16~19-year-old Study Programme within 15 (previously 13) Club Community Organisations
(CCO’s) across England. Many of these learners come from disadvantaged backgrounds and they are often
inspired to continue with their Post16 education through a football environment. However, most of the education
delivery of this programme is sub-contracted to the CCO’s and the Government continue to review sub-contracted
delivery. :

After due consideration, the Trustees consider that League Football Education has adequate resources to continue
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, it continues to adopt the going concern basis
in preparing these financial statements. Full details are within note 1 of the financial statements.

Trustees are fully appraised at regular Trustee meetings and between meetings of any issues that impact upon
the management of risk.

Trustees’ Annual Strategic Report (continued)

Reserves policy

The Trustees are aware of the need to hold sufficient unrestricted reserves to enable completion of the educational
programme for all learners on programme. The ESFA income continues to be the largest risk factor for LFE. In
previous years the reserves policy had been to establish reserves target of 40% of prior year income with the
explicit aim of ensuring support was given to all existing learners. During 2018/19 it was agreed that some of the
reserves would be utilised to support the on-programme apprentices and to assist LFE to plan for the rollout of
the delivery of the new SEP standard at Football Clubs across England. Some of the reserves were utilised in that
year and it was agreed that reserves of 25% of the prior year income would then be appropriate. The unrestricted
reserves as at 30‘ June 2024 stand at £2.999m which has just met the target of 25% of prior year income. The
Trustees believe this would be sufficient to ensure support could be provided to all existing learners while allowing
LFE the time necessary to restructure its business model and remain sustainable for the long term, should the
need arise in future.

Objectives and Activities

The Charity's objects ("the Objects") are the advancement of education for the public benefit, in particular, but
not exclusively, for apprentice footballers, professional footballers and retired professional footballers.

Public benefit test

From 1 April 2008 the Charities Act 2006 requires al! charities to meet the legal requirement that its aims are for
the public benefit. The Charity Commission in its “Charities and Public Benefit” guidance states that there are
two key principles to be met to demonstrate that an organisation's aims are for the public benefit: firstly, there
must be an identifiable benefit and secondly, that the benefit must be to the public or a section of the public.
The Trustees have considered this guidance when planning the activities of the charity and this report sets out
the objectives and strategic aims of the charity and its achievements during the year.

LFE provide education to those recruited as potential professional footballers irrespective of their race, religion,
location or prior educational attainment. LFE also provide Post16 education to a wider section of the community
at 15 CCO’s across England, many of these learners come from disadvantaged backgrounds and are often inspired
to continue with their education after school age within a football environment. The Trustees are satisfied that
the aims and objectives of the charity and the activities reported on in this annual report to achieve those aims,
meet these principles.

Achievements and performance .
LFE has key operational targets to achieve each year and these are shown in the tables below:

2023/24
Results

2024/25
Key Targets

Professional Development Phase 2023/24
Football Apprentices Key Targets
Recruitment - Apprentices >600
Retention - Apprentices >95%
SEP — Apprentices through Gateway >90%
SEP - Achievement of all EPA aspects >88%

Although LFE has now seen 17 cohorts of apprentices complete the apprenticeship programme, this was only the
third full cohort of apprentices to complete the SEP Apprenticeship. LFE met or exceeded all four key
apprenticeship targets, as set out above, the highlights of which were retention rates of 97% and overall
achievement rates of the new standard of 95%, these results continue to be outstanding.

LEAGUE FOOTBALL EDUCATION
30 June 2024
Trustees’ annual strategic report and financial statements

Trustees’ Annual Strategic Report (continued)

LFE recruited a higher than the expected number of Post 16 learners during 2023/24 and the retention rate was
below target for the year due to various factors, including some learners choosing not to continue the second
year of their course. The learners that remain committed and stay on programme, achieve their main aim at the
end of their two-year programme. As a result of this LFE has restricted the recruitment at some CCO’s and
implemented a closer management of the recruitment process, ensuring the programme is right for the learner
at the outset.

Ofsted Inspection

In February 2023 LFE was inspected by Ofsted and was again graded ‘Outstanding’ across all key judgements,
including Quality of Education, Behaviour & attitudes, Personal development and Leadership & Management. This
outstanding achievement was reinforced by the successful renewal of both the Investors in People and The Matrix
Standard during the 2022/23 academic year, which are further endorsements of the excellent work LFE carries
out with its learners across both the Apprenticeship and Study Programme.

The Trustees believe that the recent independent reviews alongside the wider programme of audit and checks
conducted within the education sector and the excellent retention and achievement rates provide all stakeholders
with the confidence they require in the governance, management, and delivery mechanisms of LFE.

Related parties

The details of the related party transactions during the year are shown in note 16 of the financial statements.
During the year LFE delivered the training and education of apprentice footballers on behalf of The Football
League Limited and The Professional Footballers’ Association.

LFE is based at EFL House, the Preston office of the EFL, and as such LFE pay the EFL for the rental of office
space together with various associated costs, amounting to £132,200 during the year ending 30" June 2024
compared to £159,144 in 2022/23.

The educational costs of LFE were supported by The Professional Footballers’ Association of £1.642m during the
year ending 30" June 2024.

Plans for future periods

During 2024/25 LFE will continue to embed the delivery of the SEP Apprenticeship and support for the apprentices’
end point assessment on, what is still a relatively new programme. The SEP Apprenticeship Standard was updated
and revised in November 2022 therefore the apprentices that carry over into the 2024/25 year started on the
updated standard, which resulted in further systems changes and developments.

LFE continue to expand the Life skills and Player care offer to all apprentices given that they are training to
perform at the highest level within Football and not all apprentices will achieve this. While doing so, LFE will
endeavour to maintain its excellent position regarding retention and achievement together with developing young
people that are ready for their next stages in life. LFE will continue to work with Professional Football Clubs to
establish different delivery models that suits different employers to ensure the sustainability of the high-quality
education that LFE provide, as recently endorsed by Ofsted.

In addition to the apprenticeship programme LFE has now recruited a further cohort of learners on to the 16-18
study programme within 14 EFL club community organisations (CCO’s) in conjunction with the CEFA Games
Programme. The 2024/25 year will see a reduction in overall learner numbers, due to improved recruitment
processes at the CCO’s, thus setting out the high expectations of the programme from the outset as many Post
16 learners look for alternative educational provision away from the traditional sixth form or college environment.
We will work in partnership with the CCO’s to ensure the aims of the programme meet with the aims and
expectations of LFE and provide a stepping stone at age18 into employment or higher education, inspiring those
‘ school leavers to engage in Post 16 education through the power of football.

Statement of Trustees’ responsibilities

The trustees (who are also directors of League Football Education for the purposes of company law) are
responsible for preparing the Trustees’ Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law
and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

Company law requires the trustees to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true
and fair view of the state of affairs of the charitable company and of the incoming resources and application -
of resources, including the income and expenditure, of the charitable company for that period. In preparing
these financial statements, the trustees are required to:

° select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;

. observe the methods and principles in the Charities SORP (FRS 102);

. make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;

° state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material
departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and

. prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that
the charity will continue in business. :

The trustees are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at
any time the financial position of the charitable company and enable them to ensure that the financial
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the
charitable company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other
irregularities.

In so far as the trustees are aware:

° there is no relevant audit information of which the charitable company’s auditor is unaware; and

° the trustees have taken all steps that they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any
relevant audit information and to establish that the auditor is aware of that information.

The trustees are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information
included on the charitable company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the reparation
and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Trustees’ annual strategic report and financial statements

Independent Auditor's Report to the Members of League Football Education
Opinion :

We have audited the financial statements of League Football Education for the year ended 30 June 2024 which
comprise Statement of Financial Activities, Balance Sheet, Statement of Cash Flows and notes to the financiai
statements, including significant accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that has been. applied in
their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including Financial Reporting
Standard 102 the Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland (United Kingdom
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

In our opinion the financial statements:

° give a true and fair view of the charitable company’s state of affairs as at 30 June 2024 and of its
incoming resources and application of resources, including its income and expenditure, for the year then
ended;

. have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice; and

° have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable
law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit
of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the charitable company in accordance
with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the
FRC's Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these
requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
basis for our opinion.

Conclusions relating to going concern

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the trustees’ use of the going concern basis of
accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or
conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the charitable company's ability to
continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are
authorised for issue.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the trustees with respect to going concern are described in the
relevant sections of this report.

Other information

The trustees are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included
in the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. Our opinion on the
financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in
our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is

materially inconsistent with the financial statements, or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit or

otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material

misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial

statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material
- misstatement of this other information we are required to report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.

Independent Auditor’s Report to the Members of League Football Education
(continued)

Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

. the information given in the Trustees’ Annual Report which includes Directors’ Report and the Strategic
Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the
financial statements; and

. the Trustees’ Annual Report which includes Directors’ Report and the Strategic Report has been prepared.
in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

Matters on which we are required to report by exception

In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the charitable company and its environment obtained in the
course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the Trustees’ Annual Report and Strategic
Report.

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report
to you if, in our opinion:
° adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been
received from branches not visited by us; or
the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
certain disclosures of trustees’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

Responsibilities of trustees

As explained more fully in the Trustees’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 9, the trustees (who are also
directors of the charitable company for the purposes of company law) are responsible for the preparation of the
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as
the trustees determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the trustees are responsible for assessing the charitable company’s ability
to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going
concern basis of accounting unless the trustees either intend to liquidate the charitable company or to cease
operations, or have no realistic alternative to do so.

Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
We have been appointed as auditors under the Companies Act 2006 and report in accordance with regulations
made under that Act.

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures
in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities,
including fraud. The specific procedures for this engagement and the extent to which these are capable of
detecting irregularities, including fraud are detailed below.

LEAGUE FOOTBALL EDUCATION

Trustees’ annual strategic report and financial statements

Independent Auditor’s Report to the Members of League Football Education
(continued)

Identifying and assessing risks related to irregularities:

We assessed the susceptibility of the charitable company’s financial statements to material misstatement and how
fraud might occur, including through discussions with the trustees, discussions within our audit team planning
meeting, updating our record of internal controls and ensuring these controls operated as intended. We evaluated
possible incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the financial statements. We identified laws
and regulations that are of significance in the context of the charitable company by discussions with trustees and
updating our understanding of the sector in which the charitable company operates.

Laws and regulations of direct significance in the context of the charitable company include The Companies Act
2006 and The Charities Act 2011 and guidance issued by the Charity Commission for England and Wales. Further
the charitable company is subject to other laws and regulations where the consequence of non-compliance could
have a material effect on the amount or disclosures in the financial statements, through significant fine, litigation
or restrictions on the charitable company’s operations. We identified the most significant laws and regulations to
be funding rules and guidance issued by the Education and Skills funding Agency (ESFA) and guidance issued by
Department for Education.

Audit response to risks identified:

We considered the extent of compliance with these laws and regulations as part of our audit procedures on the
related financial statement items including a review of financial statement disclosures. We reviewed the charitable
company’s records of breaches of laws and regulations, minutes of meetings and correspondence with relevant
authorities, including the Department for Education, to identify potential material misstatements arising. We
discussed the charitable company’s policies and procedures for compliance with laws and regulations with
members of management responsible for compliance.

During the planning meeting with the audit team, the engagement partner drew attention to the key areas which
might involve non-compliance with laws and regulations or fraud. We enquired of management whether they
were aware of any instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations or knowledge of any actual, suspected
or alleged fraud. We addressed the risk of fraud through management override of controls by testing the
appropriateness of journal entries and identifying any significant transactions that were unusual or outside the
normal course of business. We assessed whether judgements made in making accounting estimates gave rise to
a possible indication of management bias. At the completion stage of the audit, the engagement partner's review
included ensuring that the team had approached their work with appropriate professional scepticism and thus the
capacity to identify non-compliance with laws and regulations and fraud.

There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above and the further removed non-compliance
with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely
we would become aware of it. Also, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than
the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example,
forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion.

Notes to the financial statements
(forming part of the financial statements)

1

Accounting policies

The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are
considered material in relation to the charitable company’s financial statements.

Company status

League Football Education is a charitable company limited by guarantee and does not have a share
capital. The liability of the members is limited but is not to exceed £10 per member.

Basis of preparation

The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting policies set out in the
notes to the accounts and comply with the charity’s governing document, the Companies Act 2006 and
the Charities Act 2011 and Accounting and Reporting by Charities: Statement of Recommended Practice
(effective 1% January 2019) applicable to charities preparing their accounts in accordance with the
Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland (FRS102).

The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis and on a going concern basis.
League Football Education meets the definition of a public benefit entity under FRS 102. Assets and
liabilities are initially recognised at cost or transaction value unless otherwise stated in the relevant
accounting policy notes.

The financial statements are prepared in sterling, which is the functional currency of the charity. Monetary
amounts in these financial statements are rounded to the nearest £1.

Going Concern

League Football Education has prepared cash flow forecasts for a period of 18 months from the date of
approval of these financial statements. After reviewing these forecasts LFE is of the opinion that there
will still be sufficient funds to meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of 12 months from the
date of approval of the financial statements (the going concern assessment period). At the year end, LFE
has reserves of £2.99m including £4.17m in cash and in addition to this LFE has no long-term debt.

The revenue generated by LFE is predominantly driven by the number of elite academy apprentices
recruited by clubs within the EFL with more than 65 of the 72 professional clubs running academies and
recruiting apprentices every year. Although some clubs may choose to recruit slightly fewer apprentices,
the core provision of LFE is retained.

Consequently, LFE is confident that it has sufficient funds to continue to meet its liabilities as they fall
due for at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements and therefore have
prepared the financial statements on a going concern basis.

Fixed assets and depreciation

Depreciation is provided to write off the cost or valuation of tangible fixed assets by equal instalments
over their estimated useful economic lives as follows:

e Motor vehicles 33% per annum

Asset capitalisation policy

Assets are capitalised when all of the following criteria are met:

e Assets purchased have a useful life of one year or more and cost more than £3,000.
Debtors

Debtors include amounts owed to the charity for the provision of goods and services or amounts paid in
advance for the goods and services it will receive.

Debtors also include amounts receivable to which the charity is entitled.

LEAGUE FOOTBALL EDUCATION
. 30 June 2024
Trustees’ annual strategic report and financial statements

Notes (continued)
Income from charitable activities

Income from funding providers, including government departments, is credited to the income and

expenditure account to the extent that the charitable company has provided its services. Where such

incoming resources are received in advance the income is deferred until the charitable company becomes
“ entitled to the resources.

Investment income

Interest receivable on cash balances is credited to the income and expenditure account as it becomes
due.

Resources expended
Expenses are accounted for on an accrual’s basis.

Charitable expenditure includes the direct costs of the activities. Support costs are also incurred to enable
the charitable company to provide these activities.

Operating Lease costs

Charitable expenditure includes the cost of the lease for the rental of the head office premises. These
costs are recognised as an expense of the charity on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.

Pension costs -

The company pays contributions to personal money purchase pension schemes for eligible employees
and accounts for the amount in the income and expenditure on an accruals basis.

Funds

Unrestricted funds are available to spend on activities that further any of the purposes of the charity.
Restricted funds are funds received under a grant agreement and can only be used for a specific purpose.

Creditors and Provisions policy

A provision will be made within the accounting period when the following applies:

e the obligation became due as a result of a past event,

e itis probable that the charity will be required to pay, and

e the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably.

Financial Instruments

The charitable company only has financial assets and liabilities of a kind that qualify as basic financial

instruments. Basic financial instruments are initially recognised at transaction value and are subsequently
recognised at their settlement value.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements

In the application of the charity's accounting policies, the Trustees are required to make judgements,
estimates and assumptions about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily
apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical
experience and other factors considered to be relevant.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting
estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised, if the revision affects only that
period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future
periods. On review, the Trustees do not believe there are any critical accounting estimates and
judgements which could give rise to a material adjustment in the financial statements.
