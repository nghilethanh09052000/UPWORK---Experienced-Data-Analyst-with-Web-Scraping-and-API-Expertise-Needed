STRATEGIC REPORT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2024

INTRODUCTION

The directors present the Strategic Report for Lifetime Training Group (the “Company’) for the year ended 31
July 2024. The Company is part of a Group headed by MTH Midco 2 Limited (the “Group”). Financing and
strategic oversight for the Company is managed by the Group.

The comparative financial statements are based on the 18 month financial period to 31 July 2023 but we have
included 12 month period comparatives for the financials in this report to allow for a year on year comparison.

Group Overview

The Lifetime Group (the “Group”) comprises Lifetime Training Group Ltd (“Lifetime Training’), Skilltech Solutions
Ltd (“Skilltech’), IT Skills Management Company Ltd (“Intequal”) and Innovate Awarding Ltd (“Innovate”). Four .
organisations, united to define the UK's future skills agenda, in skills transformation, in assessment and
awarding, and in education technology.

Our vision for the future is driven by a simple belief: everyone should have the chance to learn the skills that
transform their lives and help them reach their full potential. It's with this shared purpose - and through our
scale, breadth and influence - that the Group is in the strongest position to make this vision a reality, for the
people and businesses across the UK that choose and trust us to transform their futures.

Lifetime Training is the UK’s leading independent training provider and supports 18,000 learners, working with
them and their employers to maximise their potential in their chosen career path. Lifetime delivers apprenticeship
training and commercial courses across a broad range of economic sectors, including Hospitality, Care, Fitness
& Active Leisure, Retail, Healthcare and Leadership & Management. Lifetime’s customer base comprises over
200 large blue chip national organisations who typically have more than 1,000 employees.

Group Vision

Powered by next-level people, leading-edge tech, and limitless ambition, we're creating a world of thriving
culture, diverse talent, transformative learning, social purpose, and unlimited growth. Everything we do today
makes a more skilled, diverse, and sustainable tomorrow, for everyone. Creating tomorrow's workforce starts
today, and it starts with us. We're shaping a world of work that totally transforms people and businesses
. everywhere. .

Our new Group Mission, Vision & Values were created collectively during 2024 with team members’ input
through focus groups and incorporated outputs from our Group culture survey and our EDI survey to ensure
inclusivity was at the heart of everything we do. Our Group business strategy and a strong recognition of our
influence across the UK Skills agenda through our core brands equally informed our new purpose and direction
of travel. :

The Group's vision is about “Creating Tomorrow's Workforce” and our redefined mission is that, “We solve talent
gaps for competitive advantage, transforming learning, skills and enabling social mobility.” Our Values are that
we “Engage, Enable and Enhance” to “make growth happen”. Growth for us is multifaceted; personal growth and
development for our people, career and skills progression for our learners leading to the growth for the
employers our learners work for and, ultimately, growth for UK PLC at large.

STRATEGIC REPORT (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2024

Our Environment, Social, Governance and Impact Commitment

‘Enabling social mobility has always been a north star for the Group, as we enable our learners to achieve their
career goals. Now at the heart of our mission statement, this has informed our emerging ESGI programme
activity in the form of an ESGI strategy. This is because we believe in building a sustainable future—not just for
the businesses and industries we serve, but for the people and communities at the heart of them. As a leader in
delivering high-quality apprenticeship programs, we recognize the profound impact we can make by equipping
individuals with the skills they need to thrive while supporting the broader goals of environmental stewardship,
social progress, and responsible governance.

The strategy centres around; .

1. Environment: Reduction of our environmental footprint

2. Social: Supporting our communities

3. Governance: Demonstrating our responsibilities

4. Increasing our Impact: Our social mobility & philanthropy work

Our ESGI strategy reflects our commitment to creating value beyond the bottom line. It's about aligning our
mission with the evolving priorities of a modern workforce and the global imperative for sustainability. By
embedding ESG principles into our operations, program delivery and assessment and accreditation remit, we
aim to demonstrate that this strategy is not just an add-on to our business—it's a reflection of who we are and
what we stand for. We have estimated our social return on investment (SROI) for 2023-24 to be £112m.

A supporting 3 year roadmap of activities and commitments, mapped to United Nations Social Development
Goals (SDG) has been prepared and will be published in early 2025.

Trading activity for the 12 month period to 31 July 2024

This has been a year of major progress across a broad range of areas. The rightsizing of the business in late
2023 has created financial stability and has transformed our trading performance with a return to profitability and
cash generation. A relentless drive for quality improvements, including the removal of low achieving courses and
the rewriting of the curriculum all contributed to an Ofsted 2 ‘Good’ award in the Spring of 2024. The balance
sheet restructure and release of debt in June 2024 significantly strengthened the net asset position and balance
sheet of the Group, enabling the business to tender on contracts it may previously have been excluded from. Our
relationship with key stakeholder the Education & Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) has been stabilised as historic
matters have been worked through towards resolution. We have also spent the year preparing for a new agenda
from the Labour government with the development of modularised course content and the launch of commercial
Care and Digital courses to meet customer needs and requests.

The underlying performance of the Company is shown in the table below, by reviewing the results on a year on
year basis with comparative figures for the 12 month period ending July 2023. In the Appendix at the end of this
report, we include a reconciliation of the July 2023 financial figures to the 18 month figures included in the
Statement of Comprehensive Income.

Revenue increased by 20% over this period to £53.2m, reflecting the impact of the investment we made into the
business as outlined above, underlying recovery in the sector and price rises achieved. The business operated
in a more favourable trading environment during the period under review, with upward adjustments to the funding
caps on apprenticeship standards starting to come through as part of a market review at the Department for
Education (Dof). Specifically, the rise in Functional Skills funding per aim from £471 to £724 announced and
implemented by the DoE in January 2024. This had a positive impact on Lifetime’s income streams. We also
invested in business development activities and further strengthened our Partnerships team in the period under
review. This has started to deliver enhanced revenues.

Gross profit margins were maintained during the period at 84%, however the Operating result improved.
significantly from a loss of £(16,753)k to a £140k profit with administration expenses reducing by 9% over the
period together with a significant reduction in exceptional expenses. Realignment of the cost base to learner
volumes took place in the period under review. Announced in September 2023 and completed ahead of plan by
1st December, the right--sizing of the back office and support operation to learner volumes resulted in a 6%
reduction in staffing.

Exceptional admin expenses of £0.9m in the current period, relate to restructuring and legal and professional
fees. These were significantly lower than the prior year, which included a funding partner provision of £5m.

LIFETIME TRAINING GROUP LIMITED

STRATEGIC REPORT (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2024

Adjusted EBITDAE is considered to be the most reliable profit measure by the Directors and a good indicator of
the operating cash the business is generating. The year on year improvement of £11.3m from an EBITDAE loss
of £(8.4)m to a EBITDAE profit of £2.9m is testament to the successful turnround of the Company.

All our learner management is now contained within the same Aptem system which has led to leamer
experience, process and control improvements as well as enhanced provision of insightful data and analytics to
manage the business more efficiently. We continue to invest and drive improvements in this area with significant
progress made with regards to learner progression, satisfaction and compliance metrics. The improved visibility
of how and when a learner progresses through their programme means we can further tailor our approach to an
individual's learning needs. :

The structure of quality arrangements and improvements focuses on continuously improving and driving positive
outcomes for learners across all provision within the Company. Strategies across quality, curriculum and
operational teams implemented in July 2023 had a significant positive impact on the volume of learners
achieving their programmes with total achievement rates increasing by 5 percentage points year on year. The
foundations built during this financial year provide a strong framework for this to be enhanced further with
significant improvements forecast for the 2024/25 academic year. In the second half of the financial year
(February to July 2024) we experienced a 45% improvement in learners on track or ahead of their programme, a
66% improvement in learners OTJ (off the job) progress and maintained a 85% learner satisfaction rate
throughout. We expect learner retention and achievement rates to continue improving on the back of this
significant investment in our business.

LIFETIME TRAINING GROUP LIMITED

STRATEGIC REPORT (CONTINUED}
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2024

Balance Sheet and Restructure

The Group’s balance sheet was significantly strengthened in the period. In July 2024, debt of £43.3m was
released by the borrower MTH Bidco Limited (a member of the Group). The Group's debt as a result has
reduced to a £7.5m term loan that is due to mature on 34 July 2027 with no interest payable or accruing. This
recapitalisation of the balance sheet by £43.3m significantly improves the net asset position of the wider Group
and the removal of interest payments on the remaining £7.5m loan will enhance future profitability.

As a consequence of the operational turnaround outlined above, the Group has returned to profitability and has
therefore recognised a deferred tax asset on the balance sheet of £1.25m. .

The consolidated Group's net asset position (as per MTH Midco Limited accounts) is reported at £18.6m as at
July 2024 compared to £(25.2)m as at July 2023.

Natwest

The only other remaining debt in the Group (again, held at MTH Bidco Limited) is the balance of a drawn
Revolving Credit Facility of £1.5m. This debt has reduced to ENIL post balance sheet date following post-year
end repayments.

Ofsted

The Company underwent a full Ofsted inspection in May 2024 and we were pleased that the significant focus
and investment in quality improvements was recognised with the award of a ‘Good’ rating. We would like to
acknowledge the work of our fantastic team right across the organisation in meeting this important milestone.
The final Ofsted report highlighted numerous activities that Lifetime does well, such as:
« “the new leadership team has taken swift and effective actions to improve the quality of apprentices’
education and training”
“Apprentices study content that is current and relevant to their industry”
“Learning coaches have designed training that is sequenced so that apprentices can build on previous
learning and develop the new knowledge and skills they need”
e “Board members set high expectations for leaders and managers. They monitor closely the impact of any
actions taken. As a result, the pace of improvement has increased significantly and the positive impact on
the quality of provision is evident”.

STRATEGIC REPORT (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2024

Funding Partner Liability

No change has been made to the £5m funding partner provision relating to historic trading periods in Lifetime as
this is still considered appropriate by the Directors. To conclude the constructive discussions to date and
determine a final repayment figure, further audit work is required on specific sample data and we expect this to
occur shortly. The Funding Partner has agreed that any liability arising will be subject to a mutually agreed
repayment plan in order to protect the working capital of the Company and the wider Group.

Post Balance Sheet Period

The Company has budgeted for a further improvement in its operations in 2024/25 and, at the time of writing, the
Group is tracking its financial targets as well as generating positive cash flows.

The current trading outlook is positive and the Company continues to win new business, such as recently
concluded learner contracts with Nando’s and Amazon. In addition, there has been significant expansion in
learner volumes in a number of our longstanding contracts, such as with Tesco and Mitchells & Butler. We
continue to work with our key partners on programme enhancements and new programmes to reflect changes
and demand from UK PLC, and to this end have launched two Care programmes dedicated to those ineligible for
apprenticeship funding, and are about to launch a suite of leadership modules to match the skills gaps of our
partners across all sectors. As part of our annual curriculum enhancement programme, we plan to improve over
50% of our existing programmes to ensure we remain relevant to the skills required as customer trends and
demands evolve. We are also underway in developing foundation programmes recently announced by Skills
England to further support entry-level learners into work.

The impact of the Autumn 2024 budget is still being worked through. Notwithstanding the increase in Employers’
NIC from April 2025, the budget should increase the financial attractiveness to recruit under 25 year olds carrying
out a formal apprenticeship which should prove a longer term benefit for the Group.

The government change in July 2024 was followed by the announcement of the skills review within Further
Education (FE) and the formation of Skills England to act as an oversight body for the skills network. This
announcement presents welcome growth and diversification opportunities that were not available under the
previous government.

Following its inception, Skills England is being established to review the core principles of apprenticeship delivery

and apprenticeship levy flexibilities. This consultation puts Lifetime Group in a position where we can advise,

inform and influence the trajectory of the FE landscape that will be realised over the next 10 years. At the heart

of this are 3 core elements of adaptation which we support:

e The need to have a more flexible approach to levy spend to allow for the introduction of shorter, vocationally
centric programmes to support skills gaps

e The need to review regulatory constraints within existing apprenticeship structures such as functional skill
delivery and minimum programme durations

e The need to introduce foundation level apprenticeships to support individuals in the early stages of their
careers

This diversification of the FE sector and funding opportunities that arise provide an opportunity to ensure more
learners have access to the funding they need to support their careers; moreover, the changes proposed are in
markets where Lifetime Group are well established leaders.

Apprenticeship programmes delivered within Lifetime Training Group are governed and overseen by the Institute
for Apprenticeships and Technical Education (IFATE). IFATE was created in 2017 as an arm's length body of the
Department for Education (DofE) and has recently been absorbed in 2024 into the remit of Skills England. IFATE
work with employers and providers to review learning criteria within apprenticeships and shape skills training in
England for the future of the workforce. As part of IFATE’s continuous review process a number of
apprenticeship standards’ under the Group's offering have undertaken formal review over the last 18 months,
with 90% of the reviewed programmes benefiting from a funding increase. These funding increases are applied
to reflect the current economic climate and the increased direct costs of delivery that are supported by the
provider. FATE continue to announce widespread apprenticeship standard reviews, with 18 further programmes
being scoped for re-imptementation over the course of 2025. As part of the review process, current funding rates
will be evaluated and are anticipated to have increases supported.

LIFETIME TRAINING GROUP LIMITED

STRATEGIC REPORT (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2024

Activities taken during the period under review, particularly the positive Ofsted result and the recapitalisation of
the Group’s balance sheet, provide us with confidence on the immediate outlook for the Company and the wider
Group as well as the longer term potential to drive value for our learners, staff and shareholder. ,

This positive outlook was reinforced at a highly successful and well received Group-wide staff conference
“Creating Tomorrow” held in October 2024 at which the Group's updated Mission, Vision and Values were
announced together with our emerging Environmental, Social, Governance and Impact (ESGI) Strategy.

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
The directors consider the following to be the principal risks and uncertainties for the Company:

Government Policy Risk - the largest part of the Company's turnover is derived from training activities influenced
and in part funded by government sources. Changes to the UK Government and/or policy in respect of education
and training is the primary risk facing the Company. In addition, the Company relies on the employers it works
with to continue to operate, employ incumbent staff and recruit new employees. Changes to the UK economy
driven by Government policy are a notable risk.

Regulatory Risk — the Directors maintain an up-to-date knowledge of general regulatory risks associated with the
sector in which the company operates. General regulatory frameworks include, but are not limited to, those in the
areas of Health & Safety, Employment law and Data Protection law. Risk is managed through the adoption of
policies and procedures that address each area.

The Companys principal financial instruments comprise bank balances, trade creditors & debtors and loans to &
from other companies in the Group. The main purpose of these financial assets and liabilities is to provide
finance for the company’s operations. The main risks the Company is exposed to are price risk, credit risk,
liquidity risk and interest rate risk.

Price Risk — the Company is exposed to price risk arising from its operations. The Directors closely monitor
changes to process across its markets and react appropriately to such changes on a timely basis where deemed
appropriate. This would include price changes enforced by legislative changes by the government.

Credit risk - the principal trade debtor of the Company is the Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA)
although there is an onward risk whereby we require the employer partners that we work with to pay their
apprenticeship levy to allow the ESFA to release much of the funding to us. The Company ensures that it is
following the requirements as laid out in the contract between the company and ESFA to ensure credit risk is
managed. For all other trade debtors there is close monitoring of all outstanding amounts.

Liquidity risk - the Company's finances are monitored by the directors on a continuous basis. Detailed monthly
management accounts including cash flows provide the Directors with the information they require to manage
liquidity risk. Daily cash flow forecasting and monitoring is also produced to further support the Directors in the
management of liquidity risk. Medium- and long-term financial plans which include cash flows are regularly
produced and monitored by the Directors.

Interest rate risk - the company has both interest bearing assets and liabilities. Interest bearing liabilities of the

business are predominantly long-term loans. Interest bearing assets comprise cash balances which earn interest
at a variable rate.

FINANCIAL KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS

The performance of the business is monitored at various levels from overall company performance down to
individual business operating unit and individual teams. Detailed management financial statements are produced
monthly with the appropriate information being distributed to the appropriate teams and individuals. The key.
financial performance measures considered by the Directors and wider management team are turnover, gross
profit margin and operating profit.

Cash flow performance and the associated balance sheet positions are also closely monitored. Detailed cash
flow performance, including identification of working capital movements, capital expenditure, taxation and debt
servicing are reviewed with projections of future trading periods also contained within the management reporting.

There are many non-financial key performance indicators monitored by the business, either on a daily, weekly or
monthly basis. These include, but are not limited to, coach activity levels, learner volumes, learner enrolment
volumes, timeliness of learner progression, learner achievement rates, the quality of teaching provision and both
learner and client satisfaction.

STRATEGIC REPORT (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2024

DIRECTORS’ STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH DUTY TO PROMOTE THE SUCCESS OF THE
COMPANY

The Board carefully considers the diverse and far-ranging interest, needs and priorities of each stakeholder
group in it's decision making, whilst securing long term business sustainability. This is achieved through direct
engagement along with regularly capturing and reviewing available feedback, reports, updates and data.

Our directors consider the following groups as our key stakeholders;

- Employer partners (customers)

- Learners (customers)

- Our People (workforce)

- Investors

: Suppliers

- Communities and environment (society)
- OFSTED

- ESFA/DoE

The duty of the Board to act in good faith and in the interests of our stakeholders is set out in Section 172 (1) (a)
to (f) of the Companies Act 2006.

Examples of where the Board observed their s.172 duty for this reporting year includes;
a) the likely consequences of any decisions in the long term;

This has been exemplified through the creation of the new Three-Year strategic plan. Furthermore, each year an
annual plan and associated strategies are produced and assessed with the shareholder. This includes a forward-
looking assessment on a multi-year basis to identify the long-term impacts of the strategic actions being
proposed. This will include the assessment of risks and opportunities associated with those proposals. All senior
management are required to contribute to such plans and they are presented formally for assessment by the
Directors to the shareholder.

b) the interests of the Group’s employees;

” This has been exemplified through extensive listening over the past 12 months through our employee forum and
other open lines of communication across the Group, leading to the creation of a new Mission, Vision & Values,
which are closely aligned to the business’s long term ambitions; we have also invested in our employees benefits
packages. The creation of a new internal Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Strategy with supporting goals and
targets further ensures that we attract, retain and invest in our talented employees, achieving both individual
employee career success and long term business success. Our annual staff appraisal process ‘Evolve’ is
supplemented by ongoing performance reviews and talent mapping exercises as part of our day-to-day
operations.

Attrition across the Group dropped significantly during the reporting year, from 23% in August 2023 to 15% in
July 2024. This was achieved through significant work around the engagement and retention of our people. The
impact of this focus is evidenced through our Engagement survey scores which increased from 73% Group
Engagement in August 2023 to 87% Engagement in July 2024.

c) the need to foster the Group’s business relationships with suppliers, customers and regulators;

Our client partners are principally UK apprenticeship levy paying employers. It is important to us to develop and
maintain strong relationships through regular engagement and to enter mutually beneficial multi-year contracts.
We also place strong value on a supportive and consistent supplier base and look to enter multi-year contracts
with our critical suppliers. We further recognise that critical partners in our industry are the UK Government,
principally via the Department for Education's executive agency the Education Skills Funding Agency with who
we engage in regular formal quarterly meetings. Other critical partners include Ofqual and Ofsted. We look to
actively engage with and support these partners to understand the operational framework in which we are
required to operate.

LIFETIME TRAINING GROUP LIMITED

STRATEGIC REPORT (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2024

d) the impact of the Group’s operations on the community and the environment;

As exemplified through our long term partnership with Coach Core, a charity devoted to training and securing
employment for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds. This, coupled with the social impact reporting
provided for our key employer partners (customers) helps to influence and raise the profile of the apprenticeship
sector's important role in advancing social mobility.

Furthermore, whilst the business has reported on carbon neutral targets for some time, the Three-Year strategic
plan sees a further heightened focus on Environmental, Social and Governance, including the commencement of
work around the creation of an ESG Report and Strategy this year.

As highlighted in our Strategic Report on page 2, we have estimated our social return on investment (SROI) for
2023-24 to be £112m.

e} the reputation for a high standard of business conduct; and
f) the need to act fairly as between members of the Group.

Both of which are exemplified through the onboarding of a new Chairman and the introduction of an external
Quality expert to advise the Board on Quality. An Audit & Risk Committee has also been created and a full
review of all company codes and policies has been completed. The Directors meet formally with the shareholder
monthly, but equally strive to keep all informed of notable developments as and when they arise. Annual reviews
of strategies and plans, which include financial budgets, are assessed collectively in detail with the shareholder
as appropriate. The Directors ensure that appropriate policies are in place to provide a framework within which
we ensure the business and our representatives operate. We are responsive to changes in legislative and ethical
aspects of what would constitute good business governance. Included in this framework is detailed guidance to
employees in respect of Anti-Corruption and Bribery, Whistleblowing, Safeguarding, Code of Conduct, Prevent
Awareness and Modern Slavery.

This report was approved by the board and signed on its behalf.

DIRECTORS' REPORT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2024

The directors present their report and the financial statements for the year ended 31 July 2024.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2024

STREAMLINED ENERGY AND CARBON REPORT
UK energy use and Greenhous gas (GHG) emissions
The tables below detail the energy used by Lifetime during the financial period ending 31 July 2024 in the

business activities involving the combustion of gas and fuels, the purchase of electricity and business mileage in
both kWh and tCO2e. They also detail the total energy and emissions by scope and as a total.

Scope Energy Usage Measurement GHG Emissions Measurement
Unit Unit
Scope 1 99,002 Kwh 38 tCO2e
Scope 2 82,195 Kwh 17 tCO2e
Scope 3 2,550,940 Kwh 987 -tCO2e
2,732,137 Kwh 1,043 tCO2e

See comparatives for the 18 month period ending 31 July 2023 below:

Scope Energy Usage Measurement GHG Emissions Measurement
Unit Unit
Scope 1 650 955 Kwh 34 t CO2e
Scope 2 ; 166.639 Kwh 174 t CO2e
Scope 3 4.844.098 Kwh 4.293 t CO2e
5,661,592 Kwh 1.501 1CO2e
Intensity Ratio

To convert absolute emissions to an emissions intensity metric, the business has calculated emissions per a
relevant unit of measure. An intensity ratio is a way of defining the company’s emissions data in relation to an
appropriate business metric. This allows comparison of energy efficiency performance over time and with other
similar types of organisations. SECR Intensity ratios are calculated by dividing the companies’ emissions by its
organisation-specific metric. In the case of the company the metric chosen to normalise its emissions is based
on the average number of employees. This metric is chosen as the principal area of energy usage is in respect
of travel, with relatively low levels of energy usage associated with the business premises. The intensity ratio for
the period is 1,276kg CO2e per employee.

Energy Efficiency Actions

During the period the business reduced it predominantly diesel fleet from 97 vehicles to 4. The intention is to
offer employees access to an electric vehicle via a salary sacrifice leasing scheme.

Lifetime Training head office utilises 100% renewable energy.

A specialist Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) consultancy firm was officially appointed late FY24 to
formalise the company ESG strategy going forward. Setting achievable targets as the company aims to become
a leader in the Education sector in respect of reducing its carbon footprint.

The business will continue to utilise online methods of delivery wherever governance guidelines allow keeping
business travel to a minimum.

Methodology used

Data for this report has been provided as follows:

e Fleet ~ from telematics devices fitted to company cars, support by fuel card invoices, with employee
declarations as to business and private mileages.

« Fuel reimbursed — employee expense claims for business mileage

Conversion factors to report energy usage in both measurements noted in the previous tables were identified

from the ‘UK Government GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting’ for 2024 as published by the

Department for Energy Security and Net Zero.

DIRECTORS' RESPONSIBILITIES STATEMENT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2024

The directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic report, the Directors’ report and the financial statements
in accordance with applicable law and regulations.

Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the
directors have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice), including Financial Reporting
Standard 102 ‘The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland’. Under company
law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair
view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period.

In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:

. select suitable accounting policies for the Company's financial statements and then apply them

consistently;

° make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;

. state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures
disclosed and explained in the financial statements;

. prepare the financial statements on the going concem basis unless it Is inappropriate to presume that the

Company will continue in business.

The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain
the Company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the
Company and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They
are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. .

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF LIFETIME TRAINING GROUP LIMITED

OPINION

We have audited the financial statements of Lifetime Training Group Limited (the ‘Company’) for the year ended
31 July 2024, which comprise the Statement of comprehensive income, the Statement of financial position, the
Statement of changes in equity and the related notes, including a summary of significant accounting policies.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United
Kingdom Accounting Standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 102 ‘The Financial Reporting Standard
applicable in the UK and Republic of lreland' (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

{n our opinion the financial statements:
° give a true and fair view of the state of the Company's affairs as at 31 July 2024 and of its profit for the

year then ended;
have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting

Practice; and .
° have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
BASIS FOR OPINION

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable

law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit

of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the

ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the United Kingdom, including

the Financial Reporting Council's Ethical Standard and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in

accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and
* appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

CONCLUSIONS RELATING TO GOING CONCERN

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of
accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or
conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a
going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the
relevant sections of this report. _

OTHER INFORMATION

The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report other than the financial
statements and our Auditors’ report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained
within the Annual Report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and,
except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion
thereon. Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other
information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the
audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent
material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the
financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material
misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.

LIFETIME TRAINING GROUP LIMITED

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF LIFETIME TRAINING GROUP LIMITED
(CONTINUED)

AUDITORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an Auditors’ report that includes our
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures
in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities,
including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is
detailed below: ,

We have considered the nature of the industry and sector, control environment, and business performance;

We have considered the results of enquiries with management and the directors in relation to their own

identification and assessment of the risks of irregularities within the entity; ,

e We have reviewed the documentation of key processes and controls and performed walkthroughs of

transactions to confirm that the systems are operating effectively, in line with documentation;

° Identifying, evaluating and complying with laws and regulations and whether they were aware of any
instances of non-compliance,

° Detecting and responding to the risk of fraud and whether they have knowledge of actual, suspected or
alleged fraud; and,

° The internals controls established to mitigate the risk of fraud or non-compliance with laws and
regulations

As a result of these procedures, we have considered the opportunities and incentives that may exist within the
organisation for fraud and identified the highest area of risk to be in relation to revenue recognition.

_ In common with all audits under ISAs (UK) we are also required to perform specific procedures to respond to the
tisk of management override.

We have also obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that the Company operates in,
focusing on provisions of those laws and regulations that had a direct effect on the determination of material
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The key laws and regulations we considered in this context
included the UK Companies Act, FRS 102 and UK tax legislation.

In addition, we considered provisions of other laws and regulations that do not have a direct effect on the

financial statements but compliance with which may be fundamental to the Company's ability to operate or avoid
a material penalty. These included health and safety regulations, employment law, safeguarding and GDPR.

LIFETIME TRAINING GROUP LIMITED

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF LIFETIME TRAINING GROUP LIMITED
(CONTINUED)

Our procedures to respond to risks identified included the following:

e Reviewing the financial statement disclosures and testing to supporting documentation to assess compliance
with provisions of relevant laws and regulations described as having a direct effect on the financial
statements;

Enquiring of management in relation to actual and potential claims or litigation;

Performing analytical procedures to identify unusual or unexpected relationships that may indicate risks of
material misstatement due to fraud;

Reviewing board meeting minutes;

Performing detailed testing in relation to the recognition of revenue; and

In addressing the risk of fraud through management override of controls, testing the appropriateness of
journal entries and other adjustments; assessing whether the judgments made in accounting estimates are
indicative of potential bias; and evaluating the business rationale of significant transactions that are unusual
or outside the normal course of business.

We also communicated relevant identified laws and regulations and potential fraud risks to all engagement team
members and remained alert to any indications of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations throughout
the audit.

Our audit procedures were designed to respond to risks of material misstatement in the financial statements,
recognising that the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not
detecting one resulting from an error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery,
misrepresentations or through collusion. There are inherent {imitations in the audit procedures performed and the
further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the
financial statements, the less likely we would become aware of it.

Because of the inherent limitations of an audit, there is a risk that we will not detect all irregularities, including
those leading to a material misstatement in the financial statements or non-compliance with regulation. This risk
increases the more that compliance with a law or regulation is removed from the events and transactions
reflected in the financial statements, as we will be less likely to become aware of instances of non-compliance.
The risk is also greater regarding irregularities occurring due to fraud rather than error, as fraud involves
intentional concealment, forgery, collusion, omission or misrepresentation. -

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial
Reporting Council's website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our
Auditors’ report.

1. GENERAL INFORMATION

The principal activity of Lifetime Training Group Limited (the "Company’) is that of training services, of

The Company is a private company limited by shares and is registered, incorporated and domiciled in
England. The address of its registered office is Clifton Heights, Triangle West, Bristol, Avon, BS8 1EJ.

The Company has prepared accounts for the 12 month period ended 31 July 2024, with the previous

BASIS OF PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention unless otherwise
specified within these accounting policies and in accordance with Financia! Reporting Standard 102,
the Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and the Republic of Ireland and the
Companies Act 2006.

The preparation of financial statements in compliance with FRS 102 requires the use of certain
critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise judgement in applying the
Company's accounting policies (see note 3).

The following principal accounting policies have been applied:
FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARD 102 - REDUCED DISCLOSURE EXEMPTIONS

financial statements, as permitted by the FRS 102 "The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in
the UK and Republic of Ireland":

e the requirements of Section 7 Statement of Cash Flows;
. the requirements-of Section 3 Financial Statement Presentation paragraph 3.17(d);

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2024

2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.4 GOING CONCERN

The company is part of a “Group” headed by MTH Midco 2 Limited. Treasury management is
undertaken on a Group wide basis. All operating companies within this Group, have undertaken to
provide support to each other as may be required. The directors consider the going concern position
of the Company from the perspective of the Group, and on that Group basis the directors have
prepared forecasts for a period of 36 months which show that they anticipate the Group will be able
to operate within its forecast available working capital.

The relevant lenders have confirmed that they will support the Group to meet its financial obligations
as they become due for at least the next 15 months from the date of approval of these financial
statements. The directors also note the following matters relating to other companies within the
Group when considering the going concern accounting policy.

1. The company is currently negotiating a settlement for a matter relating to a funding agency (the
“Funding Partner’). For any such settlement that may be agreed, the Funding Partner has stated that
they will discuss a payment plan that is affordable for the company concerned whilst being timely for
the Funding Partner. The company and thus the Group therefore anticipate that once this matter is
resolved, the related cash outflows will be agreed and structured on a basis that can be met from the
Group's working capital without jeopardising the Group’s ability to operate as a going concern for at
least 15 months from the date of approval of these financial statements.

2. The Group has undertaken various operational reviews, and its forecasts include various
assumptions around revenue growth and cost reduction. The directors consider these to be
reasonable and achievable. The cash flow forecasts contain sufficient headroom to tolerate a
reasonable downside scenario.

The directors have reviewed the current and projected financial position of the Group and have a
teasonable expectation that the Group will have adequate resources to continue in operational
existence for a period of at least 15 months from the date of approval of these financial statements.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concem basis in preparing these financial statements.

On the basis of the above, the Directors have concluded that it is appropriate to continue to use the
going concern basis of preparation.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Functional and presentation currency

The Company's functional and presentational currency is GBP.
Transactions and balances

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the spot exchange
tates at the dates of the transactions.

At each period end foreign currency monetary items are translated using the closing rate. Non-
monetary items measured at historical cost are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the
transaction and non-monetary items measured at fair value are measured using the exchange rate
when fair value was determined.

Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of transactions and from the -
translation at period-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are recognised in profit or loss except when deferred in other comprehensive income as
qualifying cash flow hedges.

Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings and cash and cash equivalents are
presented in the Statement of comprehensive income within ‘finance income or costs’. All other
foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in profit or loss within ‘other operating income’.

REVENUE

Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the
Company and the revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is measured as the fair value of the
consideration received or receivable, excluding discounts, rebates, value added tax and other sales
taxes. The following criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised:

Rendering of services
Revenue from a contract to provide services is recognised in the period in which the services are

provided in accordance with the stage of completion of the contract when all of the following
conditions are satisfied: .

° the amount of revenue can be measured reliably;
. it is probable that the Company will receive the consideration due under the contract;
° the stage of completion of the contract at the end of the reporting period can be measured

reliably; and
. the costs incurred and the costs to complete the contract can be measured reliably.
Revenue is recognised in line with the apprentice’s progression up to the apprentice reaching the end
point assessment stage, at which point the apprenticeship revenue becomes non-refundable and
therefore is recognised accordingly.
OPERATING LEASES: THE COMPANY AS LESSEE

Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to profit or loss on a straightline basis over the
lease term.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

tn the research phase of an internal project it is not possible to demonstrate that the project will
generate future economic benefits and hence all expenditure on research shall be recognised as an
expense when it is incurred. Intangible assets are recognised from the development phase of a
project if and only if certain specific criteria are met in order to demonstrate the asset will generate
probable future economic benefits and that its cost can be reliably measured. The capitalised
development costs are subsequently amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic
lives, which range from 3 to 6 years.

If it is not possible to distinguish between the research phase and the development phase of an
internal project, the expenditure is treated as if it were all incurred in the research phase only.

GOVERNMENT GRANTS

Grants are accounted under the accruals model as permitted by FRS 102. Grants relating to
expenditure on tangible fixed assets are credited to profit or loss at the same rate as the depreciation
on the assets to which the grant relates. The deferred element of grants is included in creditors as
deferred income.

Grants of a revenue nature are recognised in the Statement of comprehensive income in the same
period as the related expenditure.

2.10 INTEREST INCOME

Interest income is recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method.

2.11 FINANCE COSTS

Finance costs are charged to profit or loss over the term of the debt using the effective interest
method so that the amount charged is at a constant rate on the carrying amount. Issue costs are
initially recognised as a reduction in the proceeds of the associated capital instrument.

2.12 PENSIONS

DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PENSION PLAN

The Company operates a defined contribution plan for its employees. A defined contribution plan is a
pension plan under which the Company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. Once the
contributions have been paid the Company has no further payment obligations.

The contributions are recognised as an expense in profit or loss when they fall due. Amounts not paid

are shown in accruals as a liability in the Statement of financial position. The assets of the plan are
held separately from the Company in independently administered funds.

2.13 CURRENT AND DEFERRED TAXATION

The tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in profit or loss
except that a charge attributable to an item of income and expense recognised as other
comprehensive income or to an item recognised directly in equity is also recognised in other
comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.

The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of tax rates and laws that have been
enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date in the countries where the Company operates
and generates income.

Deferred tax balances are recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not
reversed by the reporting date, except that:

° The recognition of deferred tax assets is limited to the extent that it is probable that they will be
recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits; and

° Any deferred tax balances are reversed if and when all conditions for retaining associated tax
allowances have been met.

Deferred tax balances are not recognised in respect of permanent differences except in respect of
business combinations, when deferred tax is recognised on the differences between the fair values of
assets acquired and the future tax deductions available for them and the differences between the fair
values of liabilities acquired and the amount that will be assessed for tax. Deferred tax is determined
using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.

2.14 EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS

Exceptional items are transactions that fall within the ordinary activities of the Company but are
presented separately due to their size or incidence.

2.15 INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the difference between amounts paid on the cost of a business combination and
the acquirer's interest in the fair value of its identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquiree at the daft
of acquisition. Subsequent to initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated
amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is amortised on a straight line basis to the
Statement of Comprehensive Income over its useful economic life.
Other intangible assets
Intangible assets are initially recognised at cost. After recognition, under the cost model, intangible
assets are measured at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment
losses.

All intangible assets-are considered to have a finite useful life. If a reliable estimate of the useful life
cannot be made, the useful life shall not exceed ten years.

2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.16 TANGIBLE FIXED ASSETS

Tangible fixed assets under the cost model are stated at historical cost less accumulated
depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Historical cost includes expenditure that is
directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of
operating in the manner intended by management.

The Company adds to the carrying amount of an item of fixed assets the cost of replacing part of
such an item when that cost is incurred, if the replacement part is expected to provide incremental
future benefits to the Company. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. Repairs
and maintenance are charged to profit or loss during the period in which they are incurred.

Depreciation is charged so as to allocate the cost of assets less their residual value over their
estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method.

Depreciation is provided on the following basis:

Office equipment - 20% straight line
Computer equipment - 33% straight line
Other fixed assets - 33% straight line

The assets’ residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted
prospectively if appropriate, or if there is an indication of a significant change since the last reporting
date.

Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount
and are recognised in profit or loss.

2.17 VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS
Investments in subsidiaries are measured at cost less accumulated impairment.
Investments in unlisted Company shares, whose market value can be reliably determined, are
remeasured to market value at each reporting date. Gains and losses on remeasurement are
recognised in the Statement of comprehensive income for the period. Where market value cannot be
reliably determined, such investments are stated at historic cost less impairment.

Investments in listed company shares are remeasured to market value at each reporting date. Gains
and losses on remeasurement are recognised in profit or loss for the period.

2.18 DEBTORS

Short-term debtors are measured at transaction price, less any impairment. Loans receivable are
measured initially at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are measured subsequently at amortised
cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment.

2.19 CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash is represented by cash in hand and deposits with financial institutions repayable without penalty
on notice of not more than 24 hours. Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments that mature in no

more than three months from the date of acquisition and that are readily convertible to known
amounts of cash with insignificant risk of change in value.

2.20 CREDITORS

Short-term creditors are measured at the transaction price. Other financial liabilities, including bank
loans, are measured initially at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are measured subsequently at
amortised cost using the effective interest method.

2.21 PROVISIONS FOR LIABILITIES

Provisions are recognised when an event has taken place that gives rise to a legal or constructive
obligation, a transfer of economic benefits is probable and a reliable estimate can be made.

Provisions are measured as the best estimate of the amount required to settle the obligation, taking
into account the related risks and uncertainties.

Increases in provisions are generally charged as an expense to profit or loss.
2.22 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The Company has elected to apply the provisions of Section 11 “Basic Financial Instruments” of FRS
102 to all of its financial instruments.

Financial instruments are recognised in the Company's Statement of financial position when the
Company becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

Financial assets and liabilities are offset, with the net amounts presented in the financial statements,
when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to
settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Basic financial assets

Basic financial assets, which include trade and other debtors, cash and bank balances, are initially
measured at their transaction price (adjusted for transaction costs except in the initial measurement-
of financial assets that are subsequently measured at fair value through profit and loss) and are
subsequently carried at their amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any provision for
impairment, unless the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where the transaction is
measured at the present value of the future receipts discounted at a market rate of interest.

Discounting is omitted where the effect of discounting is immaterial. The Company's cash and cash
equivalents, trade and most other debtors due with the operating cycle fall into this category of
financial instruments.

Other financial assets

Other financial assets, which includes investments in equity instruments which are not classified as
subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures, are initially measured at fair value, which is normally the
recognised transaction price. Such assets are subsequently measured at fair value with the changes
in fair value being recognised in the profit or loss. Where other financial assets are not publicly
traded, hence their fair value cannot be measured reliably, they are measured at cost less
impairment.

Impairment of financial assets
At the end of each reporting period financial assets measured at amortised cost are assessed for
objective evidence of impairment. If an asset is impaired the impairment loss is the difference

between the carrying amount and the present value of the estimated cash flows discounted at the
asset's original effective interest rate. The impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

2.22 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)

Financial assets are impaired when events, subsequent to their initial recognition, indicate the
estimated future cash flows derived from the financial asset(s) have been adversely impacted. The
impairment loss will be the difference between the current carrying amount and the present value of
the future cash flows at the asset(s) original effective interest rate.

If there is a favourable change in relation to the events surrounding the impairment loss then the
impairment can be reviewed for possible reversal. The reversal will not cause the current carrying
amount to exceed the original carrying amount had the impairment not been recognised. The
impairment reversal is recognised in the profit or loss.

Financial liabilities

Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual
arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in
the assets of the Company after the deduction of all its liabilities.

Basic financial liabilities, which include trade and other creditors, bank loans and other loans are
initially measured at their transaction price (adjusting for transaction costs except in the initial
measurement of financial liabilities that are subsequently measured at fair value through profit and
loss). When this constitutes a financing transaction, whereby the debt instrument is measured at the-
present value of the future payments discounted at a market rate of interest, discounting is omitted
where the effect of discounting is immaterial.

Debt instruments are subsequently carried at their amortised cost using the effective interest rate
method.

Trade creditors are obligations to pay for goods and services that have been acquired in the ordinary
course of business from suppliers. Trade creditors are classified as current liabilities if the payment is
due within one year. If not, they represent non-current liabilities. Trade creditors are initially
recognised at their transaction price and subsequently are measured at amortised cost using the
effective interest method. Discounting is omitted where the effect of discounting is immaterial.

Derecognition of financial assets

Financial assets are derecognised when their contractual right to future cash flow expire, or are
settled, or when the Company transfers the asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership to another party. If significant risks and rewards of ownership are retained after the
transfer to another party, then the Company will continue to recognise the value of the portion of the
risks and rewards retained.

Derecognition of financial liabilities

Financial liabilities are derecognised when the Company's contractual obligations expire or are
discharged or cancelled.

2.23 DIVIDENDS
Equity dividends are recognised when they become fegally payable. Interim equity dividends are
recognised when paid. Final equity dividends are recognised when approved by the shareholders at
an annual general meeting.

A dividend in specie arises when a transaction occurs which in substance is akin to a distribution.
The transaction is recognised in the as a movement through the profit and loss reserve.

JUDGEMENTS IN APPLYING ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION
UNCERTAINTY

The Company makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting
estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that
have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
within the next financial year are addressed below:

Leaver provision
The Company makes an estimate of income claimed in respect of leavers that become apparent post
period end. The estimate is based on experience from previous years.

Bad debt provision

The Company makes an estimate of bad debt. As the majority of the Company's income is received from
Government bodies, the risk of bad debt is restricted to commercial income only. The Company calculates
an estimate based on the actual overdue status of each individual debt outstanding at the period end
using the same methodology applied in previous accounting periods.

Development costs

The Company makes an estimate of the time taken by staff in developing courses and materials what will
be used by the Company to deliver services in the future. The costs relating to such time is capitalised as
intangible development cost assets.

Useful economic life of intangible assets

The Company makes an estimate on the useful economic life of intangible assets. As the intangible
assets relates to curriculum materials used in the delivery of apprenticeship course. The Company has
assigned a useful economic life over the average time of a course.

Funding Partner Provision

The Company makes an estimate based on conditions identified and agreed with the funding partner that
the Company was to refund certain learner Student Loan Company accounts for training income
previously received.

intercompany debtor and investment recovery :

The Director's consider the forecasts of the Company, and the Group, of which it is a part of, to assess
recoverability of these balances.

Deferred tax asset

The Group recognises a deferred tax asset in relation to corporation tax losses which it expects will be
utilised against future profits, in so far as those profits are considered to be reasonably certain.
TURNOVER

The whole of the turnover is attributable to the Company's principal activity.

All turnover arose within the United Kingdom.

No change has been made to the £5m funding partner provision relating to historic trading periods as this
is still considered appropriate by the Directors. To conclude the constructive discussions to date and
determine a final repayment figure, further audit work is required on specific samples and we expect this
to occur shortly. There therefore remains some uncertainty as to the final financial value as the
settlement is subject to some final negotiations and audit work; we believe the liability could change by c
20%. The Funding Partner has agreed that any liability arising will be subject to a mutually agreed
repayment plan in order to protect the working capital of the Group.

The charge in year relates to the recognition of a dilapidation provision in relation to the Company's office
lease.
