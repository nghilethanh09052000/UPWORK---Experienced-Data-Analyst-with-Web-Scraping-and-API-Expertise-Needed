TRUSTEES' REPORT (INCLUDING DIRECTORS' REPORT)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2024

The Trustees present their annual report and financial statements for the year ended 31 July 2024.

The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting policies set out in note 1 to the
financial statements and comply with the Charity's deed of trust, the Companies Act 2006 and "Accounting and
Reporting by Charities: Statement of Recommended Practice applicable to charities preparing their accounts in
accordance with the Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland (FRS 102) (effective

Objectives and activities

Contracts

The Charity continues to be on the Register of Approved Training Providers (RoATP) for the delivery of
Apprenticeships and contracts directly with employers to deliver this provision. WBTC also contracts with the
Education & Skills Funding Agency for funding such as Study Programmes. In addition to this, the Charity has been
operating other contracts that offer training related revenue. The combination of all of these contracts has enabled
the Charity to provide a diverse range of opportunities in leaming and work to people of all ages.

Public benefit reporting

In planning activities for the year, WBTC has kept in mind the Charity Commission's guidance on Public Benefit. The
focus of our activity remains the advancement of individuals and employers in order to improve vocational skills,
knowledge and behaviours, which in turn will contribute to both the local and national economy. The activities listed
below have directly helped young people into jobs and sustained their employability through promotion, added
responsibility or high leaming opportunities. WBTC's primary focus is within Berkshire and extends to the Thames
Valley region but, where a need is established, beyond this area.

Our Mission

We are dedicated to enriching lives, transforming careers and improving the economic and social wellbeing of our
communities. We empower individuals through bridging skills gaps, developing knowledge and confidence through
high quality tailored study programmes, apprenticeships and commercial! training.

Our main objectives

1. Support young people, especially those disadvantaged and disengaged through study programmes to
help build a brighter future.
Promote apprenticeships with young people and support employers to upskill their current work force.
Evolve the organisation to reduce skill gaps of local and national employers.
Promote a supportive and sustainable work environment for our employees in which they are
encouraged to develop their skills and feel valued.
Instilling self-confidence and self-belief in people who have become accustomed to alienation and
disappointment is core to enabling change.

Achievements and performance

Apprenticeship & Commercial Programmes

WBTC’s commitment to our leamer and employer partners through high quality apprenticeship programmes can be
evidenced through achievement rates that are again significantly above the national! average. In 23/24, 73.24%
achieved their apprenticeship against a national average of 54.3%. Trustee's and the senior management team
maintain its strategic objective of achievement rates to be 10% above the national average. Apprenticeship.
Apprenticeship numbers grew in 23/24 with an increased proportion being delivered directly by WBTC leading to an
improved financial outturn.

Study Programmes

The Study Programme performed under allocation in 23/24. WBTC saw an increased number of leamers remaining
with their school in to year 12 in the local area. Business planning has been implemented to improve performance in
24/25. A new post, Study Programme / Work Experience Tutor was created improve learner access to work
experience and personal development, which has had positive impact as reported by our learners and their parents.
The Study Programme, whilst small in number, is vitally important to our charitable aim of supporting 16-18 year old
NEETs in the local area and the board are keen for the provision to grow to impact more lives.

WEST BERKSHIRE TRAINING CONSORTIUM

STATEMENT OF TRUSTEES’ RESPONSIBILITIES
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2024

The Trustees, who are also the directors of West Berkshire Training Consortium for the purpose of company law,
are responsible for preparing the Trustees' Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law
and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

Company Law requires the Trustees to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and
fair view of the state of affairs of the Charity and of the incoming resources and application of resources, including
the income and expenditure, of the charitable company for that year.

In preparing these financial statements, the Trustees are required to:

- select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;

- observe the methods and principles in the Charities SORP;

- make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;

- state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures
disclosed and explained in the financiat statements; and

- prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Charity
will continue in operation.

The Trustees are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at
any time the financial position of the Charity and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with
the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Charity and hence for taking
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.


WEST BERKSHIRE TRAINING CONSORTIUM

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT
TO THE TRUSTEES OF WEST BERKSHIRE TRAINING CONSORTIUM

Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of West Berkshire Training Consortium (the ‘Charity’) for the year ended
31 July 2024 which comprise the statement of financial activities, the balance sheet, the statement of cash flows
and the notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. The financial
reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting
Standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 102 The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and
Republic of Ireland (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

In our opinion, the financial statements:

: give a true and fair view of the state of the charitable company's affairs as at 31 July 2024 and of its incoming
resources and application of resources, for the year then ended;

- have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice;
and

- have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable
taw. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of
the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Charity in accordance with the ethical
requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical
Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe
that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Conclusions relating to going concern
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the Trustees’ use of the going concern basis of
accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or
conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Charity’s ability to continue as a going
concem for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the Trustees with respect to going concern are described in the
relevant sections of this report.

Other information

The Trustees are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in
the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. Our opinion on the financial
statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in
doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our
knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material
inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material
misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work
we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to
report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.


WEST BERKSHIRE TRAINING CONSORTIUM

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT (CONTINUED)
TO THE TRUSTEES OF WEST BERKSHIRE TRAINING CONSORTIUM

Matters on which we are required to report by exception

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Charities (Accounts and

Reports) Regulations 2008 require us to report to you if, in our opinion:

- the information given in the financial statements is inconsistent in any material respect with the Trustees’
report; or

- sufficient accounting records have not been kept; or

- the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records; or

- we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

Responsibilities of Trustees

As explained more fully in the statement of Trustees' responsibilities, the Trustees, who are also the directors of the
Charity for the purpose of company law, are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being
satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the Trustees determine is necessary to
enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or
error.

In preparing the financial statements, the Trustees are responsible for assessing the Charity’s ability to continue as
a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to gaing concern and using the going concern basis of
accounting unless the Trustees either intend to liquidate the charitable company or to cease operations, or have no
realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
We have been appointed as auditor under section 144 of the Charities Act 2011 and report in accordance with the
Act and relevant regulations made or having effect thereunder.

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance
with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or
error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in
line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including
fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below.


WEST BERKSHIRE TRAINING CONSORTIUM

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT (CONTINUED)
TO THE TRUSTEES OF WEST BERKSHIRE TRAINING CONSORTIUM

Extent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud
Our approach to identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including
fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations, was as follows:

« the engagement partner ensured that the engagement team collectively had the appropriate competence,
capabilities and skills to identify or recognise non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations;

« we identified the laws and regulations applicable to the charitable company through discussions with
trustees and other management, and from our knowledge and experience of the sector;

« we focused on specific laws and regulations which we considered may have a direct material effect on the
financial statements or the operations of the charitable company, including safeguarding, Ofsted, ESFA
tegulatory requirements, the Companies Act 2006, the Charities Act 2011, the Charities SORP, taxation
legislation, data protection, anti-bribery, employment, environmental and health and safety legislation;

* we assessed the extent of compliance with the laws and regulations identified above through making
enquiries of management and inspecting legal correspondence; and

+ identified laws and regulations were communicated within the audit team regularly and the team remained
alert to instances of non-compliance throughout the audit.

We assessed the susceptibility of the charitable company’s financial statements to material misstatement, including
obtaining an understanding of how fraud might occur, by:
« making enquiries of management as to where they considered there was susceptibility to fraud, their
knowledge of actual, suspected and alleged fraud; and
« considering the internal controls in place to mitigate risks of fraud and non-compliance with laws and
regulations.

Audit response to risks identified
To address the risk of fraud through management bias and override of controls, we:
« performed analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships;
«. reviewed all transactions listed;
« assessed whether judgements and assumptions made in determining the accounting estimates were
indicative of potential bias; and
« investigated the rationale behind significant or unusual transactions.

In response to the risk of irregularities and non-compliance with laws and regulations, we designed procedures
which included, but were not limited to:

* agreeing financial statement disclosures to underlying supporting documentation; and

« enquiring of management as to actual and potential litigation and claims.

There are inherent limitations in our audit procedures described above. The more removed that laws and
regulations are from financial transactions, the less likely it is that we would become aware of non-compliance.
Auditing standards also limit the audit procedures required to identify non-compliance with laws and regulations to
enquiry of the Trustees and other management and the inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence, if any.

Material misstatements that arise due to fraud can be harder to detect than those that arise from error as they may
involve deliberate concealment or collusion.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial
Reporting Council's website at: http:/Avww.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our
auditor's report.

Use of our report

This report is made solely to the charity's trustees, as a body, in accordance with part 4 of the Charities (Accounts
and Reports) Regulations 2008. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the charity's trustees
those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the charity and the charity's
trustees as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Accounting policies

Charity information
West Berkshire Training Consortium is a private company limited by guarantee incorporated in England and
Wales. The registered office is Consortium House, 7 Cheap Street, Newbury, Berkshire, RG14 5DD.

Accounting convention

The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Charity's [governing document], the
Companies Act 2006, FRS 102 “The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of
Ireland” (“FRS 102") and the Charities SORP “Accounting and Reporting by Charities: Statement of
Recommended Practice applicable to charities preparing their accounts in accordance with the Financial
Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland (FRS 102)" (effective 1 January 2019). The
Charity is a Public Benefit Entity as defined by FRS 102.

The financial statements are prepared in sterling, which is the functional currency of the Charity. Monetary
amounts in these financial statements are rounded to the nearest £.

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention. The principal accounting
policies adopted are set out below.

Going concern

Following robust contro! of costs in 2023/2024, the Charity’s finances have stabilised and achieved an
operating surplus in the year. At the time of approving the financial statements, the Trustees have a
reasonable expectation that the Charity has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the
foreseeable future. Thus the Trustees continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing
the financial statements.

Charitable funds
Unrestricted funds are available for use at the discretion of the Trustees in furtherance of their charitable
objectives.

Restricted funds are subject to specific conditions by donors or grantors as to how they may be used. The
purposes and uses of the restricted funds are set out in the notes to the financial statements.

Income
Income is recognised when the Charity is legally entitled to it after any performance conditions have been
met, the amounts can be measured reliably, and it is probable that income will be received.

Cash donations are recognised on receipt. Other donations are recognised once the Charity has been notified
of the donation, unless performance conditions require deferral of the amount. Income tax recoverable in

* relation to donations received under Gift Aid or deeds of covenant is recognised at the time of the donation.

Legacies are recognised on receipt or otherwise if the Charity has been notified of an impending distribution,
the amount is known, and receipt is expected. !f the amount is not known, the legacy is treated as a
contingent asset.

Government grants are recognised at the fair value of the asset received or receivable when there is
reasonable assurance that the grant conditions will be met and the grants will be received.

Accounting policies (Continued)

Expenditure

Expenditure is recognised once there is a legal or constructive obligation to transfer economic benefit to a
third party, it is probable that a transfer of economic benefits will be required in settlement and the amount of
the obligation can be measured reliably. Expenditure is classified by activity. The costs of each activity are
made up of the total direct costs and shared costs, including support costs involved in undertaking each
activity. Direct costs attributable to a single activity are allocated directly to that activity. Shared costs which
contribute to more than one activity and support costs which are not attributable to a single activity are
apportioned between those activities on a basis consistent with the use of resources. Central staff costs are
allocated on the basis of time spent, and depreciation charges allocated on the portion of the asset's use.

Expenditure on raising funds includes all expenditure incurred by the Charity to raise funds for its charitable
purposes and includes costs of all fundraising activities events and non-charitable funding.

Expenditure on charitable activities is incurred on directly undertaking the activities which further the Charity's
objectives, as well as any associated support costs.

All expenditure is inclusive of irrecoverable VAT.

Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost or valuation, net of
depreciation and any impairment losses.

Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over their
useful lives on the following bases: .

Fixtures and fittings 25% - 33% straight line

The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the sale
proceeds and the carrying value of the asset, and is recognised in the statement of financial activities.

Impairment of fixed assets

At each reporting end date, the Charity reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible assets to determine
whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication
exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment
loss (if any).

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term liquid
investments with original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown
within borrowings in current liabilities.

Financial instruments
The Charity has elected to apply the provisions of Section 11 ‘Basic Financial Instruments’ and Section 12
‘Other Financial Instruments Issues’ of FRS 102 to all of its financial instruments.

Financial instruments are recognised in the Charity’s balance sheet when the Charity becomes party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument.

Financial assets and liabilities are offset, with the net amounts presented in the financial statements, when
there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a
net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Accounting policies (Continued)

Basic financial assets :

Basic financial assets, which include debtors and cash and bank balances, are initially measured at
transaction price including transaction costs and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the
effective interest method unless the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where the transaction is
measured at the present value of the future receipts discounted at a market rate of interest. Financial assets
classified as receivable within one year are not amortised.

Basic financial liabilities

Basic financial liabilities, including creditors and bank loans are initially recognised at transaction price unless
the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where the debt instrument is measured at the present
value of the future payments discounted at a market rate of interest. Financial liabilities classified as payable
within one year are not amortised.

Debt instruments are subsequently carried at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.

Trade creditors are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of
operations from suppliers. Amounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one
year or less. If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities. Trade creditors are recognised initially at
transaction price and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

Derecognition of financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the Charity's contractual obligations expire or are discharged or
cancelled.

Employee benefits
The cost of any unused holiday entitlement is recognised in the period in which the employee's services are
received.

Termination benefits are recognised immediately as an expense when the Charity is demonstrably committed
to terminate the employment of an employee or to provide termination benefits.

Retirement benefits
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements

In the application of the Charity's accounting policies, the Trustees are required to make judgements,
estimates and assumptions about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other
factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting
estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised where the revision affects only that
period, or in the period of the revision and future periods where the revision affects both current and future
periods.
