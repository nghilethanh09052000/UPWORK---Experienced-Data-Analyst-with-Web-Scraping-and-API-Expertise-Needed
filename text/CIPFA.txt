CIPFA Business Board

CIPFA Business Limited (“CBL”) is the professional services business of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance
and Accountancy (“CIPFA’). As part of the CIPFA Group, CBL governance arrangements are integrated with
CIPFA. The CIPFA Commercial Board that meets at least five times a year, also acts as the CBL Board and is
responsible for taking decisions and monitoring the business and performance. The majority of the Directors are
independent non-executives.

The Directors of CBL are all experienced in professional services, the delivery of public services or broader
business leadership

Strategic Report

Principal Activities

CBL is the professional services business of the CIPFA. During 2023, the emphasis of our support to clients has
continued to be focussed on assisting them with improving financial management, governance and performance.
The Government continues to require all public bodies to modernise their practices and deliver further efficiencies
as part of reducing spend across public services. Thus, 2023 has seen a repeated demand for services designed
to support public bodies to deliver efficiency gains and improve their performance. Our customers seek support to
improve their performance and manage change, including advice on financial management, sharing services and
partnership working. Our services in response to this demand include:

e Information Services that provide a range of publications, including TISonline; a broad range of statistical
surveys, data collection and benchmarking services; and market research to Central and Local
Government as well as the NHS.

e Property Services that provide support to property and asset managers via our property related networks,
advisory services to support change; property condition and access surveys, and property asset
management software as well as wider support on the management of an organisation's assets.

e An Advisory Services team providing a range of support services to facilitate transformational change and
improve efficiency, financial management and value for money advice; underpinned by networks, various
models and toolkits, and training and development programmes.

e Counter Fraud Services that provide training, tools and ideas to shape the future of counter fraud;
working closely with the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG), the National Crime
Agency (NCA), Cabinet Office and other agencies and are dedicated to helping counter fraud practitioners
both here and abroad.

Review of Business

During the year, our customers continued to deal with the consequences of higher inflation and slower economic
growth. The impact of this has been significant — the underlying cost of service provision has increased, and at the
same time, the demand for services has increased as the cost-of-living crisis pushes more people into needing
support.

In that context, the Board considers the performance for 2023 to be strong as turnover increased by 1% to £14.2m
(2022: £14.1m), and CBL delivered a profit of £4.4m (2022: £4.7m). The reduction in profit of £0.3m was due to
increased staff costs resulting from greater use of temporary staff to cover vacancies that were challenging to
recruit.

The performance in 2023, allied with the continued development of our commercial portfolio and keeping the cost
base under review, will enable us to continue to respond effectively to the demand for performance improvement
and transformation support in public services. Although a majority of our sales, by value in 2023, were made to
local authorities, we continue to increase our client base in other sectors and forge strong and new customer
relationships and partnerships in areas like Central Government and Health.

Results and Dividends

The overall profit for the year before taxation was £4,404,000 (2022: £4,688,000) and as in previous years the
directors do not propose to pay a dividend.

Under gift aid arrangements, all profits after taxation are transferred to our shareholder, CIPFA.

CIPFA is a registered charity and uses the funds generated by CBL to promote the science of public finance and to
support its overall objectives.

CIPFA Business Limited . Registered Number: 2376684

Future Outlook
Despite the challenges highlighted above, the prospects for CBL are seen as positive. Public services in the UK
must continue to transform and deliver more for less, which drives demand for our services.

The Board is intent on ensuring that the business responds to the challenging market and is fit for purpose for our
customers. We will continue to provide, develop, and deliver a range of high-quality solutions and services to both
meet the requirements of our client base and the initiatives and developments arising from Government. We will
continue to work closely with our chosen sectors to establish effective partnerships to strengthen our position in the
supply chain to support public services. Finally, the Board will maintain a rigorous approach to managing our cost
base to ensure that improvements in our revenue position flow through to the continued profitability of the
company, alongside investing in our products and services to ensure we remain relevant and competitive for our
customer base.

Risk Management

CIPFA’s Management Board (“CMB”) and the CBL Board continued throughout the year to review the key risks
facing CBL. CMB is responsible for the day-to-day management of CIPFA and its subsidiaries. On a monthly basis,
CMB reviewed the operational and corporate risk registers and the progress against the agreed mitigating actions.
The Corporate Risk Register is reported to and discussed at each Board meeting.

CBL remains alert to both the immediate and longer-term risks it faces. As the economy grapples with the impacts
of inflation and low economic growth, we have again reviewed our activities and delivery mechanisms to ensure we
remain competitive and relevant to our customers. There has also been a consequential impact on staff recruitment
and retention. Our pilot of a four-day working week to enhance staff retention is continuing through December
2024.

Whilst inflation appears to have plateaued, economic growth remains sluggish, and as a result, there is a continued
long-term risk of the Government's tightening of public service expenditure. This has resulted in an increasing
number of Councils issuing ‘Section 114’ notices — the local government equivalent of possible bankruptcy. CBL
may experience additional challenges this year as Councils and Government Departments reduce spending due to
the pending elections.

The CBL Board recognises the financial impact that the Government's policies have had and will continue to have
on our core markets. It considers that with the company’s current services and continued development of our
portfolio allied with its financial resources and cash flows, it is well placed to manage its risks successfully despite
the challenging economic outlook. At the same time, the squeeze on the public sector and the continued
requirement for them to innovate in their delivery of services presents CBL with an opportunity to assist our
customers in delivering those innovations.

CIPFA Business Limited : Registered Number: 2376684

Directors Report
For the year ended 31 December 2023

The Directors of the CIPFA Business Limited (“CBL") present their report and the audited financial statements for
the year ended 31 December 2023. The company registration number is 2376684.

Corporate Governance
The corporate governance of the Company is regularly reviewed to ensure that high standards are maintained.

The company operates within the CIPFA Group arrangements for Audit and Remuneration. The CIPFA Group
operates a separate Group Audit Committee and a Remuneration Committee, which comprises non-executive
Directors and CIPFA Trustees. The CBL Board meets on a regular basis and consists of a mixture of executive and
non-executive Directors.

In addition to a statutory audit, the CIPFA Group also commissions an internal audit service, which includes the
activities of CBL.

Going Concern

The Board has assessed the ability of the company to continue as a going concern and has considered several
factors when forming their conclusion as to whether the use of the going concern basis is appropriate when
preparing these financial statements. This has included the budget for 2024, the scenario planning and sensitivity
applied to preparing the 2024-26 Business Plan, cashflow forecasts to 31 December 2025 and a consideration of
the key risks.

In addition, the Board is aware of the continued pressure on prices during 2024. It is unlikely that CBL will be able
to pass on all of its rising costs to customers, increasing pressure on margins and necessitating even tighter control
of the cost base. The Board believes that its strategy of diversifying products in existing markets and identifying
new markets will manage the inflation risks. The Board also notes that its policy of transferring profits to the CIPFA
Group by way of Gift Aid is unlikely to be compromised significantly by these inflationary pressures.

The Board recognises the dependence of the company on the public sector market and the long-term risk resulting
from the Government's continued tightening of public services expenditure and the potential effect on the income
streams of a number of our services. In 2023, we have continued to implement our strategy around a majority of
digitised content and delivery so that, as a business, we are able to offer more of our products and services with
less reliance on face-to-face delivery. In turn, this has widened our potential market and audience and proved
popular with our customers, making us more resilient to future events and risks. In addition, budgeted investment
decisions will only be made when the Board is satisfied that the underlying trading performance supports that
investment. CBL has flexibility within its budgets and forecasts due to the levels of discretionary spending
incorporated. The latest reforecast covering the period to December 2025 has considered a reasonable worst case
scenario, which incorporates a fall in revenue and shows that CBL are able to meet its working capital
requirements across the period. . CBL does not hold significant reserves as its profits are paid across to its
ultimate parent, CIPFA, on an annual basis. The Board is satisfied that the forecasts and modelling undertaken
over the period of review indicate that CBL has sufficient working capital to meet its commitments when they fall
due.

Having regard to the above, the Directors believe there are no material uncertainties surrounding the decision to
adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.

Directors

The Directors that held office during the year are listed on page 2. No Directors held any shares in the Company
during the period (2022: Nil). All non-executive Directors of the Company are nominated for appointment by the
CIPFA Council.

Directors’ and Officers’ Liability Insurance
During the year the Company purchased insurance to indemnify Directors and Officers against personal losses
associated with their role with the company as permitted by Section 233 of the Companies Act 2006.

CIPFA Business Limited : Registered Number: 2376684

Directors’ Responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and financial statements in accordance with
applicable law and regulations.

Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the
Directors have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with FRS102, The Financial Reporting
Standard applicable to the UK and the Republic of Ireland (United Kingdom Standards and applicable taw).

Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of the profit-or loss of the company for that period. In
preparing those financial statements, the Directors are required to:

e select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;

e make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;

e state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures
disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and

e prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the
company will continue in business.

The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the
company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company
and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

So far as each of the Directors at the date of this report is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the
company’s auditor is unaware. Each director has taken all steps that he/she ought to have taken as a director in
order to make himself/herself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the company’s auditor is
aware of that information.

Auditor
Crowe U.K. LLP has indicated its willingness to be reappointed as statutory auditor, and a resolution to re-appoint
them as auditor to the company will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.

CIPFA Business Limited Registered Number: 2376684

Independent Auditor’s Report to the Members of CIPFA Business Limited
Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of CIPFA Business Limited (‘the company’) for the year ended 31
December 2023 which comprise the Statement of Comprehensive Income, the balance sheet, the Statement
of cash flows and notes to the financial statements, including significant accounting policies. The financial
reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom
Accounting Standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 102 The Financial Reporting Standard
applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

In our opinion the financial statements:

give a true and fair view of the state of the company’s affairs as at 31 December 2023 and of its profit for the
year then ended;

have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice,
and

have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and
applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's
responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the
company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial
statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Conclusions relating to going concern
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the director's use of the going concern basis of
accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or
conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the company’s ability to continue as
a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for
issue.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the Directors with respect to going concern are described in
the relevant sections of this report.

Other information

The Directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report. The other
information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and
our auditor's report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information
and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance
conclusion thereon.

Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is
materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise
appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material
misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the
financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a
material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.

CIPFA Business Limited . Registered Number: 2376684

Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion based on the work undertaken in the course of our audit

the information given in the director's report, which includes the Directors’ report and the strategic report
prepared for the purposes of company law, for the financial year for which the financial statements are
prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and

the strategic report and the Directors’ report included within the Directors’ report have been prepared in
accordance with applicable legal requirements.

Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the course of
the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the Directors’ report.

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006
requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:

adequate and proper accounting records have not been kept; or.

the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
certain disclosures of Directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or

we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

Responsibilities of Directors

As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement, the Directors are responsible for the
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such
internal control as the trustees determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the company’s ability to
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going
concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the company or to cease
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes
our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit
conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate,
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these
financial statements.

Details of the extent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud and
non-compliance with laws and regulations are set out below.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial

Reporting Council's website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of
our auditor's report.

1

CIPFA Business Limited . Registered Number: 2376684

Extent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud
Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We identified and
assessed the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements from irregularities, whether due to
fraud or error, and discussed these between our audit team members. We then designed and performed
audit procedures responsive to those risks, including obtaining audit evidence sufficient and appropriate to
provide a basis for our opinion.

We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks within which the company operates,
focusing on those laws and regulations that have a direct effect on the determination of material amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements. The laws and regulations we considered in this context were the
Companies Act 2006. We assessed the required compliance with these laws and regulations as part of our
audit procedures on the related financial statement items.

In addition, we considered provisions of other laws and regulations that do not have a direct effect on the
financial statements but compliance with which might be fundamental to the company’s ability to operate or
to avoid a material penalty. We also considered the opportunities and incentives that may exist within the
company for fraud. The laws and regulations we considered in this context for the UK operations were
taxation legislation, employment legislation and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Auditing standards limit the required audit procedures to identify non-compliance with these laws and
regulations to enquiry of the Trustees and other management and inspection of regulatory and legal
correspondence, if any.

We identified the greatest risk of material impact on the financial statements from irregularities, including
fraud, to be within the timing surrounding recognition of income and the override of controls by management.
Our audit procedures to respond to these risks included enquiries of management, internal audit and the
Audit Committee about their own identification and assessment of the risks of irregularities, sample testing
on the posting of journals, reviewing accounting estimates for biases, reviewing regulatory correspondence
and reading minutes of meetings of those charged with governance.

Owing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk that we may not have detected
some material misstatements in the financial statements, even though we have properly planned and
performed our audit in accordance with auditing standards. For example, the further removed non-
compliance with laws and regulations (irregularities) is from the events and transactions reflected in the
financial statements, the less likely the inherently limited procedures required by auditing standards would
identify it. In addition, as with any audit, there remained a higher risk of non-detection of irregularities, as
these may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal
controls. We are not responsible for preventing non-compliance and cannot be expected to detect non-
compliance with all laws and regulations.

Use of our report

This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16
of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s
members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To
the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the
company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we
have formed.

Company information

CIPFA Business Limited (“CBL”) is a company limited by shares and is registered in the United Kingdom
(company number: 2376684). It is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and
Accountancy (registered charity number: 231060). The results of CIPFA Business Limited are consolidated
in full within the Group financial statements of the Charity. The registered office is 77 Mansell Street, London,
E1 8AN.

Accounting Conventions

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention in accordance with the
Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland (FRS102) — effective 1 January
2019 and the Companies Act 2006.

The functional currency of the company is GBP because that is the currency of the primary economic
environment in which the company operates. The financial statements are also presented in GBP.

Going Concern

The Board has assessed the ability of the company to continue as a going concern and has considered
several factors when forming their conclusion as to whether the use of the going concern basis is appropriate
when preparing these financial statements. This has included the budget for 2023, the scenario planning and
sensitivity applied to preparing the 2024-26 Business Plan, cashflow forecasts to 31 December 2025 and a
consideration of the key risks, including the continued impact of the pandemic and consequences.

In addition, the Board is aware of the impact of the likely continued increase in prices during 2023. It is
unlikely that CBL will be able to pass on all of its rising costs to customers, increasing pressure on margins
and necessitating even tighter control of the cost base. The Board believes that its strategy of diversifying
products in existing markets and identifying new markets will manage the inflation risks. The Board also
notes that its policy of transferring profits to the CIPFA Group by way of Gift Aid is unlikely to be
compromised significantly by these inflationary pressures.

The Board recognises the dependence of the company on the public sector market and the long-term risk
resulting from the Government's continued tightening of public services expenditure and the potential effect
on the income streams of a number of our services. In 2023, we have continued to implement our strategy
around a majority of digitised content and delivery so that, as a business, we are able to offer more of our
products and services with less reliance on face-to-face delivery. In turn, this has widened our potential
market and audience and proved popular with our customers, making us more resilient to future events and
risks. In addition, budgeted investment decisions will only be made when the Board is satisfied that the
underlying trading performance supports that investment. CBL has flexibility within its budgets and forecasts
due to the levels of discretionary spending incorporated. The latest reforecast covering the period to
December 2025 has considered a reasonable worst case scenario, which incorporates a fall in revenue and
shows that CBL are able to meet its working capital requirements across the period. . CBL does not hold
significant reserves as its profits are paid across to its ultimate parent, CIPFA, on an annual basis. The
Board is satisfied that the forecasts and modelling undertaken over the period of review indicate that CBL
has sufficient working capital to meet its commitments when they fall due.

Having regard to the above, the Directors believe there are no material uncertainties surrounding the
decision to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.

Income Recognition

Income is credited to the statement of comprehensive income in the year to which it relates. Income is
deferred only when conditions must be fulfilled before CIPFA Business Limited becomes entitled to it. In the
case of subscriptions for journals and electronic services any receipt in respect of future years is shown as
deferred income.

Accrued Income

Income is accrued in the statement of comprehensive income based upon judgements assessing the level of
completion for revenue that cannot be invoiced as the requested service has not been fully delivered.

Notes to the Financial Statements
For the year ended 31 December 2023

Expenditure recognition
Expenditure is debited to the statement of comprehensive income on an accruals basis:

External Charges comprise direct expenditure on contractor fees and other costs

Staff costs include all pension and other related staff costs

Other operating charges include all other overhead allocations from CIPFA.

Costs for the group support departments are recharged to CBL on different bases dependant on the
nature of those costs. These include headcount, count of financial transactions and an estimation of
time spent.

Pension

CIPFA operates a defined contribution Group Personal Pension Plan via Aegon, introduced from 1 January
2007. The Wiltshire defined benefit scheme was closed on 30 September 2022 and all members moved
across to the defined contribution scheme under Aegon.

Defined contributions are paid to the Group Personal Pension Plan via Aegon in accordance with the group
policy. The policy allows for minimum employee contributions of 3%, with the employer contributing double
the employee contribution up to a maximum of 10%.

Leased assets — lessee

Rentals under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, even if the
payments are not made on such a basis. Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to sign an
operating lease are similarly spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Intangible fixed assets — representing research and development expenditure

Intangible fixed assets represent development costs capitalised in accordance with FRS102. These are
stated at historical cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over the period which revenue is expected to
be generated (three to five years).

Amortisation is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income

Tangible fixed assets and depreciation

Fixed assets are capitalised and depreciated if the value is greater than £1,000 for an individual asset or
greater than £5,000 for a capital project.

Tangible fixed assets are depreciated from the month the asset is first used on a straight-line basis over the
estimated economic lives as follows:

Years
Computer equipment : 3
Fixtures, fittings & other equipment 3-5

Assets under construction relate to information technology development and are not depreciated until
brought into use.

The assets’ residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted prospectively
if appropriate, or if there is an indication of a significant change since the last reporting date.

Deferred Taxation

Deferred tax is provided in full in respect of taxation deferred by material timing differences between the
treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes. A deferred tax asset is only recognised
where the conditions for recognition in FRS 102 are satisfied and such balances may fall due after more than
one year.

Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the
financial statements are described in the accounting policies and are summarised below:

Accrued income — The charity estimates accrued income based upon judgements assessing the level of
completion for revenue that cannot be invoiced as the requested service has not been fully delivered.
Accrued income is disclosed in note 9

Debtor Provisions — The company maintains a provision for all debts over six months, The provisions are
disclosed in note 9.

Financial Instruments

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the company becomes a party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument. Additionally, all financial assets and liabilities are classified
according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. Financial assets and liabilities are
initially measured at transaction price (including transaction costs) and are subsequently re-measured where
applicable at amortised cost. Assets and liabilities held in foreign currency are translated to GBP at the
balance sheet date at an appropriate year end exchange rate.

gift aid.
