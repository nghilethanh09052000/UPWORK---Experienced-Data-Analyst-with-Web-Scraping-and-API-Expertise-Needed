Notes to the Financial Statements
1.
General Information
Lite (Stockport) Limited
is a private company, limited by shares, incorporated in England & Wales, registered number
04708813
. The registered office is Soloman House, Belgrave Court, Fulwood, Preston, PR2 9PL.
2.
Accounting Policies
2.1.
Basis of Preparation of Financial Statements
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102 section 1A Small Entities "The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland" and the Companies Act 2006.
2.2.
Turnover
Turnover comprises the invoiced value of goods and services supplied by the company, net of Value Added Tax and trade discounts.
2.3.
Tangible Fixed Assets and Depreciation
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less depreciation. Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost of the fixed assets, less their estimated residual value, over their expected useful lives on the following bases:
Freehold
No depreciation
Plant & Machinery
25% reducing balance
Motor Vehicles
25% reducing balance
Fixtures & Fittings
25% reducing balance
2.4.
Taxation
Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the statement of comprehensive income because of items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other year and items that are never taxable or deductible. The company's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.
Deferred tax is recognised on timing differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable timing differences. Deferred tax assets are generally recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible timing differences can be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. Deferred tax liabilities are presented within provisions for liabilities and deferred tax assets within debtors. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and asset reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Company expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.
Current or deferred tax for the year is recognised in profit or loss, except when they related to items that are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.
