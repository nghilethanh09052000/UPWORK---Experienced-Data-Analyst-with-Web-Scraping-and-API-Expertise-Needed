TRUSTEES' REPORT

Public Benefit

We have referred to the guidance contained in the Charity Commission’s general guidance on public benefit when
reviewing our aims and objectives and in planning our future activities. In particular the trustees consider how planned
activities will contribute to the aims and objectives they have set.

Our Strategic Objectives
1, Promote lifelong learning and development with leamers, staff and employers.

2. Develop and deliver products and services offering progression through education, training, development and
assessment, unlocking potential and delivering improved customer business performance.

3. Continually improve quality of content and delivery, focussing on stretching both the capability and experience for
the learner.

4. Work in partnership with customers and stakeholders to provide solutions to their requirements at a local, regional
and national level.

5. Utilise the charity’s resources responsibly in pursuit of the strategic objectives.

CHALLENGES, ACHIEVEMENTS AND PERFORMANCE

The full year results for fiscal year 23/24 have returned a very healthy surplus, well above the planned budgetary figure.
Income overall was on budget and some 10% up on prior year. Commercial course activity remains strong, and the results
reflect this at 17% above budget and prior year. The commercial course calendar is very well populated, and in line with
ever-increasing demand, investment is planned for the early part of fiscal year 24/25 to develop a new commercial suite
of classrooms and practical training area. This in tum will allow for additional changes in the practical and classroom
environment for apprenticeships to further increase our capacity and user experience. Expenditure was below the planned
budget due in the main to the challenging environment for recruiting additional delivery staff and the reluctance of
apprentices to undertake End Point Assessment (EPA).

Recruitment numbers for the September 2023 intake were 152 which represented a 100% capacity utilisation and was
above the budgeted number. Within the apprentice starts for the past year was the first cohort of FDME apprentices to
undertake the programme at the Coventry facility. Apprentice numbers for the 2024 intake look very positive with new
companies committing to apprenticeship training with MGTS for the first time. The recruitment team continue to engage
with careers events throughout catchment areas for both Coventry and Redditch centres, supporting the drive to increase
applicant interest and numbers.

MGTS continues to achieve high levels of learner success rates and maintain a position of at least 12% above the national
achievement rate. This is underpinned by the levels of work and progress continuing at pace on executing the MGTS
Quality Framework Strategy, particularly around curriculum development and teaching and learning. The appointment of
a Curriculum Manager has further strengthened the Senior Leadership Team and supports the focus on the drive to higher
standards of teaching and learning curriculum development. Monthly Quality Improvement Meetings take place and link
directly to the QIP (Quality Improvement Plan) and SAR (Self-Assessment Report).

MGTS took the decision within the last year to better utilise its short-term deposits and worked with an investment
company on a charity specific investment package. Areas such as ethical objections on investments, along with liability
forecasting and liquidity were all considered to develop the most suitable investment portfolio to support the charity and
its aims.

Apprentices once again participated in outdoor challenge programmes with over 100 undertaking the experience which
supports the behaviours element of their apprenticeship in activities that are different to the normal working environment.

TRUSTEES' REPORT
31 March 2024

Financial review
The financial year resulted in an unrestricted surplus of £469,877, an increase from £218,452 in 2023.

Income

Total unrestricted income of £4.8m was generated in 2023-2024, an increase of 8.5% over the previous year.
Apprentice training income represented 75% of income, with commercial activities, reserve movements and investment
income making up the balance. Commercial course demand continues to be buoyant and revenue from this business
area continues to grow. Investment retums are showing significant growth year-over-year, driven in part by the
continued high interest rate environment. Recognising the limitations of traditional interest-bearing accounts, the
Board of Trustees made a strategic decision to invest £1.5m in a diversified portfolio of investment assets. This offers
potential for a superior rate of return compared to lower-yielding savings options.

Expenditure
Unrestricted expenditure in 2023-2024 was £4.3m, £1m of this is related to our commercial activities, and the
remaining £3.3m was spent supporting our charitable aims.

Funds
Total funds on 31 March 2024 were £4.1m (2023 £2.2m) of which all but £264,709 were unrestricted.

Principal Risks and Uncertainties

Ofsted - the introduction of the Education Inspection Framework in September 2019 means a renewed focus on quality
and compliance e.g. Inspectors will be spending less time looking at performance data, and more time considering how
providers are making sure their learners are developing the knowledge, skills and behaviours required to allow them
to successfully progress and achieve. MGTS has now been inspected in the form of a full inspection. Having been 7
years since the last short inspection and 13 years since the last full inspection, this was undoubtedly a significant review
of MGTS and its apprenticeship provision. The results as shown below bear testament to the continued success of the
business and the hard work to continually strive for excellence across all facets of the business.

Overall effectiveness Good

The quality of education Good
Behaviour and attitudes Good
Personal development Good
Leadership and management Good
Apprenticeships Good

Inspectors took account of the MGTS’s most recent self-assessment report and development plans, and the previous
inspection report. The inspection was carried out using the further education and skills inspection handbook and took into
account all relevant provision at MGTS. Inspectors collected a wide range of evidence to inform judgements, including
visiting learning sessions, scrutinising learners’ work, seeking the views of learners, staff and other stakeholders, and
examining MGTS’s documentation and records.

Inflation - the UK’s rate of inflation has continued to impact on the business over the last 12 months, driven by such
factors as food pricing, wholesale gas prices and worker shortages and wage increase demands. Increasing levels of
pricing in raw materials has a major impact on MGTS which specializes in engineering biased training and
development, particularly when one factors in the stagnation of apprenticeship funding levels.

MIDLAND GROUP TRAINING SERVICES LIMITED
TRUSTEES' REPORT

31 March 2024

Staff recruitment — recruitment in general across all sectors remains challenging, none more so than those related to
engineering and further education. Open job advertisements can take a considerable time to fill, particularly with what
appears to be a weakened talent pool. Undoubtedly high performers are being retained by their existing business.
Despite these challenges MGTS is moving forward and continues to strengthen the team for both practical and theory
based educational training. :

Government influence - ever present are the risks and uncertainties from modifications to structure and funding of the
apprenticeship education and training sector made by Government.

Policies

a) Reserves
The Board of Trustees have assessed the free reserves (unrestricted funds excluding fixed assets, designated funds,
and restricted funds) needed to maintain operations if some income-generating activities are temporarily curtailed.
This ensures continued support for our charitable mission even amidst potential financial fluctuations.

The Trustees consider that an appropriate level of free reserves on 31 March 2024 would be 6 months of the group's
budgeted expenditure amounting to £2.15 million. The actual free reserves on that date stood at £1.6 million, a
shortfall of £0.55 million compared to the target. This is effectively addressed by the long-term investment
portfolio valued at £0.9 million on 31S March 2024. This demonstrates our commitment to prudent financial
management and ensures the availability of resources, even during periods of temporary income reduction.

b) Investments
Under the Memorandum and Articles of Association, the charity has the power to invest in any way the trustees
wish. The Trustees have determined that the Charities short term investments should be in the form of interest-
bearing cash deposits with major banks or financial institutions. Interest rates should be competitive and free of
risk to the capital. Longer term investments have been placed with investment managers in two separate portfolios
as follows:

Portfolio 1 - is managed in line with The Evelyn Partners Strategy 4 approach to investment risk and is
described as being appropriate for an investor who is comfortable with medium volatility of returns,
typically having around 55% of their portfolio invested in equities, and who is able to tolerate a loss of up to
15% of the value of their portfolio in any one year. This percentage loss is based on what might be
reasonably expected 95% of the time. The projected annualised rate of return over the longer term is the
Consumer Price Index (CPI) +2%

Portfolio 2 is a bespoke portfolio designed to match MGTS anticipated liabilities moving forward. As such,
the account is invested in a mix of short dated UK Government bonds (1 month to 2 years, with the majority
of the capital invested at the shorter end) allowing growth of the principal whilst permitting realisation of
the funds at defined time intervals (if required).

STRUCTURE, GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT

The Charity is a company, limited by guarantee, and has no share capital. It was incorporated on 17 July 1970. Its
governing document is its Memorandum and Articles of Association, which were updated on 6" March 2019. The liability
of each member in the event of winding up is limited to £20.

MIDLAND GROUP TRAINING SERVICES LIMITED

TRUSTEES' REPORT
31 March 2024

Risk management

We confirm that major risks have been reviewed and that systems and procedures have been established to manage those
risks,

Government and Agencies

The Government will fully fund apprenticeships in small businesses from 1st April 2024 by paying the full cost of
training for anyone up to the age of 21 - reducing.costs and burdens for businesses and delivering more opportunities for
young people to kick start their careers. This will remove the need for small employers to meet some of the cost of
training and saves time and costs for providers like further education colleges who currently need to source funding
separately from the government and businesses.

The move is underpinned by an additional £60 million of new government funding for next year, guaranteeing that
where there is demand for apprenticeships from businesses, the government will ensure there is enough funding to
deliver them. From the start of April, the government will also increase the amount of funding that employers who are
paying the apprenticeship levy can pass onto other businesses. Apprenticeships can currently be funded by a levy paying
employer transferring up to 25% of their unused levy to a different employer.

IfATE are undertaking a set of exceptional funding band reviews for 20 high-volume apprenticeships in skills shortage
occupations and priority sectors. The 20 apprenticeships, which are all at level 2 or 3, were chosen by the DfE,
following consultation with provider representative bodies, and taking account of available evidence on the impact of
cost inflation on apprenticeships delivery. The reviews are intended to help employers and apprenticeship providers
tackle rising costs in priority sectors with skills shortages, including engineering.

ESFA funding rules version 2, of the apprenticeship funding rules, brought key changes, including recognising that 16-
18-year-olds starting apprenticeships are unlikely to hold relevant prior learning. Providers must check an individual’s
prior learning record and discuss their work history for relevant prior learning. Where there is no relevant prior leaning
and work experience, providers should document this with the employer and no further action is needed. If there is
relevant prior learning and work experience, providers can complete the normal skills scan process to determine whether
there should be a reduction in price, content and duration.

DIRECTORS' RESPONSIBILITIES IN THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
: 31 March 2024

The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable
law and United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice. Company law requires the directors to prepare
financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the charitable
company and of the incoming resources and application of resources, including the income and expenditure, of the
"charitable company for that period. ; , ,

In preparing those financial statements, the directors are required to:

a.

b.

d.

select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;

prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the
charitable company will continue in business;

The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any
time the financial position of the charitable company and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the

MIDLAND GROUP TRAINING SERVICES LIMITED

AUDITOR’S REPORT
Independent auditor’s report to the members of Midland Group Training Services Limited

Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of Midland Group Training Services Ltd (the ‘parent company’) and its
subsidiaries (the ‘group’) for the year ended 31 March 2024 which comprise the Consolidated Statement of Financial
Activities, the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the parent company Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement
and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. The financial reporting
framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

In our opinion the financial statements:

- give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and parent company’s affairs as at 31 March 2023 and of
its incoming resources and application of resources, including its income and expenditure, for the year then
ended;

- have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice;
and

- have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with Intemational Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law.
Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors responsibilities for the audit of the
financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the group in accordance with the ethical requirements
that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard, and we have
fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence
we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Conclusions relating to going concern

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to report

to you where:

- the trustees’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is not
appropriate; or

- the trustees have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast
significant doubt about the charitable company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concem basis of
accounting for a period of at least twelve months from the date when the financial statements are authorised
for issue.

Other information
The trustées are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in thé
annual report, other than the financial statements arid our Report of the Independent Auditors thereon.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of
assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing
so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge
obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we
conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have
nothing to report in this regard.

Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
- the information given in the Report of the Trustees for the financial year for which the financial
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
- the Report of the Trustees has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

MIDLAND GROUP TRAINING SERVICES LIMITED
AUDITOR’S REPORT

Independent auditor’s report to the members of Midland Group Training Services Limited

Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the charitable company and its environment obtained in the course
of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the Report of the Trustees.

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to
you if, in our opinion:
- ‘adequate accounting records have not been kept or retums adequate for our audit have not been
received from branches not visited by us; or
- the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
- - certain disclosures of trustees' remuneration specified by law are not made; or
- we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
- the trustees were not entitled to take advantage of the small companies exemption from the
requirement to prepare a Strategic Report or in preparing the Report of the Trustees.

Responsibilities of trustees

As explained more fully in the Statement of Trustees Responsibilities, the trustees (who are also the directors of the
parent company for the purposes of company law) are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and
for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the trustees determine is
necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to
fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the trustees are responsible for assessing the group and the parent company's
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going
concern basis of accounting unless the trustees either intend to liquidate the charitable company or to cease
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue a Report of the Independent Auditors that includes
our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from
fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in
line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including
fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting these irregularities, including fraud is detailed
below: , , .
In identifying and assessing the risk of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including fraud and non-
compliance with laws and regulations, our procedures included the following:
- reference to past history and experience of the Entity,
- enquiry of management, including obtaining and reviewing supporting documentation conceming the
Entity's procedures relating to:
-identifying and complying with laws and regulations and whether they were aware of any instances of non-
compliance;
-detection and response to risk of fraud and whether they were aware of any actual or suspected instances of
fraud.
- assessment of the controls and processes that the Entity has in place to mitigate risk.

Our assessments included the identification of the following potential areas for fraud:

- Management override of control; and

- Revenue recognition - specifically the recognition according to timing of the provision of training services,
and manipulation of revenue through management override of journals.

MIDLAND GROUP TRAINING SERVICES LIMITED

AUDITOR’S REPORT
Independent auditor’s report to the members of Midland Group Training Services Limited

We design audit procedures by tailored and directed testing to aid and support the level of determined level of risk. In

response to the assessed risk we plan audit tests and procedures that target specific areas where misstatement may

occur. These procedures and the extent to which they are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, are

detailed below:

- We critically assessed the appropriateness and tested the application of the revenue and cost recognition
policies. , , , .

- We tested the appropriateness of accounting journals and other adjustments made in the preparation of the
financial statements.

- We reviewed the Entity's accounting policies for non-compliance with relevant standards.

- We made enquiries of management and reviewed correspondence with the relevant authorities to identify
any irregularities or instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations.

In performing an audit in accordance with UK GAAP, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional

scepticism throughout the audit process.

We also communicated relevant identified laws and regulations and potential fraud risks to all engagement team

members and remained alert to any indications of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations throughout the

audit.

The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as

fraud may involve collusion or override of internal controls. There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures

performed.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial

Reporting Council's website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our Report of

the Independent Auditors.

Use of our report

This report is made solely to the charitable company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16

of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the charitable company's

members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors' report and for no other purpose. To the fullest
extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the charitable company and

the charitable company's members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES
31 March 2024

1 Accounting Policies

Basis of preparation :

The financial statements of the charitable company, which is a public benefit entity under FRS102, have been prepared in
accordance with the Charities SORP (FRS102) ‘Accounting and Reporting by Charities: Statement of Recommended
Practice applicable to charities preparing their accounts in accordance with the Financial Reporting Standard in the UK
and Republic of Ireland (FRS102)( effective 1 January 2019)’, Financial Reporting Standard 102 ‘The Financial Reporting
Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland’ and the Companies Act 2006. The financial statements have been
prepared under the historical cost convention with the exception of investments which are included at market value.

Accounting changes
The significant accounting policies adopted are described below.

Significant judgements and estimates

The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make significant judgements and estimates that affect
the amounts reported within the balance sheet and statement of financial activities. The following are the Company’s
key sources of estimation uncertainty:

e Multi- employer defined benefit pension scheme liability

The schedule of contributions for the multi-employer defined benefit pension scheme is determined using actuarial
valuations. The actuarial valuation involves making assumptions about discount rates, future salary increases, mortality
rates and future pension increases. Due to the complexity of the valuation, the underlying assumptions and the long-term
nature of these plans, such estimates are subject to significant uncertainty. The mortality rate is based on publicly available
mortality tables for the specific country. Future salary and pension increases are based on expected future inflation rates
for the respective country.

The Company has included a liability within the financial statements to reflect its own future funding obligations based
upon a discounted cash flow basis. The discount rate used is 0.85%.

In determining the appropriate discount rate, management considers the interest rate of AA corporate bonds denominated
in Great British pound sterling, with a bond maturity similar in duration to the defined benefit funding obligation.

Group financial statements
The statement of financial activities (SOFA) and group balance sheet consolidate the financial statements of the charity
and its subsidiary undertaking. The results of the subsidiary are consolidated on a line by line basis.

A separate SOFA and income and expenditure account are not presented for the charity itself following the exemptions
afforded by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.

Income recognition policy

Income is recognised when the charity has entitlement to the funds, any performance conditions attached to the item(s) of
income have been met, it is probable that the income will be received and the amount can be measured reliably.

Income from government and other grants, whether ‘capital’ grants or ‘revenue’ grants, is recognised when the charity
has entitlement to the funds, any performance conditions attached to the grants have been met, it is probable that the
income will be received, and the amount can be measured reliably and is not deferred.

Investment income is recognised on a receivable basis.

MIDLAND GROUP TRAINING SERVICES LIMITED

ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
31 March 2024

Resources expended and irrecoverable VAT
Expenditure is recognised when a liability is incurred. Contractual arrangements and performance related grants are
recognised as goods and services are supplied.

Charitable activities include expenditure associated in the provision of training services and include both the direct costs
and support costs relating to these activities. . : .

The charitable company recognises the cost of contractual redundancy payments as being part of the cost of the delivery
of charitable activities.

Governance costs include those incurred in the governance of the charity and its assets and are primarily associated with
constitutional and statutory requirements.

Support costs include the central functions and have been allocated to activity cost categories on a basis consistent with
the use of resources, e.g., staff costs by the estimated time spent and other costs by their estimated usage.

Irrecoverable VAT is charged against the category of resources expended for which it was incurred.

Taxation
The company is a registered charity and is exempt from taxation on its charitable activities. The subsidiary company has
no tax liability as it donates its taxable profits to the charity under gift aid.

Tangible fixed assets

Fixed assets (excluding investments) are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Assets costing £3,000 or less are
not capitalised. Depreciation is charged by instalments at rates estimated to write off the cost of the asset less any residual
value over the expected useful lives at the following rates:-

2%% per annum on freehold buildings

4% per annum on freehold building improvements
10% per annum on leasehold building improvements
10% to 25% per annum on equipment and vehicles
33'/3% per annum on computer equipment

On disposal of assets in the ordinary course of business adjustments are made to the depreciation charge to reflect
differences between the actual and estimated aggregate depreciation.

Investments
Investments held as fixed assets are revalued at mid-market value at the balance sheet date and the gain or loss taken
to the Statement of Financial Activities.

Pensions — Defined Benefit Scheme .

The defined benefit scheme was closed to new contributions on 31st August 2010. In accordance with paragraph 28.11
of FRS102 the company as a participating employer to the scheme, has recognised the present value of its share of the
agreed contributions on the balance sheet as a liability on a discounted cash flow basis. MGTS’s estimated liability on
31% March 2024 was £1.23m and is recalculated each year, with movements in the liability reflected in the Statement of
Financial Activities and the element relating to the unwinding of the discount in interest payable. The Company has
renegotiated its recovery plan as a result of the latest actuarial valuation on 31 March 2023.

Further information in relation to an update on the current status of the pension scheme deficit and the most recent
valuation can be found in note 12 on page 23.

The Company is liable for its own funding obligations and is also liable for those of the other sponsoring employers,
should those sponsoring employers default on their obligations.

Pension costs - Defined Contribution Scheme

The amount charged to the Statement of Financial Activities in respect of pension costs is the contribution payable in
the year. Any differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown as either
accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.

12 Pensions

The Company provides pensions for its employees through participation in the Engineering Employers’ Federation
Staff Pension Fund (the Fund), which is governed by a Trustee Board and maintained independently of the
Company’s finances for defined benefit members. There is a separate Master Trust for defined contribution
members, which is also operated independently of the Company: The Fund was established 'to enable a number of
autonomous but related employers to operate a scheme through the sharing of risk within a wider membership base.
As such it is not possible for an underlying employer to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities. For
multi-employer schemes where this is the case, paragraph 28.40A of FRS102 requires that Midland Group Training
Services Limited account for its share of the present value of the agreed pension contributions payable to the scheme
and where contributions are affected by a surplus or deficit in the scheme, to disclose information about the surplus
or deficit and the implications of the surplus or deficit to the Company.

2023 Valuation
At the date of the last completed valuation of the fund (31S' March 2023), the market value of the Fund’s assets

amounted to £143m. The valuation was carried out by an independent qualified actuary adopting a market-based
approach using the projected unit method and the following main assumptions:

Single equivalent average rates % per
(in practise term-dependent curves are used) Annum
Rate of investment retum (initial portfolio) 5.1
Rate of investment return (long term portfolio) 4.3
Rate of price inflation 3.6 (RPI)
Rate of increase in salaries n/a
Rate of pension increases:

RPI up to 5% 3.5
RPI up to 5%: minimum 3% 3.8
CPI up to 5% 3.1
CPI up to 2.5% 2.1

As at the valuation date these assets were insufficient, on the assumptions adopted, to meet the cost of the Fund’s
accrued liabilities. The Fund had a deficit of £19m on an ongoing funding basis.

The split between participating employers was re-evaluated on 31 March 2023 based on updated assumptions,
resulting in the proportion attributed to MGTS’s members decreasing to £1.3m (6.7%) 2020: 8.3%.

Subsequently, participating employers agreed contribution schedules with the Trustee that are expected to be
sufficient to eliminate their share of the revised deficit over a period acceptable to the Trustee. Under this agreement
Midland Group Training Services Limited is liable to make the following contributions in respect of its share of the
deficit in the defined benefits section:

Amount Dates Frequency
£192,220 Payable on Ist April 2023. One off
£170,000 pa Payable from 1st April 2024 to 31st March 2031 inclusive. This will Annually

be increased by 2% each year.

In addition, the Company has granted an uncapped charge to the Trustee of the Fund, over the freehold property at
Gulson Road, Coventry included in the Balance Sheet at 31 March 2024 at £1.2m (see note 8 page 20). It should be
noted that the defined benefit scheme was closed to all future accruals during 2010.
