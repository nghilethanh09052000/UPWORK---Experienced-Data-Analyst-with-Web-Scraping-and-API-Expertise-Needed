Directors’ report (Continued)
For the financial year ended 30 June 2024

Going concern

The directors have prepared cash flow forecasts and projected the funding requirements of the
Company for at least the next 12 months. The directors are satisfied that the Company has adequate
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future on the grounds that the
ultimate parent company (The College of Law Limited) has committed to provide financial support.
This financial support will include advancing amounts to the Company as required to enable the
Company to operate as a going concern and settle its liabilities as they fall due.

Qualifying third party indemnity provisions

The Company maintains liability insurance through a qualifying third party indemnity provision
covering the directors and officers of the Company. This third-party indemnity was in force during the
financial year and also at the date of approval of the financial statements.

Statement of directors’ responsibilities in respect of the financial statements

The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Financial Report and the financial statements
in accordance with applicable law and regulation.

Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that
law the directors have prepared the financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 102
“The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland”, and applicable law).

Under company taw, directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that
they give.a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of the profit or loss of the
company for that period. In preparing the financial statements, the directors are required to:

e¢ select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;

e state whether applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 102 have
been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial
statements;

¢ make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and

® prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to
presume that the company will continue in business.

The directors are responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and hence for taking
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

The directors are also responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show
and explain the company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial
position of the company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the
Companies Act 2006.

corporate governance provides an overview of governance at the College, including the processes by
which we ensure transparency, enable the student voice to be heard, manage risk, and assure the
application of robust internal controls. The Chair of the Board of Directors (“the Board”) takes a leading
role in ensuring that good governance is exercised by the College.

The College’s governance arrangements are set out in the Articles of Association and Corporate

conducts its business in accordance. with the seven “Nolan” principles of public life, namely
selflessness, integrity, objectivity, accountability, openness, honesty and leadership and are guided in
doing this by the Independent Higher Education (“IHE”) Code of Governance (“the Code”). The College
is also committed to upholding the public interest governance principles set out by the OfS.

Corporate Governance Structures

The Board

Our governing body is the Board.

The UK Companies Act 2006 establishes that the Board is ultimately responsible for all matters relating
to the running of the College. The Board is ultimately responsible under the Articles of Association for
the management of the business of the College and to do all things necessary in order to carry out the
objectives of the College. ‘

The Board delegates management functions in general to the Senior Executive and to select senior
managers for specific purposes and it is the role of the Senior Executive and other delegates to manage

the College in accordance with the directions of the Board.

The Board authorises the Programme Committee to oversee all curriculum, academic policy and
quality matters, while retaining ultimate authority in those areas.

The College's Board is structured to add value. Good governance principles require independence,
transparency and flexibility.

The Board considers the current Directors have an appropriate mix of skills to enable the Board to
effectively discharge its responsibilities.

Programme Committee
The Programme Committee is the senior Academic Committee.
The Programme Committee has delegated authority from the Board to ensure the maintenance of

academic standards of the College, and to advise the Senior Executive and the Board on all academic
matters. A new student representative has been appointed to the committee.

Risk, Audit and Compliance Committee (“ARCC”)

The ARCC monitors the current areas of greatest strategic, business, operational, financial and
compliance risk along with risk management strategies and ensures management is effectively
managing the risks. The ARCC is required to satisfy itself that effective systems of accounting and
internal control (including management control systems and policies) are established and maintained
to enable it to manage the College’s strategic, business, operational, financial and compliance risks
The ARCC, on behalf of the Board, ensures that there are adequate and effective arrangements in
place to provide transparency about value for money for students and, where appropriate, for
taxpayers, and advises the Board of all matters relating to value for money.

management of the College, through the Senior Executive, advises the Board on policies and
objectives, devises means of meeting the agreed objectives, and is held accountable for implementing

Statement of Internal Control

As our Governing Body, the Board has responsibility for maintaining a sound system of internal control
that supports the achievement of policies, aims and objectives, while safeguarding the public funds
and assets for which it is responsible. The Board acts in accordance with the responsibilities assigned
to it in our Articles of Association and Corporate Governance Code, and the regulatory framework
published by the OfS, including the ongoing Conditions of Registration, and terms and conditions of
funding.

The system of internal control is based on an ongoing process, evidenced in the work of the College’s
governance committees and Senior Executive, which is designed to identify the risk to the
achievement of policies and objectives. In particular, the College has the following processes for the
management of risk and reviewing the effectiveness of its system of internal control:

« The Board meets at least four times a year to consider strategic goals, progress against
business plan and to hear from the Senior Executive on the management of the College.

* The Board delegates oversight and monitoring responsibilities for operational risk
management of the College to the ARCC and Senior Executive. The ARCC meets at least four
times a year.

« The College Risk Register covers all forms of processes and risk governance, management,
quality, compliance, reputational and financial. Included in the Risk Register is the Prevent
Duty Register and Action Plan. The Board receives from the ARCC an update on the Corporate
and Prevent Risk Register at each of its meetings.

« The Board reviews the effectiveness of the risk management process and internal controls
via receipt of verbal reports and minutes from ARCC throughout the year.

e The ARCC commissions internal ‘Deep Dives’ when required into defined areas of the College
to audit the arrangements, methodology and operational effectiveness of the area, as well as
recommending improvements. a

e The Senior Executive completes bi-annual compliance attestation process for the ARCC and
Board, outlining any areas of non-compliance or internal control failure, impacts and
mitigating actions.

This system of internal control is designed to manage, rather than remove, the risk of failure across
the College to meet business and strategic plans and regulatory requirements. It provides a robust
and reasonable, but not an absolute, assurance of effectiveness and also a check on the continuing
effectiveness and relevance of our internal policies.

The College makes use of a well-established and tested risk management framework, which is used
across the COL Group. The key risk management document is the Risk Register. It enables the Senior
Executive to focus on the key risks that threaten the College’s ability to meet its objectives, based
on the potential impact of the risks and their likelihood. The Senior Executive focus on the residual
risks in key risk areas and consider mitigating controls and other.actions rather than focusing on
contingency plans for many inherent risks.

At each ARCC meeting, the ARCC receives the Risk Register from the Senior Executive, along with a
report setting out the three highest risk areas for the College. The ARCC explore with the Senior
Executive the development of mitigating actions on some of the key risk areas. ARCC subsequently
reports on these key risk areas to the Board. The Risk Register also includes the Prevent Duty Risk
Register and Action Plan for 2023/24. .

At an operational management level, the College embeds effective risk management into its day-
to- day operations. The Senior Executive of the College has a standing agenda item around ‘Risk and
Compliance’ in their monthly meetings, in which it shares and discusses any key information. The
Senior Executive also discuss on a monthly basis the performance of the College against business
plan KPis, including financial, student experience, curriculum development and resource allocation.

College of Legal Practice Limited

Alive reporting dashboard has now been set up which gives up to date information covering student
enrolments and revenue.

The College’s Chief Operations Director is responsible for ensuring internal contro! around any
public funding the College receives from the OfS. Given the relatively small numbers of students
enrolled on courses in the year was modest, the level of recurrent funding received from the OfS
remains small. Nonetheless, the Chief Operations Director is accountable to the Board for ensuring
proper use of public funds received from the OfS, ensuring the regularity and propriety of the use
of public funding.

The system of internal control, according with guidance from the OfS, allows the College to manage
risk efficiently, effectively, and economically. This process has been in place for the year ended 30
June 2024 and, up to the date of approval of the financial statements, has operated effectively
throughout the year.

College of Legal Practice Limited

Independent auditors’ report to the Governing Body of
the College of Legal Practice Limited (the “institution”)

Report on the audit of the financial statements

Opinion
In our opinion, the College of Legal Practice Limited’s financial statements (the “financial statements”):
e give a true and fair view of the state of the institution’s affairs as at 30 June 2024 and of its

income and expenditure, gains and losses, changes in equity and cash flows for the year then
ended;

e have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 102 “The
Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland”, and applicable
law);

e have been properly prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Office for Students’
Accounts Direction (OfS 2019.41); and

e have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Financial Report (the “Annual
Report”), which comprise the Balance sheet as at 30 June 2024; the Statement of comprehensive
income, the Statement of changes in equity, and the Statement of cash flows for the year then ended;
and the notes to the financial statements, which include a description of the significant accounting
policies.

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”)
and applicable law. Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’
responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We believe that the audit
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Independence

We remained independent of the institution in accordance with the ethical requirements that are
relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard,
and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

Conclusions relating to going concern

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to
events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the parent
institution’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from the date
on which the financial statements are authorised for issue.

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the Governing body’s use of the going
concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this conclusion is not a
guarantee as to the institution’s ability to continue as a going concern.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the Governing body with respect to going concern are
described in the relevant sections of this report.

Reporting on other information

The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial
statements and our auditors’ report thereon. The Governing Body are responsible for the other
information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and,
accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in
this report, any form of assurance thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with
the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially

10

College of Legal Practice Limited

misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required
to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements
ora material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we
conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that
fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.

With respect to the Directors’ Report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the
Companies Act 2006 have been included.

Based on our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006 requires us also to
report certain opinions and matters as described below.

Directors’ Report

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the
Director’s Report for the year ended 30 June 2024 is consistent with the financial statements and has
been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

In light of the knowledge and understanding of the institution and their environment obtained in the
course of the audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in the Directors’ Report.

Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit

Responsibilities of the Governing Body for the financial statements

As explained more fully in the Statement of director’s responsibilities in respect of the financial
statements set out on page 3, the Governing Body (who are also the directors of the institution for the
purposes of company law) are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance
with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The Governing
Body is also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the
preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or
error.

In preparing the financial statements, the Governing Body are responsible for assessing the
institution’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Governing Body either intends to
liquidate the institution or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an
audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it,
exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the
basis of these financial statements.

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design
procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect
of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting
irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below.

Based on our understanding of the institution/industry, we identified that the principal risks of non-
compliance with laws and regulations related to Office for Students regulations, and we considered the
extent to which non-compliance might have a material effect on the financial statements. We also
considered those laws and regulations that have a direct impact on the financial statements such as the
Office for Students’ Accounts Direction (OfS 2019.41) and the Companies Act 2006. We evaluated
management’s incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the financial statements
(including the risk of override of controls), and determined that the principal risks were related tothe
posting of inappropriate journal entries designed to overstate the financial performance and/or
position of the institution. Audit procedures performed included:

e holding enquiries of management including consideration of any known or suspected
instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations and fraud;

* reviewing relevant meeting minutes including those of the Governing Body; and

¢ identifying and testing journal entries, in particular those posted with unusual account
combinations.

There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above. We are less likely to become
aware of instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations that are not closely related to events

11

College of Legal Practice Limited

and transactions reflected in the financial statements. Also, the risk of not detecting a material
misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud
may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or
through collusion.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the
Financial Reporting Council's website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description
forms part of our auditors’ report.

Notes to the financial statements
For the financial year ended 30 June 2024

1. General information
The College of Legal Practice Limited (the Company) is a legal education and training provider.

The Company is a private company limited by shares and is incorporated in the United
Kingdom and registered in England. The address of its registered office is C/O Pinsent Masons
Secretarial Limited, 1 Park Row, Leeds, LS1 5AB, United Kingdom.

2. Statement of compliance

The financial statements of College of Legal Practice Limited have been prepared in
compliance with United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including Financial Reporting
Standard 102, ‘The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the United Kingdom and the
Republic of Ireland’ (‘FRS 102’) and the Companies Act 2006.

3. Summary of accounting policies
3.1 Basis of preparation of financial statements

The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical
cost convention and in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102, the Financial
Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and the Republic of Ireland {"FRS 102") and the
Companies Act 2006. These have also been prepared in accordance with the Accounts
Direction issued by the Office for Students (OfS).

The preparation of financial statements in compliance with FRS 102 requires the use of
certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise judgement in
applying the Company's accounting policies.

The following principal accounting policies have been applied consistently throughout the
year:

3.2 Going concern

The directors have prepared cash flow forecasts and projected the funding requirements of
the Company for at least the next 12 months. The directors are satisfied that the Company
has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future on
the grounds that the parent has committed to provide financial support. This financial
support will include advancing amounts to the Company as required to enable the Company
to operate as a going concern and settle its liabilities as they fall due.

Summary of accounting policies (continued)
3.3 Foreign currency translation

Functional and presentation currency
The Company's functional and presentational currency is pound sterling (GBP).

Transactions and balances

All foreign currency transactions during the financial year are brought to account using the
exchange rate in effect at the date of the transaction. Foreign currency monetary items at
reporting date are translated at the exchange rate existing at reporting date. Non-monetary
assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are
translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.

Exchange differences are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in the
period in which they arise.

3.4 Revenue recognition
Rendering of services

Revenue is recognised in the year the seminar/course is run. Revenue is apportioned and
calculated by the stage of completion if the seminar/course spans two financial periods.
Revenue that is not recognised in the statement of comprehensive income, being not yet
earned, is recorded on the statement of financial position as Current liabilities - Deferred
income.

Investment revenue
Interest income is accrued on a time basis by reference to the principal outstanding and at
the effective interest rate applicable.

3.5 Employee benefits and Pensions

Provision is made for benefits accruing to employees in respect of wages and salaries, annual
leave and other entitlements when it is probable that settlement will be required and they
are capable of being measured reliably. oe

Provisions made in respect of employee benefits expected to be settled within 12 months are
measured at their nominal values using the remuneration rate expected to apply at the

time of settlement. Where benefits are not expected to be settled within 12 months are
measured as the present value of the estimated future cash outflows to be made up to the
reporting date.

Company pays fixed pension contributions into external pension plans identified by the
employees. Once the contributions have been paid the Company has no further payment
obligations.

The pension contributions are recognised as an expense in the Statement of Comprehensive
income when they fall due. Amounts not paid are shown in accruals as a liability in the
Statement of financial position. The assets of the plan are held separately from the Company
in independently administered funds.

Summary of accounting policies (continued)
3.6 Taxation

Current tax

Current tax is calculated by reference to the amount of income taxes payable or recoverable
in respect of the taxable profit or tax loss for the period. It is calculated using tax rates and
tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by reporting date. Current tax for
current and prior periods is recognised as a liability (or asset) to the extent that it is unpaid
(or refundable).

Deferred tax

Deferred tax, if recognised is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method in respect
of temporary differences arising between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the
financial statements and the corresponding tax base of those assets.

In principle, deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary timing differences.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable
amounts will be available against which deductible temporary differences or unused tax
losses and tax offsets can be utilised. However, deferred tax assets and liabilities are not
recognised if the temporary differences giving rise to them arise from the initial recognition
of assets and liabilities (other than as a result of a business combination) which affects neither
taxable income nor accounting profit. Furthermore, a deferred tax liability is not recognised
in relation to taxable temporary differences arising from goodwill. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply'to the period(s) when the
asset and liability giving rise to them are realised or settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws)
that have been enacted or substantively enacted by reporting date.

Current and deferred tax for the period

Current and deferred tax are recognised as an expense or income in the statement of
comprehensive income, except when it relates to items credited or debited directly to equity,
in which case the deferred tax or current tax is also recognised directly in equity, or where it
arises from the initial accounting for a business combination, in which case it is taken into
account in the determination of goodwill or excess.

3.7 Share capital

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of
new ordinary shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the
proceeds.

3.8 Related party transactions

The Company has taken advantage of the exemptions as provided by section 33.1A of FRS

102 from disclosing related party transactions with its’ parent or with members of the same
group that are wholly owned.

3. Summary of accounting policies (continued)
3.9 Debtors

Debtors that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market
are classified as debtors which are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less any allowance for
expected credit losses.

3.10 Cash and deposits with financial institutions

For the purpose of presentation, cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, highly
liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are
subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.

3.11 Creditors

Creditors are initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost
using the effective interest rate method. They represent liabilities for goods and services
which were unpaid at the end of the financial year.

3.12 Basic financial instruments

The Group has chosen to adopt Sections 11 and 12 of FRS 102 in respect of financial
instruments.

Basic financial instruments comprise of debtors, creditors and cash. These instruments are
recognised initially at transaction price less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to
Initial recognition, they are measured at amortised cost using the effective Interest method,
less any impairment losses In the case of financial assets: If the arrangement constitutes a
financing transaction, for example if payment is deferred beyond normal business terms, then
it Is measured at the present value of future payments discounted at a market rate of
instrument for a similar debt instrument.

The amortised cost of a financial asset or liability is the amount at which the financial asset
or liability is measured at Initial recognition, minus principal repayments, plus or minus the
cumulative amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference between the
initial amount recognised and the maturity amount, minus any reduction for impairment.

The Company derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows
from the asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a
transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial
asset are transferred or In which the Company neither transfers no retains substantially all
the risks and rewards of ownership and does not retain control of the financial asset. On
derecognition of a financial asset, the difference between the carrying amount of the asset
(or the carrying amount allocated to the proportion of the asset that is derecognised) and the
consideration received (including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed) is
recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. Any interest in such transferred
financial assets that is created or retained by the Company is recognised as a separate asset
or liability. The Company derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are
discharged or cancelled, or expire.

3.13 Property, plant and equipment

Initial recording

All items of property, plant and equipment are initially recognised at cost in the statement of
financial position. Cost includes the value of consideration exchanged, or fair value in the case
of donated or subsidised assets, and those costs directly attributable to bringing the item to
working condition for its intended use.

Subsequent expenditure

Subsequent expenditure relating to an item of property, plant and equipment is capitalised
to the initial cost of the item when the expenditure increases the economic benefits over the
life of the item or where that expenditure was necessarily incurred to enable the future
economic benefits to be obtained and the expenditure would have been included in the initial
cost of the item had the expenditure been incurred at the time of acquisition.

All other subsequent expenditure is expensed in the period in which it is incurred.

Impairment

At each balance date, the carrying amount of assets is reviewed to determine whether there
is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the
asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the
carrying amount is assessed to be greater than its recoverable amount, the item is written
down to its recoverable amount. The write-down is recognised in the statement of
comprehensive income.

Depreciation

All items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis, at rates
which will write off their cost or re-valued amount less estimated residual value,

over their expected useful lives.

The following estimated useful lives are used in the calculation of depreciation:

Furniture and equipment: 2-7 years

Disposal

On disposal or permanent withdrawal of an item of property, plant and equipment the
difference between the disposal proceeds (if any) and the carrying amount is recognised in
the statement of comprehensive income.

3.14 Provisions

All provisions are recorded at the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the
obligation at balance date.

4. Critical judgements in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation
uncertainty

in the application of the Company’s accounting policies, management is required to make
judgements, estimates and assumptions about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are
not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are
based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual
results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are
reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period
in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the
revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Management have concluded that there are no significant judgments or key areas of
estimation uncertainty.
