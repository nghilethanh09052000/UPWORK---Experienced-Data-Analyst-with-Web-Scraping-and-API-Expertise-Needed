the Chief Executive supported by the Executive Leadership Team (ELT) which consists of the following
roles, each with responsibility for defined functions:

_¢ Group Director of Finance & Corporate Services
¢ National Delivery Director , : : oo
Key Management Personnel Remuneration .

The key management personnel of the charity include the Trustees and the ELT. The Trustees of the -
charity give their time freely and are not remunerated. te

The Chief Executive's remuneration is set annually by the Remuneration & Nominations Committee.

" The Remuneration & Nominations Committee is made up of the Chairman and three other trustees

nominated by the ECA, Unite the Union and the independent directors. It is the responsibility of the
Remuneration Committee to set the pay of the Executive Directors.

The Remuneration Committee also has responsibility to consider the recommendation of the Chief 5
Executive regarding the overall remuneration of the organisation. This recommendation is based on
organisational and staff performance, market testing conducted by the Group Director of Finance &
Corporate Services, Consumer Price Index data and feedback from the members on their likely pay
awards. The decision of the Remuneration & Nominations Committee is then applied through a.
performance related pay process led by the Chief Executive and ELT.

Employees .

The average monthly full-time equivalent number of employees of STL for the year ended 31% July 2024
- was 370 (2023: 388)

JTL communicates with its staff through a number of channels including regular executive vlogs,
-webinars, newsletters, ELT meetings, other manager and staff meetings, a staff forum and the intranet.
‘as well as an annual staff conference.

JTL ensures that no discrimination is shown on the grounds of any protected characteristics such as:-
race, colour, nationality, ethnic or national origin, gender, gender reassignment religion or belief,
sexual orientation, age, marital status including civil partnerships, pregnancy and maternity, caring
responsibilities or disability (the latter is subject to the industry's safety requirements).

_ Rewarding everyone fairly, regardless of gender, is at the heart of the leadership team's agenda.
However, women are under-represented in the building services engineering sector and assessors are

, required to be occupationally competent in their discipline, which currently limits the number of
female applicants. Our gender split is currently 75% male and 25% female which reflects JTL's reliance
ona nationwide team of predominantly male occupationally competent assessors.

Public benefit Statement

"The Trustees have had regard to their responsibilities in demonstrating public benefit as set out in
guidance provided by the Charity Commission. The charity has and continues to demonstrate a number
of areas of public benefit within its core charitable objective of the advancement of education, in the
form of advanced apprenticeship training, achieving high levels of success through the support and
mentoring offered throughout the typically four-year apprenticeship period.

‘Given the challenges faced during and following the pandeniic; JTL has paid particular attention to
mental health support for its learners, many of whom were badly affected by the uncertainties of the —
situation and the impact on their learning, employment and family circumstances. JTL partners with the
Electrical Industries Charity to offer targeted support for individuals in particular need.

The impact on beneficiaries is through the training of persons employed in, or wishing to enter, the
building services engineering sector to obtain qualifications for life. In doing so this ensures the success
and prosperity of the sector by supporting and improving an appropriately trained and skilled
workforce. The high achievement rates of JTL apprentices are a good indicator of the effectiveness of
its programmes and therefore the value for money obtained for the public purse.

: JTL also continues to offer its employer grant schemes including an adoption grant for employers who
take on apprentices who have been made redundant during their apprenticeship to help them
complete their apprenticeship successfully.

JTL provides all its apprentices with free, high-quality textbooks, learning materials and toolkits to
support their progress and achievement without the need to incur the costs associated with such
purchases. ,

All apprenticeship courses are e fully accessible and available free of charge to its learners, as the costs
are met by the government and employers or are underwritten by JTL’s charitable furids.

- STL offers our apprentices a chance to stay in touch and continue their development through JTL
Toolbox, a free online support package specifically aimed at employers and those who have completed
or are near to completing their apprenticeship. Power Up is a CPD platform within Toolbox which offers
free taster training sessions to electricians which will help them in their day- to-day job role and support
their continued professional training need.

JTL has also introduced LEDA, a new digital learning resource. LEDA is an award-winning platform which
has been developed by JTL to provide apprentices with access to learning resources from induction to
bespoke apprenticeship resources including preparing apprentices for their end point :
assessment. Since the introduction of LEDA JTL has enrolled over 10,000 users with further -
development underway to create JTL Advance which will support CPD for all employers and
apprentices through their ce career.

are already being realised. ;

e The move away from company cars and internal combustion engines continues with the ceasing of
company cars and the introduction of the electric and hybrid (,75g) car salary sacrifice scheme.

.© All new centres have energy efficient measures built in and include as a minimum, low energy
lighting schemes, combined VRF heating and cooling systems where economically practical,
improved insulation and water consumption reduction measures..

STRATEGIC REPORT
ACHIEVEMENTS AND PERFORMANCE

JTL Management

A Business Plan was agreed for 2023/24 which focused on a restructure of the company’s operating
model and embedding high quality practices that delivered apprenticeships in a financially sustainable
delivery model. This work was framed around the vision to be the training organisation of choice to the
building services engineering sector and delivering the best learning experience for our apprentices and
their employers. :

wll JTL Statistics
During the year JTL: ;
‘© recruited 2,190 (2023: 2,630) apprentices.
e delivered 1,493 (2023: 1,351) apprentice achievements.
e market share in the core electrotechnical discipline i is 26% (2023: 28.2%)

} According to ESFA published data, JTL's overall achievement rate was 64. 1% (2022/23: 63.4%).
This compares with a national average across all apprenticeships of 51.2%.

e =At31% July 2024, JTL had 7,774 (2023: 8,147) apprentices in training.

ee) JTL Centres and Subcontractor s/ College Partners

‘JTL continues to fund subcontracted fees for its apprentices in training who do not attend a JTL centre

to enable them to successfully complete the appropriate off-the- job learning elements of the

apprenticeship. JTL employs occupationally qualified and competent field staff who regularly monitor,
_ review and assess the apprentices’ progress. ,

The new business model for JTL will seek to prioritise delivery of off-the-job learning from its own
centres and where this is not possible, to work with preferred delivery partners where the quality is
good, and it meets employer needs. JTL will continue to rebalance the use of subcontractors through:
increasing the utilisation of its own centres.

@ Quality

Quality is a key factor in evaluating the impact of our training on both employers and apprentices. The.
Education Inspection Framework, annual Self-Assessment Report and Quality Improvement Plan form a
key foundation of JTL's quality activities, ensuring that our training programmes deliver a high quality
learning experience that benefits both apprentices and employers. In August 2023, JTL was re-
inspected by Ofsted and once again achieved a "Grade 2 - Good" inspection report. JTL's focus on the
quality of its provision results in it continuing to have achievement rates well above the national
_ average in its core disciplines of électrotechnical and plumbing

In addition, JTL holds BS EN ISO 9001:2015 for quality management systems, the Matrix standard for
Information, Advice and Guidance and Committed 2 Equality's Gold standard for Equality.

JTL employs a rolling internal audit and quality assurance programme which includes ongoing
monitoring of delivery partners in line with the ESFA Subcontracting Standard as well as JTL’s quality
standards.

Equality, Diversity and Safeguarding ~

JTLis committed to a policy of equality and diversity for everyone. No applicant for a training scheme

_ place with JTL, apprentice, customer or member of staff shall knowingly receive less favourable

treatment on the grounds of their protected characteristics, nor will any other condition or

- requirement that cannot be justified disadvantage them.

JTL is also committed to safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children and young people and
expects all staff to share this commitment.

The building services engineering industry is generally regarded as a white, male industry and JTL.

_ continues to address this stereotyping through its growing apprentice ambassador scheme which sees

existing female and ethnic minority apprentices working with schools and at careers events to promote
the opportunities in the industry as well as to network with each other. Ambassadors have also taken
to social media to promote the industry and benefits of apprenticeships. :

ee FINANCIAL REVIEW

The JTL strategy set out by the Executive Leadership Team includes, as one of its three objectives, a
strategic objective of achieving financial sustainability. This included specifically delivering
improvement from the previous year and the aim being to break even by July 2025.

The principal funding source is the Department for Education's Education and Skills Funding Agency.
The charity uses this income source to further its aims and objectives including increasing apprentice
learner numbers and enhancing and innovating its provision.

No fundraising is carried out and any income from investments is generated via a responsible and
ethical approach implemented by the Investment Managers, Barclays.

' The Consolidated Statement of Financial Activities for the year shows an operating loss for the year of
' £1,954,653 (2023: Loss £4,226,283) after losses on property revaluation of £360,104 (2023: |

£2,785,854). The revaluation reserve at the year-end was £2,633,068 (2023:£2,657,472). Net movement in funds .
for the year amounted to a gain of £1,646,802 (2023: loss of£1,236, 428) after investment gains of £3,625,859 _
(2023: £332,382), and losses on property revaluation of

£384,508 (2023: gains £2,657,472).

This resulted in a net asset position, all held as unrestricted funds as at 31st July 2024, of £42,975,197
(2023: £41,328,395). The Trustees are satisfied with the net asset position at the year end and are

The current reserves policy requires that unrestricted funds held by the charity should be more than six .
months £24,487,920 (2023: £24,309,511) and less than twelve months £48,975, 840 (2023: £48, 619,022)
of the resources expended. After allowing for factors detailed in Charity Commission guidance for best
practice, the charity's reserves are in line with this policy. At this level the charity would be able to
continue to honour its commitments to employers and learners until appropriate alternative -
arrangements can be made. ,

The Trustees consider that in light of the above and the current economic climate, the amount in
reserves is appropriate. :

Principal Risks and Uncertainties

Saeeees

The Board ensures, through the specific delegation of responsibilities, that the Executive Management ‘
Team will manage significant business risks through a combination of risk identification, analysis,
evaluation, control and action planning so as to contain risk within limits acceptable to the Board.

In line with JTL’s risk management policy and framework, risks are logged on JTL’s risk register and
reviewed regularly. The most significant risks are then reviewed and discussed monthly by the
-Executive Management Team and quarterly by the Finance, Audit & Risk Committee and reported to
the Board. — ;

The most significant risks currently identified are:

¢ Learners fail to achieve their qualification resulting in low achievement rates and removal of
ESFA funding due to insufficient contact, insufficient assessment, poor teaching and lack of
pastoral engagement having negative consequences on teamer safeguarding and wellbeing...

e Failure to invest in change management and failure to embed the required transition to deliver
improved quality and financial sustainability in line with the strategic objectives resulting in
inadequate systems, cultural divergence and resulting poor performance leading to poor
quality provision and sub-optimal attainment for apprentices.

© Failure to ensure that funds invested by the charity in the trading subsidiary (Develop Training
Limited) generate sustained returns on investments.

The Trustees have assessed these major risks and are satisfied that adequate steps are being taken to
mitigate exposure and reduce the risks. : ,

nw Plans for future periods —

JTL's core business is delivering high quality. apprenticeships to the building services engineering sector.
In 2023, after consultation with employers, learners and stakeholders, JTL published its Corporate
Strategy which will focus.on three key priorities as follows:

e deliver a high-quality apprenticeship, create and maintain a financially sustainable business and
~ adapt and innovate to meet the changing needs of the industry. :

Trustees’ Annual Report (Including Strategic Report) : POWERING

Year Ended 31% July 2024

The restructure of the organisation that was implemented during the year was a significant step ,
towards achieving the objectives. JTL will now move to embed this structure and consolidate the good
practices it has identified to deliver quality outcomes for learners. JTL has maintained the position with
regards to growth and will look to focus on developing and delivering for the apprentices before
returning to growth next year. Whilst growth will be on a small scale in 2025/26 it will then accelerate

- in the following two years (years four and five of the strategic plan). At the same time, it remains
committed to consolidating its provision on its traditional electrical market and reviewing how best to
offer plumbing on a sustainable basis. °

Furthermore, JTL intends to continue reviewing and improving its delivery strategy and will look to
establish-:more of its own centres in target areas to best meet the needs of employers and learners. JTL
remains committed to the implementation of a technology strategy and has set out a digital journey.
This includes increased alignment and automation of systems and processes: based around the LEAN
principles.

As part of this restructuring and refocusing of its business, JTL will also continue to improve the Group”
dynamics in order to increase synergy between the businesses developing the shared services model
through a central group services model. Training relevant to the post-apprenticeship sector of the
workforce will be taken forward through JTL's training centres, addressing the known training and CPD
needs of the electrical sector through greater targeting of its commercial course offerings. Governance
control across the Group will also ensure that the quality, financial Sustainability and innovation
aspirations are driven forward across all group entities.

Underpinning everything will be the focus on the quality of provision and ensuring that the
expectations of our customers, learners, funding bodies and the industry are not only met but
exceeded. In doing this JTL also wants to be an enjoyable, fulfilling and exciting place to work, an
organisation which people are proud to be part of and one which rewards excellence and achievement. .

JTL continues to monitor external opportunities for partnership and acquisition as long as these
support the JTL objectives, ethos and the overall business strategy.

Going Concern

__ The Trustees have assessed the latest financial results and future forecasts to ensure the charity has

_ adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. The improvements
to date and planned work going forward provide assurance on the financial sustainability of the group.
For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF JTL

Opinion , . . . : . -

We have audited the financial statements of JTL (the ‘parent charitable company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘group’)-for the
year ended 31 July 2024 which comprise the Consolidated statement of financial activities, the Consolidated balance sheet,
the Company balance sheet, the Consolidated statement of cash flows and the related notes, including a summary of
significant accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law
and United Kingdom.Accounting Standards, including:-Financial Reporting Standard 102 'The Financial Reporting Standard
applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland’ (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

In our opinion the financial statements:

° give a true and fair view of the state of the Group's and of the parent charitable company's affairs as at 31 July 2024.
and of the Group's incoming resources and application of resources, including its income and expenditure for the
year then ended; :
have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and:

have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. °

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and ‘applicable law. Our
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial

_ Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are

televant to our audit of the financial.statements in the United Kingdom, including the Financial Reporting Council's Ethical

Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the

audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Conclusions relating to going concern

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the Trustees’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in
the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. .

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions

- that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group's or the parent charitable company's ability to

continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for
issue.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the Trustees with respect to going concern are described in the relevant
sections of this report.

Other information
, 3

The other information comprises the information included in the Annual report other ‘than the financial statements and our
Auditors’ report thereon. The Trustees are responsible for the other information contained within the Annual report. Our
opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated
in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. Our responsibility is to read the other
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements
or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such
material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a
material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. tf, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that
there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF JTL (CONTINUED)

Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

« "the information given in the Trustees’ report including the Strategic report for the financial year for which the fil nancial ,

statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
. the Trustees’ report and the Strategic report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

Matters on which we are required to report by exception

In the light of our knowledge and understanding of the charitable company and its environment obtained in the course of the
audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the Trustees’ report including the Strategic report.

We have nothing to report it in respect of the following matters in relation to which Companies Act 2006 requires us to report .
to you if, in our opinion:

. the parent charitable company has not kept adequate and sufficient accounting records, or returns adequate for our
audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or

the parent charitable company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
certain disclosures of Trustees’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or

we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

Responsibilities of trustees

As explained more fully in the. Trustees’ responsibilities statement, the Trustees (who are also the directors of the charitable
company for the purposes of company law) are responsible for the preparation of thé financial statements and for being
satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the Trustees determine is necessary to enable
the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the Trustees are responsible for assessing the Group's and the parent charitable
company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the
going concern basis of accounting unless the Trustees either intend to liquidate the Group ¢ or the parent charitable company
or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

JTL
(A company limited by guarantee)

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF JTL (CONTINUED)

Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an Auditors' report that includes ‘our opinion. Reasonable. -
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will
always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence t the economic decisions of users -

: taken on the basis of these financial statements.

Irregularities, including fraud, are. instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with
our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent
to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below:

¢ The charitable company is subject to laws and regulations that directly affect the financial statements including financial
reporting legislation. We determined. that the following laws and regulations were most significant including the
Companies Act 2006, Charities Act 2011, Employment and Health and Safety legislation, GDPR and the Ofsted
framework. We assessed the extent of compliance with these laws and regulations as part of our procedures on the
related financial statement items.

. We understood how the charitable company is complying with those legal and regulatory frameworks by, making
inquiries to management, those responsible for legal and compliance procedures. We corroborated our inquiries
through our review of board minutes. .

« The engagement partner assessed whether the engagement team collectively had the appropriate competence and
capabilities to identify or recognise non-compliance with laws and regulations. The assessment did not identify any
issues in this area.

We assessed the susceptibility of the Company's financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud
might occur. We considered the opportunities and incéntives that may exist within the organisation for fraud and
identified the greatest potential for fraud in the following areas: payments to fictitious employees, claims for non-
existent apprentices, payments to fictious suppliers, the posting of unusual journals and complex transactions that
could manipulate the financial results and the use of management override of controls to manipulate results, or to
cause the Company to enter into transactions not in its best interests. .

Audit procedures performed by the engagement team included:
° identifying and assessing the design and effectiveness of controls management has in Place to prevent and detect
” fraud; .
° understanding how those charged with governance ‘considered and addressed the potential for override of: controls
or other inappropriate influence over the financial reporting process;
° challenging assumptions and judgements made by management in its significant accounts estimates; ©
° identifying and testing journal entries, in particular any journal entries posted with unusual account combinations.

Because of the inherent limitations of an audit, there is a risk that we will not detect all irregularities, including those leading
to a material. misstatement in the financial statements or non-compliance with regulation. This risk increases the more that
compliance with a law or regulation is removed from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, as we
will be less likely to become aware of instances of non-compliance. The risk is also greater regarding irregularities occurring
due to fraud rather than error, as fraud involves intentional concealment, forgery, collusion, omission or misrepresentation.

A further description of our responsibilities for. the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting
Council's website at: www. frc.org.uk/auditorsr nsibilities. This description forms part of our Auditors’ report.

(FRS 102) (effective 1- January 2019), the Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of
Ireland (FRS 102) and the Companies Act 2006. : :

JTL meets the definition of a public benefit entity under FRS 102. Assets and liabilities are initially recognised
at historical cost or transaction value unless otherwise stated in the relevant accounting policy.

The significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all years presented unless otherwise stated.

The Company has taken advantage of the éxemption allowed under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006
and has not presented its own Statement of financial activities in these financial statements.

Basis of consolidation

The financial statements consolidate the accounts of JTL and its wholly owned subsidiaries undertakings,
CompEx Certification Limited, Develop Training Group Limited and Develop Training Limited.

The charity has taken advantage of the exemption contained within’ Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not ,
to present its own income and expenditure account. -

Going concern

The trustees have assessed the use of going-concern and have considered possible events or conditions that

_ might cast significant doubt on the ability of the. charity to continue as a going concer, including the ongoing .

and negative financial impact of the financial performance of the subsidiary company Develop Training Limited.
This subsidiary is now following a controlled recovery plan with no additional financial support from the charity’
planned in the next financial year and a forecast providing assurance. that loan repayments will commence as ~
the performance of the subsidiary improves.

The trustees have made this assessment for a period of at least one year from the ‘date of the approval of these
financial statements. The trustees have concluded that there is a reasonable expectation that the Charity has
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. The charity therefore
continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing these fi nancial statements.

Fund accounting

Unrestricted funds are available for use at the discretion of the Trustees in furtherance of the general objectives
of the charity. All funds received during the year were unrestricted.

and iti is probable that the income will be received.

Income from government and other grants are recognised at fair value when the charity has entitlement after
any performance conditions have been met, it is probable that the income will be received, and the amount can
be measured reliably. If entitlement is not met, then these.amounts are deferred. :

Investment income is earned through holding assets for investment purposes such as shares. It includes

_ dividends and interest. Interest income is recognised using the effective interest method and dividend income

is recognised as the charity's right to receive payment is established.

Other income includes gains on disposals of tangible fixed assets, recognised upon completion of the sale:

Expenditure

All expenditure is accounted for on an accruals basis and has been classified under headings that aggregate
all costs related to the category. Expenditure is recognised where there is a legal or constructive obligation to
make payments to third parties, it is probable that the settlement will be required, and the amount of the

obligation can be measured reliably. It is categorised under the following headings:

_* Expenditure on charitable activities comprises costs which directly relate to education and training activities

as well as an allocation of support costs, see note (2.7).
* Costs of raising funds, which includes:

fe} Trading expenditure consists of expenditure relating to the operation of the trading subsidiaries

include office costs, governance costs and administrative payroll costs. They are incurred directly in support of
expenditure on the objects of the charity and include project management carried out at headquarters. Where
support costs cannot be directly attributed to particular headings, they have been allocated to cost of raising
funds and expenditure on charitable activities on a basis consistent with use of the resources.

Intangible assets and amortisation

Intangible fixed assets are stated at cost (or deemed ‘cost) less accumulated depreciation. Cost includes costs
directly attributable to making the asset capable of operating as intended.

Assets costing less than. £1,000 individually are not capitalised and are expended within the year.

Amortisation is provided on ali intangible fixed assets, at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated
tesidual value, of each asset on a systematic basis over its expected useful life. During the year the
amortisation rate applied was:

Software - 25% straight line
Tangible fixed assets and depreciation
With the exception of freehold Property, tangible fixed assets are stated at cost. (or deemed cost) less .
accumulated depreciation. Cost includes costs directly attributable to making the asset capable of operating as
intended. :
Assets costing less than £1,000 individually are not capitalised and are expended within the year.
Depreciation is.provided on all tangible. fixed assets, at rates calculated to write off the’ cost, less estimated

residual value, of each asset\on a systematic basis over its expected useful life. During the year the
depreciation ratés were:

2% straight line
25% straight line

’ Freehold property (Buildings only)
Short-term leasehold property

Motor vehicles - 25% straight line «

Fixtures and fittings - 10% - 25% straight line
~ Computer equipment - - 25% straight line

Software / IT consultancy - 25% _ straight line

No depreciation is provided for on Freehold Land

Change of accounting policy -

During the year a revaluation of freehold buildings was undertaken by Allied Surveyors and Valuers on behalf
of JTL. The information provided has allowed the cost of “land” to be established and accounted for separately.

The split of. land from freehold building will provide a more accurate asset value and- depreciation calculation

, leading to improved fi financial information. Land will no longer be depreciated.

A new depreciation rate of 10% straight line has been created for Fixtures and Fittings and Freehold property:
has been amended from 4% straight line to 2% straight line. Due to the number of adjustments made it is not
possible to state the effect on each line of the financial statements for the current or prior periods.

2.10 Investments

Investments are recognised initially at fair value, which at year end is normaily the transaction price excluding
transaction costs. Subsequently; they are continuously measured at a mark to market at fair value ‘with
changes recognised in 'net gains or losses on investments’ in the consolidated statement of financial activities
if the shares are publicly traded or their fair value can otherwise be measured reliably. Other investments are

" measured at cost less impairment.

Investments in subsidiaries are measured at cost less impairment.

Impairment

Assets not measured at fair value are reviewed for any indication that the asset may be impaired at each
balance sheet date. If such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset, or the asset's cash
generating: unit, is estimated and compared to the carrying amount. Where the carrying amount exceeds its
recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognised in the SoFA unless the asset is carried at a revalued
amount where the impairment loss is a revaluation decrease.

Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the charity has an obligation at the balance sheet date as a result of a past
event, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required in settlement and the amount can be
reliably estimated. -

Leases

Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the Consolidted statement of financial activities on a
straight-line basis over the period of the lease.

Employee benefits

When employees have rendered service to the charity, short-term employee benefits to which the employees
are entitled are recognised at the undiscounted amount expected to be paid in exchange for that service. The
charity operates a defined contribution plan for the benefit of its employees. Contributions are expensed as
they become payable.

Financial instruments ; .

The charity holds basic Financial Instruments. The financial assets and financial liabilities of the Charity are as
follows:

* Financial assets: Trade and other debtors and accrued income are basic financial instruments and are debt
instruments measured at amortised cost as detailed in note 19. Prepayments are not financial instruments.
+ Cash at bank - is classified as a basic financial instrument and is measured at face value.

All other investments are classified as basic financial instruments and held at their fair value.

Financial Liabilities: Trade creditors, accruals and other creditors will be classified as financial instruments and
are measured at amortised cost as detailed in note 20. Basic taxation and social security are not included in
the financial instrument's disclosure. Deferred income is not deemed to be a financial liability, as the cash ~
settlement has already taken place and there is an obligation to deliver charitable services rather than cash or.
another financial instrument.
