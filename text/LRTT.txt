STRATEGIC REPORT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023

The directors present the strategic report for the year ended 31 December 2023.
Review of the business
The company's key financial and other performance indicators during the year were as follows:

Turnover
8,408,997

Turnover for the year increased by 31% compared to 2022. Operating
Profit
improved to
£2
27,861
versus prior year due to
volume growth
, and continued recovery following the adverse impact of Covid-19 in 2021.
Operational efficiency has improved with the record intake of apprentice numbers in the final quarter of 2023 and uptake of spaces on open courses as profuse demand returns. The business has also not only increased business with its existing portfolio of blue-chip customers but also expanded the client base both in the UK and overseas
.
Principal risks and uncertainties
Under normal economic conditions, the company's principal risks relate to interest rates, pricing, credit risk, liquidity and foreign currency. These are described later in this section. As the company emerges from the Covid-19 pandemic, liquidity is no longer a major concern. However, recovery is not yet complete, and financial vigilance
during this rapid growth phase
remains imperative. The impact of Brexit on the company’s trading has not been significant.
Liquidity
While the risks are no longer as severe as during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, vigilance is ongoing with regard to the working capital management. The company actively manages its cash flow.
The directors believe that the cash reserves and its facilities are sufficient to continue trading for the foreseeable future.
LRTT LIMITED
STRATEGIC REPORT (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023
- 3 -
Principal risks and uncertainties
Competitive risk
The company operates in a competitive market.
It has long term contracts and relationships and has developed training materials and excellence in training to
help keep the company ahead of the competition
.
In
t
erest rate risk
Bank
balances
are used on a short-term basis and bear interest at floating rates. Interest is charged at market rates on group loans.
Price risk
The company seeks to minimise any significant exposure to changes in price by
operating long term contracts,
together with competitive tendering where appropriate.
Credit risk
The company aims to mitigate external credit risk by selling to a
blue chip
customer base in different geographical markets
.
Liquidity risk
Cash flows are closely monitored and controlled, including commitments to new
contracts
and capital expenditure. The company operates within a wider group treasury function and group facility
.
In the course of trading the company
trades using m
ainly trades using mainly British Pounds and Euros
.
There are also group loans denominated in foreign currencies
including British Pounds, Euros and Swiss Francs
which
are hedged by netting balances owing between group companies.
Impact of Brexit
While
the company
continue
s
to deal with the impact of Covid-19, it is difficult to assess the impact of Brexit in isolation. The company’s diverse business model in terms of
service
and market geography, mitigates the impact of a localised factor such as Brexit.The training business is seeing a divergence of EASA and UKCAA standards and while this will add additional cost and complexity to the business, it also represents an opportunity for the businesses’ flexible digital products including the Part 66 courseware and exam services.
Impact of Covid-19
The Covid-19 pandemic ha
s had an
adverse impact on the company’s operations
in recent years.
Despite this, the company
has returned to
profitab
ility
during th
e period
, and has recovered strongly as relative normality has returned.

DIRECTORS' RESPONSIBILITIES STATEMENT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023
- 4 -
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of the profit or loss of the company for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
LRTT LIMITED
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF LRTT LIMITED
- 5 -
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of LRTT Limited (the 'company') for the year ended 31 December 2023 which comprise the profit and loss account, the statement of comprehensive income, the balance sheet, the statement of changes in equity and notes to the financial statements, including significant accounting policies.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 102
The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
In our opinion the financial statements:
give a true and fair view of the state of the company's affairs as at 31 December 2023 and of its profit for the year then ended;
have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the
Auditor's
responsibilities for the audit of the
financial statements
section of our report. We are independent of the
company
in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the
financial statements
in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard
, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Conclusions relating to going concern
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.
Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.
Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report.
Other information
The other information comprises the information included in the annual report other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of our audit
:
the information given in the strategic report and the directors'
r
eport for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements
; and
the strategic report and the directors' report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
LRTT LIMITED
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT (CONTINUED)
TO THE MEMBERS OF LRTT LIMITED

Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identifie
d
material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors'
r
eport
.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
certain disclosures of
remuneration specified by law are not made; or
we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the directors'
r
esponsibilities
s
tatement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of
financial statements
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the
financial statements
, the
directors are
responsible for assessing the company
'
s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or have
no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements
as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an
auditor's
report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with
ISAs (UK)
will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these
financial statements
.
The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below
.
The auditor’s explanation of its audit response will depend on the risks identified but may include:
- Enquiry of management, those charged with governance and the entity’s solicitors (or in-house legal team) around actual and potential litigation and claims.
- Enquiry of entity staff in tax and compliance functions to identify any instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations.
- Reviewing minutes of meetings of those charged with governance.
- Reviewing internal audit reports.
- Reviewing financial statement disclosures and testing to supporting documentation to assess compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
- Auditing the risk of management override of controls, including through testing journal entries and other adjustments for appropriateness, and evaluating the business rationale of significant transactions outside the normal course of business.
A further description of our responsibilities is available on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at: https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor's report.
Use of our report
This report is made solely to the company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company's members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the company’s accounting policies, the directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised where the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods where the revision affects both current and future periods.

Accounting policies
(Continued)
- 13 -
2.3
Turnover
Turnover is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for services provided in the normal course of business
, and
is shown net of VAT and other sales related taxes
.
The fair value of consideration takes into account trade discounts, settlement discounts and volume rebates.
When cash inflows are deferred and represent a financing arrangement, the fair value of the consideration is the present value of the future receipts. The difference between the fair value of the consideration and the nominal amount received is recognised as interest income.
The total turnover recorded in respect of long term contracts in the profit and loss of all accounting periods since the inception of the contract is compared with total payments on account. If the turnover exceeds payments on account an “ amounts recoverable on contracts “ is established and separately disclosed within debtors . If payments on account are greater than turnover to date , the excess is classified as a deduction from any balance on that contract, with the residual balance in excess of costs being classified within creditors.
Where the outcome of a long term can be estimated reliably, revenue and costs are recognized by reference to the stage of completion. This is measured by the proportion that contract costs incurred to date bear to the estimated contract costs.
Where the outcome cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised only to the extent of the expenses recognised that
it is probable will be
recover
ed
.Contract costs are recognized as expenses in the period in which they are incurred.
When it is probable that the total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
2.4
Research and development expenditure
Research expenditure is written off against profits in the year in which it is incurred. Identifiable development expenditure is capitalised to the extent that the technical, commercial and financial feasibility can be demonstrated
.
2.5
Intangible fixed assets other than goodwill
Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are recognised at cost and are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over their useful lives on the following bases:
Development costs
Straight line over 10 years
2.6
Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets
are initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost or valuation, net of depreciation and any impairment losses.
Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over their useful lives on the following bases:
Leasehold improvements
10% on cost
Plant and equipment
20% on cost
Fixtures and fittings
10% on cost
Computers
20% to 33% on cost

Accounting policies
(Continued)
- 14 -
The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying value of the asset, and
is credited or charged to profit or loss
.
2.7
Impairment of fixed assets
At each reporting
period
end date, the
company
reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible
and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the
company
estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in
profit
or
loss
, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Recognised impairment losses are reversed if, and only if, the reasons for the impairment loss have ceased to apply. Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit)
in
prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in
profit
or
loss
, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
2.8
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents
are basic financial assets
and
include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities.
2.9
Financial instruments
The company has elected to apply the provisions of Section 11 ‘Basic Financial Instruments’ and Section 12 ‘Other Financial Instruments Issues’ of FRS 102 to all of its financial instruments.
Financial instruments are recognised in the company's balance sheet when the company becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset
, with
the net amounts presented in the financial statements
,
when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Basic financial assets
Basic financial assets, which include
debtors
and cash and bank balances, are initially measured at transaction price including transaction costs and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest
method unless the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where the transaction is measured at the present value of the future receipts discounted at a market rate of interest.
Financial assets classified as receivable within one year are not amortised.

- 15 -
Other financial assets
Other financial assets, including investments in equity instruments which are not subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures, are initially measured at fair value, which is normally the transaction price. Such assets are subsequently carried at fair value and the changes in fair value are recognised in
profit
or
loss
, except that investments in equity instruments that are not publicly traded and whose fair values cannot be measured reliably are measured at cost less impairment.
Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets, other than those
held
at
fair value through profit and loss
, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each reporting end date.
Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows have been affected.
If an asset is impaired, the impairment loss is the difference between the carrying amount and the present value of the estimated cash flows discounted at the asset’s original effective interest rate. The impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss.
If there is a decrease in the impairment loss arising from an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the impairment is reversed. The reversal is such that the current carrying amount does not exceed what the carrying amount would have been, had the impairment not previously been recognised. The impairment reversal is recognised in profit or loss.
Derecognition of financial assets
Financial assets are derecognised only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or are settled, or when
the company
transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to another entity, or if some significant risks and rewards of ownership are retained but control of the asset has transferred to another party that is able to sell the asset in its entirety to an unrelated third party.
Classification of financial liabilities
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the company after deducting all of its liabilities.
Basic financial liabilities
Basic financial liabilities, including
creditors
, bank loans, loans from
fellow group companies and preference shares that are classified as debt, are
initially recognised at transaction price unless the arrangement constitutes a
financing transaction, where the debt instrument is measured at the present value of
the future
paymen
ts discounted at a market rate of interest.
Financial liabilities classified as payable within one year are not amortised.
Debt instruments are subsequently carried at amortised cost, using the effective
interest rate method.
Trade creditors
are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired
in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. A
m
ounts payable are classified as
current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less. If not, they are presented
as non-current liabilities.
Trade creditors
are recognised initially at transaction price
and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Derecognition of financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the company’s contractual obligations
expire or are discharged or cancelled.

Accounting policies
(Continued)
- 16 -
2.10
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of transaction costs. Dividends payable on equity instruments are recognised as liabilities once they are no longer at the discretion of the company.
2.11
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Current tax
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the
profit and loss account
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The
company’s
liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting end date.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all timing differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the timing difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting end date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the
profit and loss account
, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the
company
has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority.
2.12
Employee benefits
The costs of short-term employee benefits are recognised as a liability and an expense, unless those costs are required to be recognised as part of the cost of stock or
fixed assets
.
The cost of any unused holiday entitlement is recognised in the period in which the employee’s services are received.
Termination benefits are recognised immediately as an expense when the company is demonstrably committed to terminate the employment of an employee or to provide termination benefits.
2.13
Retirement benefits
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
2.14
Leases
Rentals payable under operating leases,
including
any lease incentives received, are charged to
profit or loss
on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease except where another more systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the lease
s
asset are consumed.

Financial commitments, guarantees and contingent liabilities
There was a cross corporate guarantee in place for
certain
UK group companies
(including Contractair Limited)
at 31 December 2022. Credit Suisse (Switzerland)
AG
had a fixed charge over the receivables of the company which was created on 2 August 2017.
T
he Credit Suisse charges have been satisfied/removed on 4
April 2
023.
These were replaced with the ability to pledge shares for LRTT
Limited
to finance providers. LRTT
Limited's
shares
were p
ledged to UBS Group AG
in the event of default on the Group facilities.
Separately,
LRTT Limited has received a claim from HMRC for repayment of the Research & Development (R&D) tax relief it received for the accounting year 2021 and 2022. HMRC reject the R&D (SME scheme) claims on the basis of insufficient evidence that the R&D activity undertaken in these years does not qualify for tax purposes under BEIS Guideline 2004.
HMRC will not be pursuing any penalties but requested repayment of the R&D tax relief of £160,81
3
(2021) and £198,77
4
(2022).
Management will be pursuing these claims as being eligible for R&D tax relief and valid within the scope of the BEIS Guidelines 2004, under the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) process with HMRC. LRTT Limited h
as
requested that the repayments are suspended pending the outcome of LRTT Limited’s appeal and any future ADR process. Therefore, as Management recognise that a repayment may be possible if their request for suspension and ultimately an appeal is unsuccessful,
we
do not believe this to be the probable outcome at the date these accounts were signed and consequently no provision for repayments and interest charges has been made.
