PUBLIC RELATIONS COMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION LIMITED

CHAIR'S STATEMENT
FOR THE PERIOD ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023

For the PRCA the calendar year of 2023 was one of challenge, consolidation and change. The financial results of
the shortened year (as the organisation moved from financial to calendar year reporting) reflect that.

The untimely death of the association's long-standing Director General, Francis Ingham, clearly brought deep
challenges. Thanks to the efforts of the PRCA executives and many senior members across a range of Boards and
Committees, the organisation was able to continue to deliver the full range of activities expected from the world's
leading trade association for the public relations industry.

Those activities included significant work to consolidate foundations for long term success. A wide-ranging
governance review has introduced a structure and processes that bring new levels of professionalism and oversight
to the organisation.

In September, the first new Management Board under that structure was elected at the AGM. Its members reflect
the breadth and diversity of our vibrant industry, in the UK and internationally. For the first time, we now also have
two independent directors who provide additional oversight to our efforts. | thank all of those Board Directors for
their commitment and contributions.

The second major change in leadership was in the executive team. There was huge interest in the new position of
Chief Executive, with applicants from across and beyond the industry, and we were delighted to confirm the
appointment of James Hewes in October. He took up his role in January 2024. Under his management, and the
guidance of the Management Board, | expect the PRCA to report significantly improved financial results for 2024.

In the shortened 2023 financial year, the issues above affected profitability in three ways. While membership
remained largely constant, there was a small drop in gross profits as event and other income slowed. The short
year’s phasing of income and costs meant a drop in profits which will not be reflected in 2024. And there were
significant exceptional costs during the year.

As | write this, the financial performance for the first months of 2024 shows the PRCA has taken the necessary
action to build long-term financial stability and get back to focusing on what's important: delivering value to
members, showcasing the best work those members deliver and being a voice for the public relations industry in the
UK and across the globe.

Whatever the performance, this Management Board is committed to transparency, and from this year the full P&L
will be published at Companies House, as well as being made available to members. We recognise we are
stewards of members’ dues; they deserve to know how that money is managed and be sure the PRCA is delivering
value.

| would like to put on record my heartfelt thanks to the staff of the PRCA for their efforts during a challenging year; to
the members of the Board who served until September 2023 — many of them for years — and to the new members of
the Management Board since then; and to Sarah Scholefield, the past Chair and now President, and Charles
Lewington, Vice President, for their efforts during the year. Most of all, on behalf of all Board members, | thank the
thousands of members — in agencies, in in-house teams and sole practitioners - who make up this vibrant industry,
and who make this association such a key part of that industry.

Ray Eglington
Chair

DIRECTORS' RESPONSIBILITIES STATEMENT
FOR THE PERIOD ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023

The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the financial statements in accordance with
applicable law and regulations.

Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the
directors have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company law the directors
must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of
affairs of the company and of the surplus or deficit of the company for that period. In preparing these financial
statements, the directors are required to:

+ select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;

« make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;

« prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the
company will continue in business.

The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the
company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company
and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.


PUBLIC RELATIONS COMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION LIMITED

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT

TO THE MEMBERS OF PUBLIC RELATIONS COMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION
LIMITED

Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of Public Relations Communications Association Limited (the ‘company’)
for the Period ended 31 December 2023 which comprise the income and expenditure account, the balance sheet,
the statement of changes in equity and notes to the financial statements, including significant accounting policies.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom
Accounting Standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 102 The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in
the UK and Republic of treland (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

In our opinion the financial statements:
+ give a true and fair view of the state of the company's affairs as at 31 December 2023 and of its deficit for the
Period then ended;
« have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
« have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable
law, Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of
the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the company in accordance with the ethical
requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical
Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe
that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Conclusions relating to going concern
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of
accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or
conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going
concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the
relevant sections of this report.

Other information

The other information comprises the information included in the annual report other than the financial statements
and our auditor's report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual
report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent
otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. Our
responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially
inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears
to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are
required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If,
based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information,
we are required to report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of our audit:
+ the information given in the directors’ report for the financial Period for which the financial statements are
prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
« the directors’ report has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.


PUBLIC RELATIONS COMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION LIMITED

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT (CONTINUED)

TO THE MEMBERS OF PUBLIC RELATIONS COMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION
LIMITED

Matters on which we are required to report by exception

In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the course of the
audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the directors’ report. We have nothing to report in respect of
the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:

+ adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received
from branches not visited by us; or

the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or

certain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or

we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or

the directors were not entitled to prepare the financial statements in accordance with the small companies
fegime and take advantage of the small companies' exemption in preparing the directors' report and from the
requirement to prepare a strategic report.

Responsibilities of directors

As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as
the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for
assessing the company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the company
or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance
with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or
error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

A further description of our responsibilities is available on the Financial Reporting Council's website at: https://
www. frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor's report.


PUBLIC RELATIONS COMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION LIMITED

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT (CONTINUED)

TO THE MEMBERS OF PUBLIC RELATIONS COMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION
LIMITED

Extent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in
line with our responsibilities, outlined above and on the Financial Reporting Council's website, to detect material
misstatements in respect of irregularities; including fraud.

We obtain and update our understanding of the entity, its activities, its control environment, and likely future
developments, including in relation to the legal and regulatory framework applicable and how the entity is complying
with that framework. Based on this understanding, we identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the
financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks,
and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. This includes
consideration of the risk of acts by the entity that were contrary to applicable laws and regulations, including fraud.

In response to the risk of irregularities and non-compliance with laws and regulations, including fraud, we designed
procedures which included:

+ Enquiry of management and those charged with governance around actual and potential litigation and
claims as well as actual, suspected and alleged fraud;

Reviewing minutes of meetings of those charged with governance;

Assessing the extent of compliance with the laws and regulations considered to have a direct material
effect on the financial statements or the operations of the company through enquiry and inspection;
Reviewing financial statement disclosures and testing to supporting documentation to assess compliance
with applicable laws and regulations;

Performing audit work over the risk of management bias and override of controls, including testing of
journal entries and other adjustments for appropriateness, evaluating the business rationale of significant
transactions outside the normal course of business and reviewing accounting estimates for indicators of
potential bias.

Because of the inherent limitations of an audit, there is a risk that we will not detect all irregularities, including those
leading to a material misstatement in the financial statements or non-compliance with regulation. This risk
increases the more that compliance with a law or regulation is removed from the events and transactions reflected
in the financial statements, as we will be less likely to become aware of instances of non-compliance. The risk of
not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may
involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

Use of our report

This report is made solely to the company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company's members those
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company's
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

00965517, and consequently does not have share capital. Each of the members is liable to contribute an
amount not exceeding £1 towards the assets of the company in the event of liquidation.

Accounting convention

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 102 “The Financial Reporting
Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland” (“FRS 102”) and the requirements of the Companies
Act 2006 as applicable to companies subject to the small companies regime. The disclosure requirements of
section 1A of FRS 102 have been applied other than where additional disclosure is required to show a true
and fair view.

The financial statements are prepared in sterling, which is the functional currency of the company. Monetary
amounts in these financial statements are rounded to the nearest £.

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention. The principal accounting
policies adopted are set out below.

prepare consolidated accounts, on the basis that the group of which this is the parent qualifies as a small
group. The financial statements present information about the company as an individual entity and not about
its group.

Going concern

company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus the
directors continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.

Reporting period

During the period, the company brought forward its year end from 31 March 2024 to 31 December 2023. The
comparative amounts presented in the financial statements (included the related notes) are not entirely
comparable. .

Turnover

provided in the normal course of business, and is shown net of VAT and other sales related taxes. The fair
value of consideration takes into account trade discounts, settlement discounts and volume rebates.

When cash inflows are deferred and represent a financing arrangement, the fair value of the consideration is
the present value of the future receipts. The difference between the fair value of the consideration and the
nominal amount received is recognised as interest income.

Intangible fixed assets

amortisation.

installation.

Accounting policies (Continued)

Tangible assets are stated in the statement of financial position at cost, less any subsequent accumulated
depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses.

The cost of tangible assets includes directly attributable incremental costs incurred in their acquisition and
installation.

over their estimated useful lives, as follows:

Furniture, fittings and equipment 25% straight line

Fixed asset investments

Interests in subsidiaries, associates and jointly controlled entities are initially measured at cost and
subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. The investments are assessed for
impairment at each reporting date and any impairment losses or reversals of impairment losses are
recognised immediately in surplus or deficit.

change in value.

Basic financial assets

impairment of trade debtors is established when there is objective evidence that the company will not be able
to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.

Basic financial liabilities

Trade creditors are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of
business from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if the company does not have an

substantively enacted by the reporting date in the countries where the company operates and generates
taxable income.

Retirement benefits

A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which fixed contributions are paid into a pension fund and

sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior
periods.

contribution payments exceed the contribution due for service, the excess is recognised as a prepayment.

Foreign exchange

Transactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing at the
dates of the transactions. At each reporting end date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in
foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the reporting end date. Gains and losses arising
on translation in the period are included in profit or loss.

Share Capital

of the members if liable to contribute an amount not exceeding £1 towards the assets of the company in the
event of liquidation.

Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty

appropriate. The actual lives of the assets and residual values are assessed annually and may vary
depending on a number of factors. In re-assessing asset lives, factors such as technological innovation,
product life cycles and maintenance progreammes are taken into account. Residual value assessments
consider issues such as future market conditions, the remaining life of the asset and Projected disposal
values.

Bad debt provision is provided for on trade debts where it is considered the amount is unrecoverable after
extensive recoverability efforts have been made .
