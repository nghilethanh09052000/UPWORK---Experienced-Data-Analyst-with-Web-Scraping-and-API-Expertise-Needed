STRATEGIC REPORT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2024

Introduction

The directors have pleasure in presenting their report and the financial statements of the company for the year
ended 31 March 2024.

Business review

The principal activity of the company is the manufacture and fabrication of sheet metal products.

The registered office is Caledonian Exchange, 19a Canning Street, Edinburgh, EH3 8HE.

The directors aim to present a balanced and comprehensive review of the development and performance of the
business during the year and its position at the year end. The review is consistent with the size and non-complex
nature of the business and is written in the context of the risks and uncertainties faced.

Principal risks and uncertainties

The market conditions in which the company operates are still extremely challenging due to the global economic
climate and the competitive pressures within the industry.

Financial Risk

The company's operations expose it to a variety of financial risks that include the effect of changes in credit,
liquidity and interest rate risk. The company has in place a risk management programme that seeks to limit the
adverse effects on the financial performance of the company by monitoring levels of debt finance and the related -
finance costs. The company does not use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate costs and as
such no hedge accounting is applied.

Credit Risk

The company has implemented policies that require appropriate credit checks on customers before sales are
made. In addition to this the company insures the recoverability of all commercial sales through an outside credit
agency.

Liquidity Risk

The directors believe that the company has sufficient funds available to support its activities in the future.

STRATEGIC REPORT (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2024

Financial key performance indicators

The key financial performance indicators are those that communicate the financial performance and strength of
the company as a whole. These being turnover, gross margin and return on capital employed.

‘Turnover has decreased very slightly from £33,824,791 in 2023 to £33,379,909 in 2024. The decrease in sales
revenue was in line with expectations. In addition to this the product mix is constantly changing, depending on
the order base, and new products are constantly being developed.

The gross profit percentage has decreased marginally from 28.8% in 2023 to 28.0% in 2024.

Return on capital employed is approximately 8% (2023 - 16%) and is calculated by operating profit divided by
total assets less current liabilities.

The directors have been seeking to maintain margin, contain operating costs, increase the number of customers,
and improve product quality. To achieve these business targets, KMF continues to invest in new machinery and
production processes in order to enhance the quality and delivery of customers products and control costs.
Additions to fixed assets amount to £1,089,401. .

The directors and management team are committed to a culture of continuous improvement and recognise that
continued investment in facilities, equipment, technology and people are crucial to enable the company to
continue to deliver the exceptional level of service that it is renowned for. .

It has always been the company’s strategy to retain the skills within the business whilst developing the skills of its
apprentices; this is a key strength of the business. KMF will continue to invest in apprentices to ensure the
future of the business.

As part of the company's continued growth strategy, the group has continued to invest in its overseas
manufacturing facility, and utilised the skills of the UK Company. The directors are confident that the overseas
operation will deliver consistent profits during the course of 2024, as the benefit of operational leverage will
continue.

Executive board meetings are held monthly, with full board meetings held three times a year. Actual performance
is compared to budget at these meetings and significant variances are investigated. The management of
working capital is also reviewed at these meetings.

With the risks and uncertainties of the current economic climate, the directors are aware that any plans for the
future development of the business may be subject to unforeseen future events outside of their control.

Shareholders funds as at 31 March 2024 amounted to £13,485,806.

Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice), including Financial Reporting

law the directors must not approve the financial statements ‘unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair
view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period.

In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:

e select suitable accounting policies for the Company's financial statements and then apply them
consistently;

° make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;

e state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures
disclosed and explained in the financial statements;

. prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the

Company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain
the Company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the
Company and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They
are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

and views on the company's performance. Regular meetings are held between local management and
employees to allow a free flow of information and ideas.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF KMF PRECISION SHEET METAL LIMITED

Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of KMF Precision Sheet Metal Limited (the 'Company’) for the year
ended 31 March 2024, which comprise the Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Statement of Financial
Position, the Statement of Changes in Equity and the related notes, including a summary of significant
accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law
and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 102 ‘The Financial Reporting
Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland’ (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice).

In our opinion the financial statements:

e give a true and fair view of the state of the Company's affairs as at 31 March 2024 and of its profit for the
year then ended; .

e have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accountin:
Practice; and .

° have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable
law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit
of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the
ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the United Kingdom, including
the Financial Reporting Council's Ethical Standard and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in
accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Conclusions relating to going concern

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of
accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or
conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a
going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the
relevant sections of this report.

Other information

The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report other than the financial
statements and our Auditors’ Report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained
within the Annual Report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and,
except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion
thereon. Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other
information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the
audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent
material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the
financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material
misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF KMF PRECISION SHEET. METAL LIMITED
(CONTINUED)

Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

e the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and

e the Strategic Report and the Directors' Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal
requirements.

Matters on which we are required to report by exception

In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Company and its environment obtained in the course of
the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic Report or the Directors' Report.

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006
requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:

. ‘adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been
received from branches not visited by us; or

. the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or

. certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or

° we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

Responsibilities of directors

As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 4, the directors are
responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair
view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Company's ability to
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going
concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Company or to cease operations,
or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF KMF PRECISION SHEET METAL LIMITED
(CONTINUED)

Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an Auditors' Report that includes our
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures
in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities,
including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is
detailed below:

Our approach to identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including
fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations, was as follows:

* the engagement partner ensured that the engagement team collectively had the appropriate competence,
capabilities and skills to identify or recognise non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations;

* we identified the laws and regulations applicable to the company through discussions with directors and other
management and review of appropriate industry knowledge; :

* we assessed the extent of compliance with the laws and regulations identified above through making enquiries
of management; and .

* identified laws and regulations were communicated within the audit team regularly and the team remained alert
to instances of non-compliance throughout the audit.

We assessed the susceptibility of the Company's financial statements to material misstatement, including
obtaining an understanding of how fraud might occur, by:

* making enquiries of management as to where they considered there was susceptibility to fraud, their
knowledge of actual, suspected and alleged fraud; and

* considering the internal controls in place to mitigate risks of fraud and non-compliance with laws and
regulations.

To address the risk of fraud through management bias and override of controls, we:
* performed analytical procedures as a risk assessment tool to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships;

* tested journal entries to identify unusual transactions; and tested the operating effectiveness of key controls
over purchase cycles on a sample basis.

* reviewed the application of accounting policies with focus on those with heightened estimation uncertainty.

In response to the risk of irregularities and non-compliance with laws and regulations, we designed procedures
which included, but were not limited to:

* agreeing financial statement disclosures to underlying supporting documentation; and

* enquiring of management as to actual and potential litigation and claims.

Page 8

KMF PRECISION SHEET METAL LIMITED

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF KMF PRECISION SHEET METAL LIMITED
(CONTINUED)

Due to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk that we may not have detected some
material misstatements in the financial statements, even though we have properly planned and performed our
audit in accordance with auditing standards. For example, as with any audit, there remained a higher risk of
nondetection of irregularities, as these may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations,
or the override of internal controls. We are not responsible for preventing fraud or non-compliance with laws and
regulations and cannot be expected to detect all fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial
Reporting Council's website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our
Auditors’ Report.

Use of our report

This report is made solely to the Company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company's members
those matters we are required to state to them in an Auditors’ Report and for no other purpose. To the fullest
extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the
Company's members, as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

2.5

Revenue

Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the
Company and the revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is measured as the fair value of the
consideration received or receivable, excluding discounts, rebates, value added tax and other sales
taxes. The following criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised:

Sale of goods

Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when all of the following conditions are satisfied:

° the Company has transferred the significant risks and rewards of ownership to the buyer;

° the Company retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually
associated with ownership nor effective control over the goods sold;

. the amount of revenue can be measured reliably;

° it is probable that the Company will receive the consideration due under the transaction; and

e the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.

Tangible fixed assets

Tangible fixed assets under the cost model are stated at historical cost less accumulated
depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Historical cost includes expenditure that is
directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of

operating in the manner intended by management. :

At each reporting date the Company assesses whether there is any indication of impairment. If such
indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is determined which is the higher of its fair
value less costs to sell and its value in use. An impairment loss is recognised where the carrying
amount exceeds the recoverable amount.

The Company adds to the carrying amount of an item of fixed assets the cost of replacing part of
such an item when that cost is incurred, if the replacement part is expected to provide incremental
future benefits to the Company. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. Repairs
and maintenance are charged to profit or loss during the period in which they are incurred.

Depreciation is charged so as to allocate the cost of assets less their residual value over their
estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method.

Depreciation is provided on the following basis:

Plant and machinery - between 12.5% & 50% on cost
Motor vehicles - 25% on cost

The assets’ residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted
prospectively if appropriate, or if there is an indication of a significant change since the last reporting
date.

Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount
and are recognised in profit or loss.

2.9

Stocks

Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value, being the estimated selling price less
costs to complete and sell. Cost is based on the cost of purchase on a weighted average basis. Work
in progress and finished goods include labour and attributable overheads.

At each reporting date, stocks are assessed for impairment. If stock is impaired, the carrying amount
is reduced to its selling price less costs to complete and sell. The impairment loss is recognised
immediately in profit or loss.

Debtors

Short-term debtors are measured at transaction price, less any impairment. Loans receivable are
measured initially at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are measured subsequently at amortised
cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment.

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash is represented by cash in hand and deposits with financial institutions repayable without penalty
on notice of not more than 24 hours. Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments that mature in no
more than three months from the date of acquisition and that are readily convertible to known
amounts of cash with insignificant risk of change in value.

Creditors
Short-term creditors are measured at the transaction price. Other financial liabilities, including bank

loans, are measured initially at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are measured subsequently at
amortised cost using the effective interest method.

2.10 Foreign currency translation

Functional and presentation currency

The Company's functional and presentational currency is GBP.

Transactions and balances

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the Spot exchange
rates at the dates of the transactions.

At each period end foreign currency monetary items are translated using the closing rate. Non-
monetary items measured at historical cost are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the
transaction and non-monetary items measured at fair value are measured using the exchange rate
when fair value was determined.

Accounting policies (continued)

2.11 Financial instruments

The Company has elected to apply the provisions of Section 11 “Basic Financial Instruments” of FRS
102 to all of its financial instruments.

Financial instruments are recognised in the Company's Statement of Financial Position when the
Company becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

Financial assets and liabilities are offset, with the net amounts presented in the financial statements,
when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to
settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Basic financial assets

Basic financial assets, which include trade and other receivables, cash and bank balances, are
initially measured at their transaction price including transaction costs and are subsequently carried
at their amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any provision for impairment, unless
the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where the transaction is measured at the
present value of the future receipts discounted at a market rate of interest.

Discounting is omitted where the effect of discounting is immaterial. The Company's cash and cash
equivalents, trade and most other receivables due with the operating cycle fall into this category of
financial instruments.

Financial liabilities

Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual
arrangements entered into. An equity instruments any contract that evidences a residual interest in
the assets of the Company after the deduction of all its liabilities.

Basic financial liabilities, which include trade and other payables, bank loans and other loans are
initially measured at their transaction price after transaction costs. When this constitutes a financing
transaction, whereby the debt instrument is measured at the present value of the future payments
discounted at a market rate of interest. Discounting is omitted where the effect of discounting is
immaterial.

Debt instruments are subsequently carried ‘at their amortised cost using the effective interest rate
method.

Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods and services that have been acquired in the ordinary
course of business from suppliers. Trade payables are classified as current liabilities if the payment is
due within one year. If not, they represent non-current liabilities. Trade payables are. initially
recognised at their transaction price and subsequently are measured at amortised cost using the
effective interest method. Discounting is omitted where the effect of discounting is immaterial.

2.12 Government grants

Grants are accounted under the accruals model as permitted by FRS 102. Grants relating to
expenditure on tangible fixed assets are credited to profit or loss at the same rate as the depreciation
on the assets to which the grant relates. The deferred element of grants is included in creditors as
deferred income.

Grants of a revenue nature are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the same
period as the related expenditure.

Accounting policies (continued)

2.13 Finance costs

Finance costs are charged to profit or loss over the term of the debt using the effective interest
method so that the amount charged is at a constant rate on the carrying amount. Issue costs are
initially recognised as a reduction in the proceeds of the associated capital instrument.

2.14 Operating leases: the Company as lessee

Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the
lease term.

Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to sign an operating lease are recognised on a
straight-line basis over the lease term, unless another systematic basis is representative of the time
pattern of the lessee's benefit from the use of the leased asset.

2.15 Leased assets: the Company as lessee

Assets obtained under hire purchase contracts and finance leases are capitalised as tangible fixed
assets. Assets acquired by finance lease are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their
useful lives. Assets acquired by hire purchase are depreciated over their useful lives. Finance leases
are those where substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership are assumed by the company.
Obligations under such agreements are included in creditors net of the finance charge allocated to
future periods. The finance element of the rental payment is charged to profit or loss so as to produce
a constant periodic rate of charge on the net obligation outstanding in each period.

2.16 Pensions

Defined contribution pension plan
The Company operates a defined contribution plan for its employees. A defined contribution plan is a

. pension plan under which the Company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. Once the
contributions have been paid the Company has no further payment obligations.
The contributions are recognised as an expense in profit or loss when they fall due. Amounts not paid
are shown in accruals as a liability in the Statement of Financial Position. The assets of the plan are
held separately from the Company in independently administered funds.

2.17 Interest income

Interest income is recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method.

Accounting policies (continued)

2.18 Current and deferred taxation

The tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in profit or loss
except that a charge attributable to an item of income and expense recognised as other
comprehensive income or to an item recognised directly in equity is also recognised in other
comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.

The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of tax rates and laws that have been
enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date in the countries where the Company operates
and generates income.

Deferred tax balances are recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not

reversed by the reporting date, except that:

. The recognition of deferred tax assets is limited to the extent that it is probable that they will be
recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits; and

e Any deferred tax balances are reversed if and when all conditions for retaining associated tax
allowances have been met.

Deferred tax balances are not recognised in respect of permanent differences except in respect of
business combinations, when deferred tax is recognised on the differences between the fair values of
assets acquired and the future tax deductions available for them and the differences between the fair
values of liabilities acquired and the amount that will be assessed for tax. Deferred tax is determined
using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.

Judgements in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty

The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income
and expenses.

Judgements and estimates are continually evaluated and are based on historical experiences and other
factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the

circumstances.

The company makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting
estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results.

The directors consider the key accounting estimates to be provision for trade debtors, useful life and
residual value of tangible fixed assets, and provision for obsolete stock.

Provisions for trade debtors are reviewed by the directors on an ongoing basis who use their specific
industry knowledge and experience to ensure the correct judgements.

The useful lives and residual values of tangible fixed assets are reviewed on an ongoing basis by the
directors.

Provisions for obsolete stock are reviewed by the directors on an ongoing basis who use their specific
industry knowledge and experience to ensure the correct judgements.
