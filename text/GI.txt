Strategic report

Introduction

This Strategic Report has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Section 414 of the -
Companies Act 2006. Its purpose is to inform shareholders and help them to assess how the Directors
have performed their duty to promote the success of Gi Group Recruitment Limited ("the Company”).

Principal activities

The principal activity of Gi Group Recruitment Limited (the company”) is that of a services provider
supplying temporary labour, and an employment agency providing permanent staff.

Business model

The company, as part of Gi Group (“the group”) provides services to its clients through two principal
delivery channels:

1. Anationwide network of (predominantly) high street based branches supplying temporary and
permanent staff to a combination of local businesses and larger corporate clients.

2. Its SMS (Site Managed Services) division within which large numbers of temporary workers are
supplied and managed through teams of Gi Group people situated permanently on the client's
own premises. This model mainly serves the needs of larger, corporate clients with significant
year round requirements for temporary labour.

Value is added to the basic recruitment services provided in a range of ways, dependent on the
requirements of the client. Typically these might include the provision of management information, HR
consultancy services, shift planning, skills training and provision of apprenticeships.

Business review and results

The company services a diverse portfolio of clients that are intrinsic industries to the UK daily life such
as food production, warehousing, logistics and pharmaceutical production. As a result the company
has been historically aligned to the wider economic climate of the UK, even down to the seasonality in
the tead up to the UK holiday periods. The UK economy remained flat with respect to GDP growth and
has experiencing challenging double-digit inflation not seen for a generation. As a consequence, the
company has had a challenging trading year delivering an operating profit before depreciation of
£514,457 (2022: £1,365,622), resulting in an operating profit of £192,369 (2022: £1, 164,695).

Due to the way we finance the ongoing business we are exposed to interest rate increases. Post the
year end we have refinanced the business. This is a £30m trading facility with Citibank for the group
that is backed by our debt book, alongside a factoring agreement with MBFACTA to provide additional
funding for peak periods.

_ Our ultimate controlling party in Italy continue to be profitable and are committed to support the business.
During the year Gi Group Holding S.p.A. transferred £30m of intercompany loans into equity across the
group. As a result the company has been in a position to recapitalise with an equity injection of £2.5m
from the company's immediate parent Gi Recruitment Limited. The company’s net asset position at the
end of the year was £5,872,262 (2022: £4, 290,984).

FY24 still looks challenging for the company with the UK tentatively emerging from recession in Q1.
Whilst price stability is returning, there is no sureness on when the Bank of England will begin to
materially reduce interest rates. Prospective clients are holding off key decisions and investments until
there is more confidence in these areas but we are confident in being able to continue working with our
key clients during this period though. We retain our benefit of the holding of long-term clients with a
continued reputation as an established, legally compliant, ethical and reliable supplier of temporary
labour. In an increasingly regulated environment this is critical to our success.

Strategic report (continued)

Continuing progress is being made in the development of our front and back-office systems. We are
undergoing the implementation of a new pay and charge system which is the most important back-office
upgrade that the company has undergone for over a decade. It is expected to be live by Q3 in FY24.
This is an opportunity to bring together all the brands that operate in the group under a single system
and we expect this to crystalise material savings in our payroll and administration hubs.

During Q1 2024 Gi Group Holdings S.p.A. concluded an agreement to purchase Kelly Services
European business. The group has benefited from this with the UK and Ireland business of Kelly
Services yielding opportunities that are additive to Gross Profit and we are identifying synergy savings
in order to maximise this.

Key performance indicators

The company continues to operate a number of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), both financial and
non-financial.

The primary financial KPis and ratios monitored for internal management reporting are Turnover,
adjusted EBITDA (excluding Group management recharges from Gi Group Holding S.p.A. of £13,471
(2022: £356,922), Debtor Days and Gross Profit %. The results of these KPls for the year and prior
year are in the table below.

2023 2022
Turnover (£000) 123,365 163,792
Adjusted EBITDA (£’000) (268) 211
Average Debtor Days during the year . 76.0 50.2
Gross Profit Percentage 10.1% 8.7%

. Non-financial KPIs include the measures used in managing a sales focused organisation, including
activity levels, sales conversion ratios, sales volumes and values and client retention statistics, in
addition to employee related KPls such as attrition rates and FTE headcount.

Section 172 (1) Statement

In accordance with section 172 of the Companies Act 2006, the Board have the views of the key
stakeholders of the business in mind and have considered the below matters during Board discussion
and in their decision making.

The matters as set out in section 172(1) (a) to (f) are:

a) the likely consequences of any decision in the long term;

b) the interests of the company’s employees;

c) the need to foster the company’s business relationships with suppliers, customers and others;

d) the impact of the company’s operations on the community and the environment;

e) the desirability of the company maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct;
and

f) the need to act fairly between members of the company.

Strategic report (continued)

The key stakeholders identified include but are not limited to, our clients, our colleagues, our candidates,
and the wider community and environment, each of whom are considered in any decisions we make.
This is in addition to our shareholders and ultimate beneficial owners within the group.

The Board delegates authority for day-to-day management of the business to the Executive
Management Team (EMT”) for setting, approving and overseeing the execution of the business
strategy and related policies. The EMT hold monthly meetings at which all business matters are
discussed including business performance, risk management, any client issues or updates, health and
safety updates, and employee matters. The construction of the EMT represents all areas of the
operational business and support functions with a wealth of experience in the business brought to the
table. The experience of the EMT including their drive and passion will ensure that decisions made are
fair and beneficial to the majority of stakeholders in the long term, and will result in the long-term success
of the business.

We have held working relationships with many of our clients on a long-term basis and work alongside
many of them on site alongside their own colleagues. The length of the relationships we have held with
many of these clients is testament to the good working relationship we have with them and how we
consider them as key stakeholders.

Contract renegotiations are always a balance between the needs for continued success of our business
alongside the provision of their workforce requirements for their continued success. As a result during
the year we stepped away from some long term contracts in order to pursue our strategic aim of higher
gross profit percentage.

Our business is founded on building relationships, both with clients where we look to be a key part of
their workforce supply chain and also with candidates where we look to be an employer of choice.

Significant efforts are made by the company in ensuring the wellbeing of our employees. We have an
employee survey that is run globally on a periodic basis and with regular ‘pulse surveys’ in between to
monitor progress in certain areas. The feedback from the surveys will drive the focus of global and
local management within the Group to focus on specific areas of wellbeing. The success of the business
is dependent on our employees and as such it is critical that any decisions that are made have our
employees front of mind.

The company is committed to preventing opportunities for modern slavery to occur both within its own
and its supply chain’s daily business activities. We are Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority
(GLAA) licenced and have a number of business activities in place to enable us to identify areas of risk
and ensure prevention of occurrences of modern slavery.

The company is committed to the adoption of environmentally responsible policies and practices
throughout its operation. Whilst accepting that as a business operating in the service sector without any
raw materials or any production operations, our impact on the environment is not as substantial as that
of a manufacturing organisation, we aim to encourage a positive impact through our activities via
consumers, employees, communities and stakeholders. Additional disclosure regarding our SECR
energy compliance can be obtained in the consolidated parent company financial statements, Gi Group
Holdings Recruitment Ltd.

Principal risks and uncertainties

Our business continues to benefit from strong long-term relationships with major clients, however the
market remains subject to competition. As part of a large international group, the company is well-
placed to add to its portfolio of such clients, though this of course is accompanied by the risks attendant
in any competitive, tender based business, subject to increasing attention by professional procurement
departments.

Gi Group Recruitment Limited
Registered number 01949160
31 December 2023

Strategic report (continued)

Compliance with all relevant regulations continues to be a high priority for the Board, and the company’s
reputation as an ethical, reliable and substantial entity continue to make it an attractive partner for major
and often international clients.

The company continues to operate a fully-fledged Corporate Social Responsibility programme. This is
seen by the Board as an increasingly important focus as our employees and clients place more
emphasis on this in choosing GI as an employer of choice and as a key supplier.

Future developments

The Board anticipates a tough trading period for 2024. The UK annual output GDP growth estimate in
2023 is 0.4% with OECD estimates of 0.7% for 2024. Year on year temporary hours are down with a
limited pipeline of new clients. There is an expectation that back off cost cutting and poor performing
branches closures will be required in order to get back to profitability.

Directors’ report
The directors present their report and the audited financial statements of the company for the year
ended 31 December 2023.

Results and dividends

The loss for the year after taxation was £918,722 (2022: loss of £858,844). During the year, the
directors have not paid any interim dividends or recommended payment of a final dividend (2022: Enil).

Going concern

As part of the going concern assessment, the Directors have considered the company’s principal risk
areas including current economic conditions that they consider material to the assessment of going
concern including completed cash flow forecasts for at least 12 months from now, considering severe
but plausible downsides too. They have also considered the facilities available to the company,
including its rolling invoice discounting facility and ongoing support from Gi Group Holding S.p.A. Having
completed this assessment, the Directors believe that preparing the financial statements on the going
concern basis is appropriate due to the continued financial support of Gi Group Holding S.p.A. The
Directors have received written confirmation that Gi Group Holding S.p.A intends to support the
company for at least one year from the date of signing of these financial statements.

Post balance sheet events

An indication of likely future developments in the business has been included in the Strategic report.

performance is encouraged with an employee bonus scheme.

Statement of engagement with suppliers, customers and others in a business
relationship with the company

The directors acknowledge the need to foster the company’s business relationships with suppliers,
customers and others with the effect to continue the working relationship with them.

Statement of Corporate governance arrangement - Wates Principles

In accordance with the Companies (Miscellaneous Reporting) Regulations 2018, the company has
applied the Wates Corporate Governance principles for Large Private Companies (the ‘Wates
Principles’) — published by the Financial Reporting Council - as an appropriate framework for disclosing
our corporate governance arrangements.

Principle one — Purpose and Leadership

The Company’s mission, aligned with that of the Group — “Through our services we want to contribute,
as a key player and on a global basis, to the evolution of the labour market and to emphasize the
personal and social value of work.”

The mission was the starting point for defining the 6 core values of the Group. The work of each
individual and each Company in Gi Group is based on a Set of values consistent with our approach to
the labour market and the society in which we operate. These are Work, Responsibility, Care,
Economic Efficiency, Continuous Learning & Innovation and Team Spirit.

The mission and the core values are at the heart of what we do and the Board works to ensure that
these are embedded throughout the Company. All employees receive induction training to raise
awareness, and they are visible on many presentations and webcasts that the Group CEO provides.

Feedback from employees is obtained in a number of ways including engagement surveys and exit
interviews to monitor the culture of the business.

Principle Two — Board Composition
The Board of the company is the Executive Management Team (“EMT”) who are responsible for the
running of all of the UK companies within Gi Group, of which the company is one.

The EMT consists of the CEO (Chair), the FD, the Managing Directors of the operational brands within
the UK Group and Heads of Support Functions. The members of the EMT have a wealth of experience
in the industry with relevant technical knowledge with which to ensure the continued success of the
Company while considering the views and interests of the stakeholders of the business. The size and
composition of the EMT is appropriate and proportionate to the size of the business. The EMT meet
formally on a monthly basis.

Principle Three — Director Responsibilities

Directors of the Company and members of the EMT are all aware of the policies and procedures by
which the business is run. All policies are reviewed by the EMT prior to publication and on a periodic
basis. The EMT will consider relevant policies wnen making decisions about the business. EMT
meetings are an open forum where individual opinions are sought, considered and challenged to ensure
that the decisions made are fair and in the best interests of stakeholders.

Directors’ report (continued)

Principle Four — Opportunity and Risk :

The EMT is at the forefront of the Company's efforts to continue to evolve it’s offering to clients, operate
in new areas, and seek out new business opportunities. They are responsible for the long term growth
and sustainability of the business and part of their reward is based thereon. Any new opportunities are
discussed with the EMT.

The risks of the business, both financial and non-financial are monitored by the EMT. There are two
primary formal risk frameworks in place with regular reporting cycles. A risk register is maintained and
updated on a quarterly basis which is reviewed by EMT and reported to Group each quarter. There is
also a review of key controls across the business on an annual basis. Overall risk management is also
overseen by the Group risk management procedures.

Principle Five - Remuneration

The remuneration of the EMT is overseen by the CEO of the Company, with the remunerations of the
CEO being reviewed by the Group in Italy. External market factors are balanced with overall profitability
of the business when considering remuneration to ensure the long-term sustainability of the business.

Principle Six — Stakeholder Relationships and Engagement

The EMT recognise the importance of stakeholder management and of building effective relationships
with our key stakeholders. For further details regarding the way in which the Company interacts with
Stakeholders, please refer to the Section 172 (1) Statement within the Strategic report on page 3.

Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting (SECR) disclosure

Our SECR disclosure can be found in the consolidated results of the parent company, Gi Group
Holdings Recruitment Limited. Included within the energy performance data within the Gi Group
Holdings Recruitment Limited annual report are all Gi Group entities in the UK, being all direct and
indirect subsidiaries of Gi Group Holdings Recruitment Limited.

Financial risk management

The company has established a risk and financial management framework whose primary objective is
to ensure sufficient working capital exists and to monitor the management of risk at a business unit
level. The company aims to mitigate credit and liquidity risk by managing cash generation by its
operations and applying cash collection targets. The company also manages liquidity via a group credit
facility and a factoring without recourse facility set up in 2024. We forecast prudent wage increases
below inflation in order to maintain control over operating expenditure. Cost increases with respect to
temporary worker wages are passed onto our clients. We forecast prudent wage increases below

Research and development

The company performed no research and development in the year (2022: £nil).

Political contributions

The company made no political donations or incurred any political expenditure during the year (2022:

Disclosure of information to auditors

The directors who held office at the date of approval of this Directors’ report confirm that, so far as they
are each aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the company’s auditors are unaware;

Gi Group Recruitment Limited
Registered number 01949160

Directors’ report (continued)

and each director has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a director to make himself
aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the company's auditors are aware of that
information.

Statement of directors’ responsibilities in respect of the financial statements

The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, Strategic Report, the Directors’ Report
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations and in accordance with
United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice.

Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that
law they have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice (FRS 102).

Under company law, directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that
they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of the profit or loss of the
company for that period. In preparing the financial statements, the directors are required to:

e select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; :

e make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and

* prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to
presume that the company will continue in business.

The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and
explain the company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial
position of the company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the
Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and hence
for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial
information included on the company's website. Legislation in the United Kingdom, governing the
preparation and dissemination of financial statements, may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Independent auditors

Pursuant to Section 487 of the Companies Act 2006 the auditors, A.C.T. Audit Limited, will be deemed
to be reappointed and therefore continue in office.

Independent auditors’ report to the members of Gi Group
Recruitment Limited

Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of Gi Group Recruitment Limited (the ‘company’) for the year
ended 31 December 2023 which comprise the Statement of Comprehensive Income, Balance Sheet,
Statement of Changes in Equity and Notes to the Financial Statements, including significant accounting
policies. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law
and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 102 The Financial Reporting Standard
applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

In our opinion the financial statements:
° give a true and fair view of the state of the company's affairs as at 31 December 2023 and of
__ its loss for the year then ended;
e have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice; and
e have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and
applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's
responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the
company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial
statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Conclusions Relating to Going Concern
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the director's use of the going concern
basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to
events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the company’s
ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from when the financial
statements are authorised for issue.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described
in the relevant sections of this report.

Other Information

The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the
information in the Strategic Report, the Directors’ Report and the Statement of Directors’
Responsibilities, but does not include the financial statements and our Report of the Auditors thereon.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent
otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the
financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be
materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements,
we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financiat
statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a
material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to
report in this regard.

Opinions on Other Matters Prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
¢ the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report for the financial year for
which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
¢ the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable
legal requirements.

Matters on Which We Are Required to Report by Exception

In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the
course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic report or Directors'
report.

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires
us to report to you if, in our opinion:
*® adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate
for our audit have riot been received from branches not visited by us; or
« the company’s financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and
returns; or
certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
the directors were not entitled to take advantage of the small companies’ exemption from the
requirement to prepare a Strategic Report or in preparing the Directors’ Report.

Responsibilities of Directors

As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 9, the directors are
responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true
and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the
preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or
error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the company's ability
to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using
the going concem basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the company or to
cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report
that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee
that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when
it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in
the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken
on the basis of these financial statements.

The extent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities including
fraud

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design
procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in
respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting
irregularities, including fraud is detailed below:

11

Gi Group Recruitment Limited
Registered number 01949160
31 December 2023

Independent auditors’ report to the members of Gi Group
Recruitment Limited (continued)

Our approach to identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement in respect of
irregularities, including fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations, was as follows:

e the senior statutory auditor ensured that the engagement team collectively had the
appropriate competence, capabilities and skills to identify or recognise non-compliance with
applicable laws and regulations;

e we identified the laws and regulations applicable to the company through discussions with
the director and other management, and from our commercial knowledge and experience of
the sector;

e we focused on specific laws and regulations which we considered may have a direct material
effect on the financial statements or the operations of the company, including the Companies
Act 2006, taxation legislation and data protection, anti-bribery, employment environmental
and health and safety legislation;

¢ we assessed the extent of compliance with the laws and regulations identified above through
making enquiries of management and inspecting legal correspondence; and

e identified laws and regulations were communicated within the audit team regularly and the
team remained alert to instances of non-compliance throughout the audit.

We assessed the susceptibility of the company's financial statements to material misstatement,
including obtaining an understanding of how fraud might occur, by:
e¢ making enquiries of management as to where they considered there was susceptibility to
fraud, their knowledge of actual, suspected and alleged fraud; and
e considering the internal controls in place to mitigate risks of fraud and non-compliance with
laws and regulations.

To address the risk of fraud through management bias and override of controls, we:

performed analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationship;
tested journal entries to identify unusual transactions and, in particular, unusual account
combinations to revenue and expenses;

e assessed whether judgements and assumptions made in determining the accounting
estimates set out in note 3 were indicative of potential bias;
incorporated elements of unpredictability in our testing and;
investigated the rationale behind significant or unusual transactions.

In response to the risk of irregularities and non-compliance with laws and regulations, we designed
procedures which included, but were not limited to:

agreeing financial statement disclosures to underlying supporting documentation;

reading the minutes of meetings of those charged with governance;

enquiring of management as to actual and potential litigation and claims; and

reviewing correspondence with HMRC, relevant regulators such as Companies House and
the company's legal advisors.

There are inherent limitations in our audit procedures described above. The more removed that laws
and regulations are from financial transactions, the less likely it is that we would become aware of
non-compliance. Auditing standards also limit the audit procedures required to identify non-
compliance with laws and regulations to enquiry of the director and ¢ other management and the
inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence, if any.

Material misstatements that arise due to fraud can be harder to detect than those that arise from
error as they may involve deliberate concealment or collusion.

A further description of our responsibilities is available on the Financial Reporting Council’s website
at: httos://www.fre.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor's report.

31 December 2023

Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)

3 Accounting policies (continued)

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with FRS 102 requires the use of certain critical
accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise judgement in the process of applying
the company’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity,
or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements are disclosed in
these notes.

The presentation currency of these financial statements is sterling, which is the functional currency of
the company. All amounts in the financial statements have been rounded to the nearest £1.

Going concern

As part of the going concern assessment, the Directors have considered the company's principal risk
areas, including the current economic condition that they consider material to the assessment of going
concern including completed cash flow forecasts for at least 12 months from now, considering severe
but plausible downsides too. They have also considered the facilities available to the company,
including its invoice discounting facility and ongoing support from Gi Group Holding S.p.A.. Having
completed this assessment, the Directors believe that preparing the financial statements on the going
concern basis is appropriate due to the continued financial support of Gi Group Holding S.p.A. The
Directors have received written confirmation that Gi Group Holding S.p.A intends to support the
company for at least one year from the date of signing of these financial statements.

Turnover :

Turnover comprises the amount derived from services falling within the company's activities after
deduction of trade discounts, rebates and excluding Value Added Tax. Turnover is recognised to the
extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the company and the revenue can be
reliably measured.

Turnover is derived from the company's principal activity and is attributable to the UK market. Income
received in advance of services provided is taken to deferred revenue.

Turnover for temporary workers is recognised in the period the work took place. Fees for permanent
placements are agreed in advance with the customer, with turnover being recognised when the
candidate commences employment.

The costs relating to the provision of operational staff is classified as a cost of sale.

Basis of investments
In the financial statements, investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less impairments.

Goodwill and amortisation

The goodwill arising on the transfer of trade and net assets is capitalised and amortised over its
expected useful life, being 20 years. Goodwill is assessed for impairment when there are indicators of
impairment and any impairment is charged to the income statement. No reversals of impairment are
recognised.

Tangible assets

Tangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Cost includes the original purchase price, costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to its working
condition for its intended use, dismantling and restoration costs.

Where parts of an item of tangible assets have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate
items of tangible assets.

The company assesses at each reporting date whether tangible assets are impaired.
Depreciation is charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
lives of each part of an item of tangible assets. The estimated useful lives are as follows:

Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)

3 Accounting policies (continued)

« Leasehold improvements the shorter of the period of the lease or 10 year:
e Fixtures and fittings 3-5 years :
e Office equipment 3-5 years

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed if there is an indication of a
significant change since last annual reporting date in the pattern by which the company expects to
consume an asset's future economic benefits.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements

The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions that affect the application of the accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities, revenue and expenses. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity
or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements are disclosed
below:

Impairment of trade and other debtors

The company makes an estimate of the recoverable amount of trade and other debtors. When
assessing impairment of trade and other debtors, management considers factors including the current
credit rating of the debtor, the ageing profile of debtors and historical experience. The assessment for
the recovery of amounts owed by group undertakings is based on the financial support offered from the
parent company. See note 14 for the net carrying amount of the debtors and associated impairment
provision.

Basic financial instruments

Trade and other debtors / creditors

Trade and other debtors are recognised initially at transaction price plus attributable transaction costs.
Trade and other creditors are recognised initially at transaction price less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest
method, less any impairment losses in the case of trade debtors. If the arrangement constitutes a
financing transaction, for example if payment is deferred beyond normal business terms, then it is
measured at the present value of future payments discounted at a market rate of instrument for a similar
debt instrument.

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term
highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. The company has in place a
confidential invoice discounting facility where the counterparty has full recourse to all monies advanced
against book debts, and for one client a factoring agreement is in place.

Employee Benefits
The company provides a range of benefits to employees, including annual bonus arrangements, paid
holiday arrangements and defined contribution plans.

A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which the company pays fixed
contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further
amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an
expense in the profit and loss account in the periods during which services are rendered by employees.
The assets of the plan are held separately from the company in independently administered funds.

Holiday pay and other similar non-monetary benefits, are recognised as an expense in the period in
which the service is received. .

Expenses

Operating leases

Leases that do not transfer all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as operating leases.
Payments (excluding costs for services and insurance) made under operating leases are recognised in
the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease unless the payments to
the lessor are structured to increase in line with expected general inflation; in which case the payments
related to the structured increases are recognised as incurred. Lease incentives received are
recognised in profit and loss over the term of the lease as an integral part of the total lease expense.

Interest receivable and interest payable

Interest payable and similar charges include interest payable, finance charges on shares classified as
liabilities and finance leases recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method, unwinding
of the discount on provisions, and net foreign exchange gains or losses that are recognised in the profit
and loss account (see Foreign currency accounting policy).

Other interest receivable and similar income include interest receivable on intercompany loans.

Interest income and interest payable are recognised in profit or loss as they accrue, using the effective
interest method. Foreign currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis.

Foreign currency accounting

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the spot exchange rates
at the date of the transactions. At each period end foreign currency monetary items measured at
historical cost are translated using the exchange rate at the closing rate and non-monetary items
measured at fair value are measured using the exchange rate when fair value was determined. Foreign
exchange gains and losses are presented in the profit and loss account within ‘Administrative expenses’.

Exceptional items
Items of income and expense that are material by size and/or nature and are non-recurring are classified
as exceptional items in the profit and loss account within their relevant category.

Taxation

Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the profit
and loss account except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity or other
comprehensive income, in which case it is recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income.

Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using
tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable
in respect of previous years.

Deferred tax is provided on timing differences which arise from the inclusion of income and expenses
in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the financial
statements. The following timing differences are not provided for: differences between accumulated
depreciation and tax allowances for the cost of a fixed asset if and when all conditions for retaining the
tax allowances have been met; and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries, to the extent that
it is not probable that they will reverse in the foreseeable future and the reporting entity is able to control
the reversal of the timing difference. Deferred tax is not recognised on permanent differences arising
because certain types of income or expense are non-taxable or are disallowable for tax or because
certain tax charges or allowances are greater or smaller than the corresponding income or expense.

Deferred tax is provided in respect of the additional tax that will be paid or avoided on differences
between the amount at which an asset (other than goodwill) or liability is recognised in a business
combination and the corresponding amount that can be deducted or assessed for tax. Goodwill is _
adjusted by the amount of such deferred tax.

Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)

3 Accounting policies (continued)

Deferred tax is measured at the tax rate that is expected to apply to the reversal of the related difference,
using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax balances are
not discounted.

Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that is it probable
that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.

Dividends on shares presented within shareholders’ funds

Dividends are only recognised as a liability at that date to the extent that they are declared and approved
by the shareholders prior to the year end. Unpaid dividends that do not meet these criteria are disclosed
in the notes to the financial statements.

As a subsidiary undertaking of Gi Group Holding S.p.A. the company has taken advantage of the
