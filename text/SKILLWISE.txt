Notes to the Accounts
for the year ended 31 March 2024

1 Accounting policies

Basis of preparation

The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with
FRS 102, The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland (as
applied to small entities by section 1A of the standard).

Turnover

Turnover is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of
discounts and value added taxes. Turnover includes revenue earned from the sale of goods
and from the rendering of services. Turnover from the sale of goods is recognised when the
significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have transferred to the buyer. Turnover
from the rendering of services is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the
contract. The stage of completion of a contract is measured by comparing the costs incurred
for work performed to date to the total estimated contract costs.

Intangible fixed assets

Intangible fixed assets are measured at cost less accumulative amortisation and any
accumulative impairment losses.

Tangible fixed assets

Tangible fixed assets are measured at cost less accumulative depreciation and any
accumulative impairment losses. Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets, other
than freehold land, at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of
each asset evenly over its expected useful life, as follows:

Freehold buildings over 50 years
Leasehold land and buildings over the lease term
Plant and machinery 10% Net book value
Fixtures, fittings, tools and equipment over 5 years
investments

Investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are measured at cost less any
accumulated impairment losses. Listed investments are measured at fair value. Unlisted
investments are measured at fair value unless the value cannot be measured reliably, in which
case they are measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Changes in fair value
are included in the profit and loss account.

Stocks

Stocks are measured at the lower of cost and estimated selling price less costs to complete
and sell. Cost is determined using the first in first out method. The carrying amount of stock
sold is recognised as an expense in the period in which the related revenue is recognised.

Debtors

Short term debtors are measured at transaction price (which is usually the invoice price), less
any impairment losses for bad and doubtful debts. Loans and other financial assets are initially
recognised at transaction price including any transaction costs and subsequently measured at

amortised cost determined using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses for
bad and doubtful debts.

Creditors

Short term creditors are measured at transaction price (which is usually the invoice price).
Loans and other financial liabilities are initially recognised at transaction price net of any
transaction costs and subsequently measured at amortised cost determined using the effective
interest method.

Taxation

A current tax liability is recognised for the tax payable on the taxable profit of the current and
past periods. A current tax asset is recognised in respect of a tax loss that can be carried back
to recover tax paid in a previous period. Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing
differences between the recognition of income and expenses in the financial statements and
their inclusion in tax assessments. Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are
recognised only to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered against the reversal
of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits. Deferred tax is measured using the tax
rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and that
are expected to apply to the reversal of the timing difference, except for revalued land and
investment property where the tax rate that applies to the sale of the asset is used. Current and
deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.

Provisions

Provisions (ie liabilities of uncertain timing or amount) are recognised when there is an
obligation at the reporting date as a result of a past event, it is probable that economic benefit
will be transferred to settle the obligation and the amount of the obligation can be estimated
reliably.

Foreign currency translation

Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recognised at the rate of exchange ruling at the
date of the transaction. At the end of each reporting period foreign currency monetary items are
translated at the closing rate of exchange. Non-monetary items that are measured at historical
cost are translated at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction. All differences are charged
to profit or loss.

Leased assets

A lease is classified as a finance lease if it transfers substantially all the risks and rewards
incidental to ownership. All other leases are classified as operating leases. The rights of use
and obligations under finance leases are initially recognised as assets and liabilities at amounts
equal to the fair value of the leased assets or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease
payments. Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the
reduction in the outstanding liability using the effective interest rate method. The finance
charge is allocated to each period during the lease so as to produce a constant periodic rate of
interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Leased assets are depreciated in accordance
with the company's policy for tangible fixed assets. If there is no reasonable certainty that
ownership will be obtained at the end of the lease term, the asset is depreciated over the lower
of the lease term and its useful life. Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense
on a straight line basis over the lease term.

Pensions

Contributions to defined contribution plans are expensed in the period to which they relate.
