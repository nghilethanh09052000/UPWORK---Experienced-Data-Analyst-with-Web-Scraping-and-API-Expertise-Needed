Notes to the Financial Statements
For The Year Ended 31 July 2024

1. General Information

JL D Driver Training Limited is a private company, limited by shares, incorporated in England & Wales, registered
number 06681666 . The registered office is 10 Manor Park, Banbury, Oxfordshire, OX16 3TB.

2. Accounting Policies
2.1. Basis of Preparation of Financial Statements
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with
Financial Reporting Standard 102 section 1A Small Entities "The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the
UK and Republic of Ireland" and the Companies Act 2006.

2.2. Turnover

Turnover is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of discounts and value
added taxes. Turnover includes revenue earned from the sale of goods and from the rendering of services.
Turnover is reduced for estimated customer returns, rebates and other similar allowances.

Sale of goods

Turnover from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods
has transferred to the buyer. This is usually at the point that the customer has signed for the delivery of the
goods.

Rendering of services

Turnover from the rendering of services is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract.
The stage of completion of a contract is measured by comparing the costs incurred for work performed to date
to the total estimated contract costs. Turnover is only recognised to the extent of recoverable expenses when
the outcome of a contract cannot be estimated reliably.

2.3. Tangible Fixed Assets and Depreciation

Tangible fixed assets are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment
losses. Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost of the fixed assets, less their estimated
residual value, over their expected useful lives on the following bases:

Plant & Machinery 15% on reducing balance
Motor Vehicles 20% on reducing balance
Fixtures & Fittings 15% on reducing balance

2.4. Leasing and Hire Purchase Contracts

Assets obtained under finance leases are capitalised as tangible fixed assets. Assets acquired under finance
leases are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives. Assets acquired under hire
purchase contracts are depreciated over their useful lives. Finance leases are those where substantially all of
the benefits and risks of ownership are assumed by the company. Obligations under such agreements are
included in the creditors net of the finance charge allocated to future periods. The finance element of the rental
payment is charged to the profit and loss account so as to produce a constant periodic rate of charge on the net
obligation outstanding in each period.

Rentals applicable to operating leases where substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership remain with
the lessor are charged to profit and loss account as incurred.

For The Year Ended 31 July 2024

2.5. Taxation
Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.

The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in
the statement of comprehensive income because of items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible
in other years and items that are never taxable or deductible. The company's liability for current tax is calculated
using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.

Deferred tax is recognised on timing differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the
financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax
liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable timing differences. Deferred tax assets are generally
recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be
available against which those deductible timing differences can be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred tax
assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable
that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in
which the liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. Deferred tax liabilities are presented within provisions
for liabilities and deferred tax assets within debtors. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets
reflect the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Company expects, at the end of
the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.

Current or deferred tax for the year is recognised in profit or loss, except when they related to items that are
recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax is
also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.
