STRATEGIC REPORT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2024
- 1 -
The directors present the strategic report for the year ended 31 March 2024.
Principal activity and review of the business
Synergy Health (UK) Limited (the "
c
ompany") provides the health care industry with services, under its
Instrument Management Services (‘IMS’) division. The
c
ompany provides a high quality instrument sterilisation
service for reusable medical and surgical equipment used in operating theatres and other hospital departments.
The company also sells consumable medical products.
Details of the results for the year are given below. The company was able to negotiate price increases which, coupled with higher processing volumes, increased revenue. Whilst operating expenses in general rose, a large impairment in the prior year means that the overall performance of the company has increased compared to prior year.
Principal risks and uncertainties
Within the
c
ompany, the necessary framework has been established to ensure sufficient review of the risks and
the opportunity to regularly review the adequacy and effectiveness of our mitigating controls and strategies.
Risk management supports the
c
ompany’s vision to build a lasting reputation and our core values by:
•
building and protecting the
c
ompany’s reputation by championing a responsible approach to business;
•
achieving brand and business resilience supported by effective risk management;
•
developing the culture and capability across the
c
ompany to manage changing risks and opportunities;
and
•
ensuring the safety and well-being of employees and others who could be affected by our business
activities.
The risk management strategy enables and supports the
c
ompany to identify and manage its own risks. This is
accomplished by embedding risk management and translating risk management into operational ownership,
defining clear responsibilities and measuring risk management performance.
Foreign exchange risk
The
c
ompany has limited exposure to foreign currency as it operates in the UK and all of its trade and most of
its purchases are procured in pound sterling. At each reporting date all financial assets and financial liabilities
are denominated in pound sterling.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that an entity will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations with financial liabilities. The
c
ompany aims to mitigate liquidity risk by managing cash generation by its operations and applying cash
collection targets throughout the
c
ompany.
The company also has the ability to draw down on both intercompany loans and the group wide cash pooling structure if needed.
Financial risks
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the
c
ompany if a Customer or counterparty to a financial instrument
fails to meet its contractual obligations and arises principally from the
c
ompany’s receivables from Customers.
The
c
ompany has no significant concentration of credit risk. The amounts presented in the
b
alance
s
heet are
net of allowances for impairment.
Management has credit policies in place to manage risk and to monitor
exposure to risk on an ongoing basis. These include the use of Customer specific credit limits based on third
party credit reports and in cases of Customer default or requests for credit above agreed limits the use of pro
forma invoices to secure payment in advance of delivery. Given these factors and based on extensive past
experience, the
c
ompany believes that its financial assets are of good credit quality.

Section 172(1) statement
Section 172 states a director of a company must act in the way they consider, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole, and in doing so have regard (amongst other matters) to:
(a) the likely consequences of any decision in the long term,
(b) the interests of the company's employees,
(c) the need to foster the company's business relationships with suppliers, customers and others,
(d) the impact of the company's operations on the community and the environment,
(e) the desirability of the company maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct, and
(f) the need to act fairly between members of the company.
Synergy Health (UK) Limited is a 100% owned subsidiary within the STERIS plc group, and as with many international groups the directors delegate the day to day management of the company to local teams. The directors of Synergy Health (UK) Limited are U.S. based and are members of the STERIS plc management team. The company’s local management is structured to align the company’s objectives with that of the group, and to ensure the company follows group policies. Further details on these can be found in STERIS plc’s financial statements, which are available online or from 70 Sir John Rogerson’s Quay, Dublin 2, D02 R296, Ireland.
The directors of the company, and the board as a whole, receive routine reporting from their delegated management team and have regular updates to ensure the company continues to meet the directors’ expectations. Details of the KPIs monitored by the directors and the results for the year are detailed above.
The company identifies its key stakeholders as its shareholder, customers, suppliers, employees and regulators. The directors acknowledge that the views of, and effects on, these people in regard to key business objectives and decisions are of critical importance to the continued success of the company. Each of these stakeholders will have different expectations of the company and these are as follows:
Shareholder
– the shareholder expects the company to continue to provide a return on its capital and to continue to provide growth for future returns.
Customers
– All customers expect the company to provide a good service, this includes providing quality product on a timely basis and working closely with the customers to understand their needs and requirements.
Suppliers
– All suppliers expect the company to continue to settle its debts on a timely basis and provide a consistent purchase stream.
Employees
– the company’s employees want the company to provide a stable employment, for the company to engage and develop their skills and expertise and to provide fair remuneration.
Regulators
– the company is regulated by a number of external regulators due to the nature of the service it is providing. These regulators expect the company to produce a consistent service and output in a compliant manner. The other key regulator for the company is HMRC. HMRC expects the company to meet all compliance requirements and submit returns and payments as required, accurately and on time.

Quantification and reporting methodology
The information presented within this report has been prepared in accordance with the WRI/WBCSD Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG) to meet the 2019 HM Government Environmental Reporting Guidelines. We used the updated 2023 UK Government’s Conversion Factors for Company Reporting for scope 1 and 2 emission factors. For scope 3 emission factors we used the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) US Environmentally-Extended Input-Output (USEEIO) model.
Synergy Health (UK) Limited has made the decision to voluntarily disclose five categories of scope 3 emissions. The five categories of scope 3 emissions were upstream transportation and distribution, waste in operations, employee commuting, downstream transportation and distribution, and upstream leased assets. We have also voluntarily disclosed all emissions associated to the scope 3 emission category business travel beyond the SECR requirement for fuel consumed for rented and employee-owned vehicles. The amount of scope 3 emissions from fuel consumed for rented and employee-owned vehicles, includes the required portion from business travel and all voluntarily disclosed upstream leased assets at 1.00 and 984.00 metric tonnes of CO2 equivalence (tCO
2
e).
Aggregate of energy consumption in the year
includes all scope 1 and 2 (location-based) emission sources, all emission sources from upstream leased assets, and the mandatory scope 3 emission sources from business travel. Total location based scope 2 emissions, excludes emission reduction from procured renewable electricity from the reporting year, equal to 2,450.00 tCO2e. The total scope 3 emissions above includes the cumulative amount of emissions from all six described scope 3 categories. Total gross emissions includes total scope 1 emissions, market based scope 2 emissions, and total scope 3 emissions. Total market based scope 2 emissions, includes emission reduction from procured renewable electricity from the reporting year, equal to 1,004.00 tCO2e.
Intensity measurement
The chosen intensity measurement ratio is total gross emissions in metric tonnes CO2e per full time equivalent employee, the recommended ratio by the Environmental Reporting Guidelines: Including Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting Guidance.
Measures taken to improve energy efficiency
T
he following environmental management measures and projects have been completed or implemented.
Synergy Health (UK) Limited procured 6,337 MWh of renewable electricity, which was 59% of their scope 2 emissions.
We have implemented a plan to conduct an energy audit at a select location in accordance and preparation for Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme (ESOS) regulatory requirement.
Installed two electric vehicle chargers at select facilities within the business.

ertain
information required to be contained in the directors' report.
Statement of disclosure to auditor
So far as each person who was a director at the date of approving this report is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the company’s
auditor
is unaware. Additionally, the directors individually have taken all the necessary steps that they ought to have taken as directors in order to make themselves aware of all relevant audit information and to establish that the company’s
auditor
is aware of that information.
Going concern
The Company’s business activities, together with a review of the business and the impact of the principal risks and uncertainties have been described in the strategic report. For the year to 31 March 2024 the company made a profit amounting to £2,190,000 and had net assets of £147,455,000.

assessed the ability of STERIS Limited to provide support and
therefore have a reasonable expectation that the
company
has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly,
t

DIRECTORS' RESPONSIBILITIES STATEMENT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2024
- 7 -
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of the profit or loss of the company for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information;
state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements;
prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT
TO THE MEMBER OF SYNERGY HEALTH (UK) LIMITED

Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Synergy Health (UK) Limited (the 'company') for the year ended 31 March 2024 which comprise the statement of comprehensive income, the statement of financial position, the statement of changes in equity and notes to the financial statements, including significant accounting policies.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 102
The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
In our opinion the financial statements:
give a true and fair view of the state of the company's affairs as at 31 March 2024 and of its profit for the year then ended;
have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the
Auditor's
responsibilities for the audit of the
financial statements
section of our report. We are independent of the
company
in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the
financial statements
in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard
, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Conclusions relating to going concern
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.
Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.
Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report.
Other information
The other information comprises the information included in the annual report other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of our audit
:
the information given in the strategic report and the directors'
r
eport for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements
; and
the strategic report and the directors' report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identifie
d
material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors'
r
eport
.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
certain disclosures of
remuneration specified by law are not made; or
we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the directors'
r
esponsibilities
s
tatement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of
financial statements
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the
financial statements
, the
directors are
responsible for assessing the company
'
s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or have
no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements
as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an
auditor's
report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with
ISAs (UK)
will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these
financial statements
.
Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud
Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect irregularities, including fraud. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below. However, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the entity and management.
SYNERGY HEALTH (UK) LIMITED
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT
TO THE MEMBER OF SYNERGY HEALTH (UK) LIMITED (CONTINUED)
- 10 -
We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the company and determined that the most significant are those that relate to the reporting framework (FRS 102 and the Companies Act 2006) and compliance with the relevant direct tax regulation in the United Kingdom. In addition, the Company has to comply with laws and regulations relating to its operations, including occupational health and safety, environmental, General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and industry regulations and quality standards.
We understood how the Company is complying with those frameworks by making enquiries of management and those charged with governance to understand how the Company maintains and communicates its policies and procedures in these areas. We corroborated our enquiries through our review of minutes of the meetings of those charged with governance. We understood any controls put in place by management to reduce the opportunities for fraudulent transactions and how monitoring of these processes is done to avoid any instance of non-compliance.
We assessed the susceptibility of the company’s financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur by meeting with management to understand where they considered there was susceptibility to fraud. We considered the processes and controls that the Company had established to address identified risks, or that otherwise prevent or detect fraud; and how management monitors those processes and controls. Where the risk was considered to be higher, in particular in respect of adjustments to revenue arising other than through routine invoicing with the Company’s customers, we performed audit procedures to address this identified fraud risk. These procedures included obtaining the population of all journals processed during the year. We performed a three-way correlation between revenue, receivables and cash and obtained explanations for any material outliers. We also tested manual journals posted to revenue using professional judgement. We determined the sample based on either size or nature for further testing and agreed to source documentation. These procedures were designed to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements were free from material fraud.
Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations. Our procedures involved understanding management’s internal controls over compliance with laws and regulations, enquiries of management, vouching transactions to source documentation and verifying that they are recorded in compliance with FRS 102 and in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
A further description of our responsibilities is available on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at: https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor's report.
Use of our report
This report is made solely to the company's member in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company's member those matters we are required to state to the member in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company's member, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Company information
Synergy Health (UK) Limited is a
private
company
limited by shares
incorporated in
England and Wales
.
The registered office is
2200 Renaissance, Basing View, Basingstoke, Hampshire, RG21 4EQ.
1.1
Accounting convention
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 102 “The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland” (“FRS 102”) and the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
The financial statements are prepared in
sterling
, which is the functional currency of the company.
Monetary a
mounts
in these financial statements are
rounded to the nearest £000.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
This company is a qualifying entity for the purposes of FRS 102, being a member of a group where the parent of that group prepares
publicly available consolidated financial statements
, including this company,
which are
intended to give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities,
financial position and profit or loss
of the group
.
T
he company has
therefore
taken advantage of
e
xemptions from the following disclosure requirements:
Section 7 ‘Statement of Cash Flows’: Presentation of a statement of cash flow and related notes and disclosures;
Section 11 ‘Basic Financial Instruments’ and Section 12 ‘Other Financial Instrument Issues’
:
Carrying amounts, interest income/expense and net gains/losses for each category of financial instrument;
basis
of determining fair values; details of collateral, loan defaults or breaches, details of hedges, hedging fair value changes recognised in profit or loss and in other comprehensive income
;
Section 26 ‘Share based Payment’
:
Share-based payment expense charged to profit or loss, reconciliation of opening and closing number and weighted average exercise price of share options, how the fair value of options granted was measured, measurement and carrying amount of liabilities for cash-settled share-based payments, explanation of modifications to arrangements
;
Section 33 ‘Related Party Disclosures’
:
Compensation for key management personnel
.
The financial statements of the company are consolidated in the financial statements of
STERIS plc
. These consolidated financial statements are available from its registered office
, 70 Sir John Rogerson's Quay, Dublin 2, D02 R296, Ireland.
The company has taken advantage of the exemption under section 40
1
of the
Companies Act 2006 not to prepare consolidated accounts. The
financial statements
present information about the company as an individual entity and not about its group
.
1.2
Going concern
The Company’s business activities, together with a review of the business and the impact of the principal risks and uncertainties have been described in the strategic report. For the year to 31 March 2024 the company made a profit amounting to £2,190,000 and had net assets of £147,455,000. The company has also received confirmation from its intermediate parent undertaking, STERIS Limited, of its intention to provide support, where needed, for a period of 12 months from the date of approval of the accounts. T
true
he directors have
assessed the ability of STERIS Limited to provide support and
therefore have a reasonable expectation that the
company
has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly,
t
he directors continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.

1.3
Turnover
Turnover is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business
, and
is shown net of VAT and other sales related taxes
.
The fair value of consideration takes into account trade discounts, settlement discounts and volume rebates.
Turnover from the sale of goods is recognised at the point the goods are despatched. Turnover from the provision of services is recognised when the service has been performed.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholder's right to receive payment has been established.
1.4
Research and development expenditure
Research expenditure is written off against profits in the year in which it is incurred. Identifiable development expenditure is capitalised to the extent that the technical, commercial and financial feasibility can be demonstrated
.
1.5
Intangible fixed assets - goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition of unincorporated businesses over the fair value of net assets acquired. It is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less accumulated
amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is considered to have a finite useful life and is amortised on a systematic basis over its expected life, which is 20 years.
1.6
Intangible fixed assets other than goodwill
Intangible assets are initially recognised at cost. After recognition, under the cost model, intangible
assets are measured at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment
losses. Costs incurred in setting up long term arrangements are capitalised as intangible assets and
amortised over the life of the contract to which the costs relate
.
Amortisation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over their useful lives on the following bases:
Other intangibles
12 years straight line
1.7
Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets
are initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost, net of depreciation and any impairment losses.
Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over their useful lives on the following bases:
Land and buildings
See below
Plant, machinery and office equipment
3-10 years straight line
Freehold buildings are depreciated on a 50 year straight line basis. Leasehold property is depreciated over the life of the lease.
Freehold land and assets in the course of construction are not depreciated.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying value of the asset, and
is credited or charged to the statement of comprehensive income.

1.8
Fixed asset investments
Investments
in subsidiaries
are initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
The investments are assessed for impairment at each reporting date
and
any
impairment
losses or reversals of impairment losses are recognised immediately in
profit
or
loss
.
1.9
Impairment of fixed assets
At each reporting
period
end date, the
company
reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible
and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the
company
estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in
profit
or
loss
, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Recognised impairment losses
, excluding those relating to goodwill,
are reversed if, and only if, the reasons for the impairment loss have ceased to apply. Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit)
in
prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in
profit
or
loss.
1.10
Stocks
Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value, being the estimated selling price less
costs to complete and sell. Cost is based on the cost of purchase on a weighted average basis.
Work in progress and finished goods include labour and attributable overheads.
Stocks held for distribution at no or nominal consideration are measured at the lower of replacement cost and cost, adjusted where applicable for any loss of service potential.
At each reporting date, an assessment is made for impairment. Any excess of the carrying amount of stocks over its estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell is recognised as an impairment loss in profit or loss. Reversals of impairment losses are also recognised in profit or loss.
1.11
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents
are basic financial assets
and
include cash in hand
and
deposits held with banks
repayable without penalty on notice of not more than 24 hours.

1.12
Financial instruments
The company has elected to apply the provisions of Section 11 ‘Basic Financial Instruments’ and Section 12 ‘Other Financial Instruments Issues’ of FRS 102 to all of its financial instruments.
Financial instruments are recognised in the company's statement of financial position when the company becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset
, with
the net amounts presented in the financial statements
,
when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Basic financial assets
Basic financial assets, which include
debtors
and cash and bank balances, are initially measured at transaction price including transaction costs and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest
method unless the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where the transaction is measured at the present value of the future receipts discounted at a market rate of interest.
Other financial assets
Other financial assets, including investments in equity instruments which are not subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures, are initially measured at fair value, which is normally the transaction price. Such assets are subsequently carried at fair value and the changes in fair value are recognised in
profit
or
loss
, except that investments in equity instruments that are not publicly traded and whose fair values cannot be measured reliably are measured at cost less impairment.
Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets, other than those
held
at
fair value through profit and loss
, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each reporting end date.
Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows have been affected.
If an asset is impaired, the impairment loss is the difference between the carrying amount and the present value of the estimated cash flows discounted at the asset’s original effective interest rate. The impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss.
If there is a decrease in the impairment loss arising from an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the impairment is reversed. The reversal is such that the current carrying amount does not exceed what the carrying amount would have been, had the impairment not previously been recognised. The impairment reversal is recognised in profit or loss.
Derecognition of financial assets
Financial assets are derecognised only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or are settled, or when
the company
transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to another entity, or if some significant risks and rewards of ownership are retained but control of the asset has transferred to another party that is able to sell the asset in its entirety to an unrelated third party.
Basic financial liabilities
Basic financial liabilities, including
creditors and
loans from
fellow group companies, are
initially recognised at transaction price unless the arrangement constitutes a
financing transaction, where the debt instrument is measured at the present value of
the future
paymen
ts discounted at a market rate of interest.
Financial liabilities classified as payable within one year are not amortised.
Debt instruments are subsequently carried at amortised cost, using the effective
interest rate method.

Other financial liabilities
Derivatives, including interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts,
are not basic financial instruments.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are
s
ubsequently re-measured at their fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognised in
profit
or
loss
in finance costs or finance income as appropriate, unless hedge accounting is applied and the hedge is a cash flow hedge.
Debt instruments that do not meet the conditions in FRS 102 paragraph 11.9 are subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss. Debt instruments may be designated as
being measured at
fair value th
r
ough profit or loss to eliminate or reduce an accounting mismatch or if the instruments are measured and their performance evaluated on a fair value basis in accordance with a documented risk management or investment strategy.
Derecognition of financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the company’s contractual obligations
expire or are discharged or cancelled.
1.13
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Current tax
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the
income statement
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The
company’s
liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting end date.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all timing differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the timing difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting end date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the
income statement
, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the
company
has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority.

Retirement benefits
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Certain of the
c
ompany’s employees are members of the Synergy Health plc Retirement Benefits
Scheme, a defined benefit pension plan. Synergy Health (UK) Limited is the principal employer entity
legally responsible for this defined benefit pension plan. The net defined benefit cost of the pension plan and the net defined benefit liability are recognised
fully by the
c
ompany.
The cost of providing benefits under
the above
defined benefit plan is determined using the projected unit credit method, and is based on actuarial advice.
The change in the net defined benefit liability arising from employee service during the year is recognised as an employee cost. The cost of plan introductions, benefit changes, settlements and curtailments are recognised as an expense in measuring profit or loss in the period in which they arise.
The net interest element is determined by multiplying the net defined benefit liability by the discount rate, taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit liability during the period as a result of contribution and benefit payments. The net interest is recognised in
profit
or
loss
as other finance revenue or cost.
Remeasurement changes comprise actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling and the return on the net defined benefit liability excluding amounts included in net interest. These are recognised immediately in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur and are not reclassified to profit and loss in subsequent periods.
The
net
defined benefit pension asset or liability in the balance sheet comprises the total of the present value of the defined benefit obligation (using a discount rate based on high quality corporate bonds), less the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly. Fair value is based on market price information, and in the case of quoted securities is the published bid price. The value of a net pension benefit asset is limited to the amount that may be recovered either through reduced contributions or agreed refunds from the scheme.
1.15
Share-based payments
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
A corresponding adjustment is made to equity.
1.16
Leases
Rentals payable under operating leases,
including
any lease incentives received, are charged to
profit or loss
on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease except where another more systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the lease
d
asset are consumed.
1.17
Government grants
Government grants are recognised at the fair value of the asset receive
d
or receivable when there is reasonable assurance that the grant conditions will be met and the grants will be received.
A grant that specifies performance conditions is recognised in income when the performance conditions are met
.
Where a
grant does not specify performance conditions
it
is recognised in income when the proceeds are received or receivable
. A grant received before the recognition criteria are satisfied is recognised as a liability.

Foreign exchange
Transactions in currencies other than
pounds sterling
are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At each reporting end date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the reporting end date. Gains and losses arising on translation
in the period
are included in profit or loss.
2
Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the company’s accounting policies, the directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised where the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods where the revision affects both current and future periods.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The estimates and assumptions which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities are
as follows:
Goodwill and intangible assets
The
c
ompany establishes a reliable estimate of the useful life of goodwill and intangible assets arising on
business combinations.
This estimate is based upon a variety of factors such as the expected use of the
acquired business, the expected useful life of the cash generating units to which the goodwill is attributed
and the expected life of any legal or regulatory provisions.
Pension benefits
The cost of defined benefit pension plans are determined using actuarial valuations.
The actuarial
valuation involves making assumptions about discount rates, inflation, future salary increases, mortality
rates and future pension increases (see note
22
). Due to the complexity of the valuation, the underlying
assumptions and the long-term nature of these plans, such estimates are subject to significant
uncertainty.
In relation to the
co
mpany’s defined benefit pension scheme, actuarial assumptions are
established using relevant market benchmark data and with the advice of external qualified actuaries.
Pension deficit valuations are most sensitive to changes in the underlying discount rate and inflation
assumptions.
Impairment of non-financial assets
Where there are indicators of impairment of non financial assets, the
c
ompany performs impairment
tests based on fair value less cost
s
to sell or a value in use calculation. The fair value less costs to sell
calculation is based on available market data less incremental costs for disposing of the asset. The value
in use calculation is based on best estimates,
g
roup adjusted discount rates and UK growth rates.
Impairment losses are recognised if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.

Contributions totalling
£
223
,000 (20
23
: £

NHS Pension Scheme
The
c
ompany participates in the NHS Pension Scheme (‘NHSPS’). The NHSPS is an unfunded
occupational
s
cheme which is open to all employees of the NHS and the employees of certain other
approved organisations. The NHSPS provides pension and other benefits for members based on final
salary, and receives contributions from employees and employers to defray the costs of those benefits.
As the NHSPS is an unfunded scheme, these liabilities are underwritten in full by the UK Government.
Under the specific exemptions within FRS102 Section 28 'Employee Benefits', the NHSP
S
is treated as a
defined contribution scheme within these financial statements. The total cost charged to the income
statement
, and included within defined contribution costs above,
in respect of this scheme was £
199,000
(20
23
: £
195,000
).
Defined benefit schemes

The company is the principal employer for the Synergy Health plc Retirement Benefits scheme ('the Synergy Scheme').
The most recent actuarial valuations of plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation were carried out at
31 March 2021, rolled forward on an approximate basis to 31 March 2024.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation, the related current service cost and past service cost were measured using the projected unit credit method.

he
c
ompany has agreed with the Trustees of the schemes that
the following
future contributions will be
payable:
Contributions by active members
-
In line with amounts deducted from employees in line with the rules
