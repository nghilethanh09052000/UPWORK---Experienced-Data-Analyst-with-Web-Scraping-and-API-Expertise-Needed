Strategic report

The directors present their strategic report of Network Rail Infrastructure Limited (NRIL or the
company) for the year ended 31 March 2024.

Who we are and what we do

Our purpose is to get people and goods to where they need to be, and in turn to support the UK’s
economic prosperity. Our role is to run a safe, reliable and efficient railway, serving our customers
and communities. We oversee the running of the railway as an entire system and work closely with
train operators to deliver train services as safely, reliably and punctually as possible. We lead the
industry’s planning for the future of the railway, and we're committed to a sustainability agenda.

How are we structured

To help us provide the best service for passengers and freight in each part of the country, we work
closely with train operators. To do this we're organised into five geographical regions, each with its
own managing director who is a member of the Executive Leadership Team.

Those regions are sub-divided into a total of 14 routes. As a result of our devolution programme,
many decisions that were previously taken centrally, now take place at region or route level. The
people making the decisions are closer to their passengers and freight users and have a better
understanding of what they need. This enables us to deliver any changes more effectively.

Our regions are also supported by our national functions, who make sure they have everything they
need to succeed. System Operator takes a whole-system view of the railway and provides industry
leadership in the development of long-term network strategies and advice to funders. Its work
integrates the railway service we hope to deliver and the production of the railway timetable. Route
Services supports our routes, regions and functions by providing network operations, freight,
telecoms and technical expertise, and a number of different customer-focussed services to regional
customers and other parts of our business. Route Services includes, among other teams:
commercial and procurement; supply chain operations; business services; IT services; asset
information services; and engineering services. Technical Authority has network-wide accountability
- in accordance with our Licence to Operate and Safety Authorisation - for setting and monitoring
compliance with the policy, strategy and control frameworks relating to safety; engineering; asset
management; security; and environment and sustainability.

Network Rail is a public sector company, answerable to the Department for Transport (DfT) and
Transport Scotland. Our board includes a non-executive chair, executive directors and non-
executive directors. The chair aims to ensure our policies and actions support the wider strategic
policies of the Secretary of State for Transport and the Scottish Ministers.

We are independently regulated by the Office of Rail and Road (ORR). The ORR decides how much
money it believes we need to run our business efficiently and to deliver what the UK and Scottish
governments have asked for in each five-year control period.

How we're funded

Our income is a mix of grants from the UK and Scottish Governments; payments from train and
freight operators that use the railway; and a small amount of income from our real estate portfolio,
e.g., rental income from shops at stations. We also work closely with organisations willing to pay for
projects that benefit them, our passengers and our freight users.

We work in five-year funding cycles called Control Periods (CP). The UK and Scottish Governments
let us know what they need from the railway network in each CP and how much they can afford to
pay for it. The 2023/24 financial year is the fifth and final year of CP6, which runs from 1 April 2019
to 31 March 2024. It is our responsibility to deliver a railway which is efficient, reliable and safe. We
must deliver reliable train performance daily and we're held to account for this throughout the CPs.

OFFICIAL

Network Rail Infrastructure Limited

Strategic report (continued)

The Office of Rail and Road (ORR), our independent regulator, fixes the amount we can charge train
operating companies for using the railway network. The amount charged to train operating
companies is reduced by grants received from the UK and Scottish Governments.

Network Rail’s vision
Our vision is
“Putting Passengers First”

We're continuing to implement our vision to be a company that’s on the side of passengers and
freight users. We want to be considered efficient, dependable and a company people are proud to
work for. We've embedded a customer service mindset across our business to support this vision.

We developed our Putting Passengers First vision to address feedback received from customers,
stakeholders and employees in 2018. It accords with our intention to deliver a more sustainable,
efficient and joined-up railway. We identified six strategic priorities for delivering our vision. They're a
vital consideration in the stakeholder actions we take.

And we organised our business to bring decision making closer to those we serve, making sure that
the regions and routes meet the needs of their passengers, customers and communities.

We're reliant on our people to ensure that we can implement our vision to put passengers first. Our
corporate values accord with our customer service mindset and our Putting Passengers First vision.
And we’re making it easier for our partners and suppliers across the industry to work with us.

Our Culture

To complement our putting passengers first vision, we’ve embedded a customer service mindset
across our business. Embodying this mindset, and to help our people understand how they can put
passengers first, we have defined our corporate values:

We empower our people to always be safe, care about the railway, its users and each other, and to
put teamwork at the heart of all that we do.

These values include our corporate behaviours which are accountability, challenge, collaboration
and customer focus.

Our customer service mindset applies to Network Rail colleagues, irrespective of the part of the
business they work in, and to other stakeholders. It defines how we work with our colleagues within
Network Rail and our other stakeholders, such as those living next to or close by the railway, and the
train operating companies.

Our role

“Running a safe, reliable and efficient railway, serving customers and
communities.”

Our role is to deliver a railway that people can rely on, with trains that turn up and arrive at their
destination on time, and where passengers can feel confident that they are in safe hands. Reliable
train performance is what we must deliver daily, and what we should and will be held to account for
throughout the control period.

Network Rail Infrastructure Limited

Strategic report (continued)

Our strategic priorities
Our six strategic themes

Our plans for CP7 are underpinned by our six strategic themes. These are directly derived from our
vision, role and purpose. They provide structure and clarity to our thinking, covering what we'll do
and how we'll do it, so that we deliver the railway that Britain needs, and passengers deserve.

Safety and train service delivery represent the fundamental pillars of delivering a great service for
passengers and freight users. As an organisation which receives significant taxpayer funding, we
have a duty to be efficient in our use of public resources, and to support the sustainable growth of
the economy. We know that our people are key to us delivering on our commitments. Our focus on
customers and communities keeps outcomes and our impact on the wider community at the heart
of our decision making. The following pages show just some examples of the work we're doing in
each area.

Safety

Our safety vision is Everyone Home Safe Every Day. Safely running the country’s railway is of
paramount importance to us. Our safety vision applies to passengers; other members of the public
(for example, those living and working near the railway); our employees; and our contractors. Safety
is a vital factor in the decisions we make during our works on the railway. We regularly measure our
safety performance to help us to continually improve and work towards achieving our safety vision.

Train service delivery
We understand that passengers want a punctual and reliable train service. We're focussed on

reducing delays and disruption for passengers and freight users by seeking to stop faults occurring.
Improving both how we work and the technology we use to quickly find and fix faults means that we
can return service levels to normal as promptly as possible.

Efficiency

The delivery of an affordable and efficient railway is a key priority. A substantial proportion of our
funding comes from taxpayers. We understand our responsibility to spend this money wisely and to
work as efficiently as possible to deliver value to our customers. The greater our efficiency, the more
money we have to invest in providing an improved service for passengers.

We're continuing to use the latest technology and practices to speed up our work safely, both on and
off the track. Completing improvement work more quickly means we’re saving money and causing
less delay and disruption for passengers and freight users.

Sustainable growth
It remains the case that one of our priorities is to work to improve the railway infrastructure where

there is a strong business case to do so. We reported on our Environmental Sustainability Strategy
2020-2050 in 2022/23. It commits us to delivering a low emission railway (we've set ourselves a
reduction in carbon emissions target to be met by the end of the current Control Period); a reliable
railway service that's resilient to climate change, with improved biodiversity of plants and wildlife;
and minimal waste.and sustainable use of materials. See the Environmental Sustainability section in
Network Rail Limited’s 2024 accounts.

Customers and communities

We're continuing to improve the service we provide to our customers and communities by listening
to what they need and responding appropriately. We regularly review feedback and carry out
engagement to ensure that we’re a collaborative partner that puts our passengers first. We work with
our train operator partners to develop local plans for improvements at the stations we manage,
focusing in particular on how we make them accessible to our customers and communities with their
diverse range of needs. We continue to work closely with lineside neighbours — the people and
businesses who live and work next to the railway — to minimise the impact our track works may have
on them. We've also continued to reduce the time it takes us to respond to any complaints we
receive.

Strategic report (continued)

Our strategic priorities (continued)

People
We can only achieve our vision of putting passengers first if we employ the best people. To help us

attract and retain the best, we must create an environment in which people can bring their whole
selves to work. We need our people to feel safe to be who they are without fear of discrimination,
and we need to offer them an environment in which they can fulfil their potential and feel valued. A
diverse workforce will reflect the diversity of our passengers, the communities we serve and in which
we operate; it will help us to understand and address what people need from us.

Our operating model ~ How we are organised

We are organised into five geographical regions, each with its own managing director, see map in
NRL accounts. Those regions are sub-divided into a total of 14 routes. As a result of our devolution
programme, many decisions that were previously taken centrally, now take place at region or route
level. The people making the decisions are closer to their passengers and freight users and have a
better understanding of what they need. This enables us to deliver any changes more effectively.

Regions lead on local resourcing strategy and planning activities, bringing together engineering
capability and management of our assets: these include track, bridges, signals, cuttings, etc. The
regions are accountable for improving the railway network within their geographies, and are
responsible for aspects of longer-term planning, including timetables and project business case
development.

Routes are responsible for running the railway on a day-to-day basis. This includes carrying out
repairs to our assets over the short to medium term. For more information on each region, please
see their individual reports (refer to NRL accounts)

Our Route Services directorate supports our routes, regions and functions. This is accomplished by
providing network operations, freight, telecoms and technical expertise, and a number of different
customer-focussed services to regional customers and other parts of our business. Route Services
includes, among other teams: commercial and procurement; supply chain operations; business
services; IT services; asset information services; and engineering services. The team oversees the
detivery of national programmes and initiatives. It focuses on the provision of services for the benefit
of passengers and also freight customers. Its work complements our Putting Passengers First
vision.

We have two network-wide directorates, System Operator and Technical Authority, and our core
professional functions, the Chief Financial Officer's directorate, Human Resources (HR), and
Communications.

System Operator takes a whole-system view of the railway and provides industry leadership in the
development of long-term network strategies and advice to funders. Its work integrates the railway
service we hope to deliver and the production of the railway timetable.

Technical Authority has network wide accountability in accordance with our Licence to Operate
and Safety Authorisation for setting and monitoring compliance with the policy, strategy and control
frameworks relating to safety, engineering, asset management, security, environment and
sustainability.

Our CFO directorate is made up of a number of functions: Group Finance, Property, Legal and
Corporate Services, Audit and Risk, Planning and Regulation, Corporate Finance and Business
Development, Corporate Commercial, and the Rail Investment Centre of Excellence. These
functions drive effective financial management and deliver the company’s legal reporting and
compliance requirements with our independent regulator - the ORR - and with third parties. They
also lead the development and delivery of the network strategy and our business plan. In addition,
the CFO directorate provides professional leadership and assurance on capital delivery affordability
and holds the business to account for delivering sustainable efficiencies.

Network Rail Infrastructure Limited

Strategic report (continued)

Our business model — How we are organised (Continued)

Human Resources (HR) leads the development and delivery of our people strategy and policies
across the business. It works with the regions and functions, according to need and demand, to
provide professional HR leadership and services. The team also delivers strategic transformation
initiatives.

Communications is responsible for ensuring the Company presents a consistent narrative which
places our customers at the heart of everything we do. It operates a business partnering approach
with national functions and services; our devolved organisations have their own communications
teams.

Our approach to risk management

Network Rail recognizes that the effective management of risk is critical to maintaining essential
service provision and improving the experiences of passengers and freight users. Our approach to
risk management therefore balances the threats associated with our operational environment with
identifying opportunities to improve performance through careful acceptance of some risk.

The operational railway is continuously susceptible to changing environmental conditions. The
success of the railways in the UK, measured by the growth in passenger numbers, and the
continued drive for efficiency mean that we must be both flexible and innovative in our risk mitigation
strategies. Our enterprise approach to risk management provides the opportunity to review, monitor
and enhance mitigations depending on the changing conditions and challenges.

Embedded risk management processes

We have an enterprise risk management (ERM) framework in place for the identification, analysis,
management and reporting of all risks to strategic objectives. Our ERM framework supports all areas
of the business to recognise both threats and opportunities early. Early recognition of risk allows us
to work collaboratively and proactively with customers, stakeholders and suppliers to manage our
extensive portfolio of work better.

industry risk: Collaborative risk management means we are better able to understand and manage
the interdependencies, threats and opportunities that we face collectively as an industry.

Last year (2022/23) we introduced risk categories to identify when a strategic risk could impact on
passengers, the wider industry, or third parties.

o Category A Criteria

o Direct impact on the passengers and freight users.

co Arisk to the successful delivery of a U.K. rail strategic objective.

o Arisk that is likely to require more than one U.K. rail stakeholder or 3rd party input.
o Category B Criteria

Direct impact on a Network Rail strategic objective.
o A risk which would impact on Network Rail’s mitigation activity identified in a
Category A industry risk.

fe]

o Category C Criteria

Enterprise-wide impact on normal business operations.

o Arisk to Network Rail which would not result in a direct impact to passengers and
freight users

Network Rail Infrastructure Limited

Strategic report (continued)

Our approach to risk management (continued)

* Tools & technology: Network Rail uses a suite of standardised tools to ensure consistency
across our enterprise-wide approach. A standard risk assessment matrix and defined risk
appetite enables integration of operational and strategic risks. Line of sight and links
between risks are documented and visualised through our award-winning risk visualisation
approach.

* Oversight: Whilst the ultimate responsibility for risk management rests with the Board, it
delegates the more detailed oversight of risk management and internal control principally to
the audit and risk committee, which reports the findings of its reviews to the Board. The
audit and risk committee receives regular reports from the internal and independent auditors
and reviews progress against agreed action plans to manage identified risks. Detailed
oversight of safety-related risks is delegated to the safety, health and environment
committee.

This level of oversight is underpinned by the business assurance committee process (BAC),
which operates at three levels in the organisation; the purpose of these forums being to act
as a mechanism for leadership teams to govern the management of risk within their
function, as well as escalating risks that cannot be managed tocally or have wider impact.
Each risk is assigned an owner, with the most significant risks (LO risks) each owned by a
member of the executive leadership team.

Financial risk management

Disclosures relating to the group's use of financial instruments, financial risk management objectives
and policies of the company, including its policy for hedging each major type of forecasted
transaction for which hedge accounting is used; its exposure to price risk, credit risk, liquidity risk
and cash flow risk can be found under note 25.

Network Rail has defined its risk appetite as follows;

Network Rail has no appetite for safety, health or environmental risk exposure that could result in
serious injury or loss of life to public, passengers and workforce or irreversible environmental
damage. Safety, health and environment drives all major decisions in the organisation. Network Rail
will consider options to reduce risk where the business case goes considerably beyond our legal
obligation to reduce risk so far as is reasonably practicable.

In the pursuit of its objectives, Network Rail is willing to accept, in some circumstances, risks that
have high potential for positive return but may result in some financial loss or exposure including a
small chance of breach of funding provision as set out in the business plan. It will not pursue
additional income generating or cost saving initiatives unless returns are probable (85 per cent
confidence interval (Cl) for income and 60 per cent Cl for cost reductions where potential returns are
high). . .

Where trade-offs are required in order to prioritise service provision the company will tolerate low to
moderate gross exposure to delivery of operational performance targets including network reliability,
capacity, asset condition, breakdown in information systems or information integrity. Climate change
will lead to a more difficult operating environment, but this will be responded to within plans leading
to acceptable levels of impact on overall delivery and asset reliability.

OFFICIAL

Network Rail Infrastructure Limited

Strategic report (continued)

Directors’ statement, section 172 of the Companies Act (2006)

The company wants to be seen to be best in class and respected across the industry. It will only
tolerate low to moderate exposure that may result in short term negative impact on reputation and
stakeholder relationships and is easily recoverable, i.e., minimal negative local or industry media
coverage, and/or minor employee experience and political impact. This should be balanced by
regular positive media coverage at national and local level.

As Network Rail’s board of directors, we have collectively and individually we fulfilled our duties, as
set out in section 172 of the Companies Act (2006), to a high standard throughout this reporting
period.

Acting fairly between our stakeholders

We focussed on promoting the success of the business and benefiting all our stakeholders. As a
publicly owned, not-for dividend company, our activities and engagement are concentrated on
delivering our strategy and the needs of our member (the Secretary of State for Transport), our
passengers, our people, the general public, our supply chains, the train operators, and our regulator.

High standards of business conduct

Our governance and decision-making arrangements ensure we manage the business responsibly
and effectively and to high standards of business conduct. This includes operating within the
requirements of our licence, relevant legislation and regulations, as well as understanding our
responsibilities to spend public funds efficiently and manage risks effectively. We also have a series
of policies and guidance setting out expected standards of behaviour and conduct. Our policies
include Anti-bribery policy, Anti-slavery and human trafficking policy, Code of business ethics, Speak
out (whistleblowing) policy.

We have established a committee structure to which we delegate detailed scrutiny of key areas of
our responsibilities. We have ensured our Board has the right range and depth of knowledge, skills
and experiences to run the business effectively; we refreshed our Board membership, in line with
best practice, so these remained relevant and up to date (the biographies of our directors

are included in the Network Rail Limited Group Annual Report on pages 108 to 112. At the date of
this report 9 per cent of our Board members are women. However, we understand the benefits of
diversity and are continually seeking to improve it across our Board and executive membership. In a
company as large as Network Rail, we partly fulfit our duties by delegating day-to-day decisions to
company employees within our governance framework.

Likely consequences of decisions in the long term

We developed our strategy in consultation with our stakeholders, to improve the services we provide
to our passengers, freight users, suppliers, customers and communities, and our people. Its six core
themes represent the kind of business we want to be and the kind of experiences we want our
stakeholders to have when they interact with us. Each theme is being developed by the national
strategy committee which will inform and advise the Board of the likely consequences of decisions
over the long term.

interests of the company’s employees

The re-organisation of the business under Putting Passengers First has involved significant changes
in our structure. We have implemented a series of national consultation briefings with teams,
individuals, and their trade union representatives. We have continued the Your Voice surveys, the
listening programme, and business briefings. We have also consulted our frontline track workers in
developing an improved safety culture through the safety task force.

Impact of operations on the community and the environment

In October 2019 we established the environmental sustainability advisory committee to review those
of our activities which affect the environment and the consequential impact for the general public
and local communities. We also revised the terms of reference for our safety, health and
environment committee to ensure we meet our responsibilities for complying with environmental
legislation and regulations.

Fostering business relationships with suppliers, customers and others

During the year we developed initiatives to make us more dependable and easier to work with by
working smarter with our supply chain and involving them earlier in the planning phase to help us
deliver work more efficiently. These initiatives include early contractor involvement, work bank
planning and improved contracting strategies.

Approved by the board of directors and signed on behalf of the board.

Conclusions relating to going concern

In auditing the financial statements, | have concluded that Network Rail Infrastructure Limited and its
Group’s use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements
is appropriate.

My evaluation of the director's assessment of the entity's ability to continue to adopt the going
concern basis of accounting included evaluation of management's assessment of:

« future cash requirements

* future income streams

« debt funding arrangements

* potential legislative changes

* the impact of ongoing work to implement the recommendations of the Plan for Rail.

Based on the work | have performed, | have not identified any material uncertainties relating to
events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on Network Rail
Infrastructure Limited and its group's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least
twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

My responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are
described in the relevant sections of this report.

Other Information

The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report but does not include
the financial statements and my auditor's report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other
information.

My opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the
extent otherwise explicitly stated in my report, | do not express any form of assurance conclusion
thereon.

My responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other
information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the
audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

if lidentify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, | am required to
determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves.
If, based on the work | have performed, | conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other
information, | am required to report that fact.

| have nothing to report in this regard.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In my opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

« the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year
for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements;
and

e the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal
requirements.

Matters on which | report by exception

In the light of the knowledge and understanding of Network Rail Infrastructure Limited and its Group
and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, | have not identified material misstatements
in the Strategic Report or the Directors’ Report.

| have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act
2006 requires me to report to you if, in my opinion:

adequate accounting records have not been kept or returns adequate for my audit have not
been received from branches not visited by my staff;

the financial statements to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and
returns;

certain disclosures of director's remuneration specified by law are not made;
| have not received all of the information and explanations | require for my audit; or

a corporate governance statement has not been prepared by the parent company.

Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements

As explained more fully in the Directors’ Statement of Responsibilities, the directors are responsible

for:

maintaining proper accounting records;

providing the C&AG with access to all information of which management is aware that is
relevant to the preparation of the financial statements such as records, documentation and
other matters;

providing the C&AG with additional information and explanations needed for his audit;

providing the C&AG with unrestricted access to persons within Network Rail Infrastructure
Limited from whom the auditor determines it necessary to obtain audit evidence.

preparing Group financial statements, which give a true and fair view, in accordance with the
Companies Act 2006;

ensuring such internat controls are in place as directors determine are necessary to enable
the preparation of financial statement to be free from material misstatement, whether due to

Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

My responsibility is to audit and report on the financial statements in accordance with the applicable
law and International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)).

My objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue a report that
includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that
an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it

exists.

Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the
- ‘aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken

on the basis of these financial statements.

Extent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting non-compliance with laws and regulations
including fraud

| design procedures in line with my responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements
in respect of non-compliance with laws and regulations, including fraud. The extent to which my
procedures are capable of detecting non-compliance with laws and regulations, including fraud is
detailed below.

Identifying and assessing potential risks related to non-compliance with laws and regulations, including
fraud

In identifying and assessing risks of material misstatement in respect of non-compliance with laws
and regulations, including fraud, I:
e considered the nature of the sector, control environment and operational performance
including the design of Network Rail infrastructure Limited and its Group's accounting
policies, key performance indicators and performance incentives.

e inquired of management, Network Rail Infrastructure Limited’s head of internal audit and
those charged with governance, including obtaining and reviewing supporting
documentation relating to Network Rail Infrastructure Limited and its Group’s policies and
procedures on:

o identifying, evaluating and complying with laws and regulations;
o detecting and responding to the risks of fraud; and

othe internal controls established to mitigate risks related to fraud or non-compliance
with laws and regulations including Network Rail Infrastructure Limited and its
Group’s controls relating to Network Rail Infrastructure Limited’s compliance with
the Companies Act 2006, the Network Licence and Managing Public Money;

e inquired of management, Network Rail Infrastructure Limited’s head of internal audit and
those charged with governance whether:

o they were aware of any instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations; and
o they had knowledge of any actual, suspected, or alleged fraud;

e discussed with the engagement team including significant component audit teams and the
relevant internal and external specialists, including internal IT auditors and external pension
specialists regarding how and where fraud might occur in the financial statements and any
potential indicators of fraud.

As a result of these procedures, | considered the opportunities and incentives that may exist within
Network Rail Infrastructure Limited and its Group for fraud and identified the greatest potential for
fraud in the following areas: revenue recognition, posting of unusual journals, complex transactions,
bias in management estimates. In common with all audits under ISAs (UK), | am also required to
perform specific procedures to respond to the risk of management override.

| obtained an understanding of Network Rail Infrastructure Limited and its Group's framework of
authority and other legal and regulatory frameworks in which Network Rail Infrastructure Limited and
its Group operates. | focused on those laws and regulations that had a direct effect on material
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements or that had a fundamental effect on the
operations of Network Rail Infrastructure Limited and its Group.

The key laws and regulations | considered in this context included Companies Act 2006, Managing
Public Money, employment law, pensions legislation, tax legislation, and health and safety law.

Audit response to identified risk
To respond to the identified risks resulting from the above procedures:

15

OFFICIAL

Network Rail Infrastructure Limited

e reviewed the financial statement disclosures and testing to supporting documentation to
assess compliance with provisions of relevant laws and regulations described above as
having direct effect on the financial statements;

e enquired of management, the Audit and Risk Committee and in-house legal counsel
concerning actual and potential litigation and claims;

e reviewed minutes of meetings of those charged with governance and the Board and
internal audit reports;

e in addressing the risk of fraud through management override of controls, | tested the
appropriateness of journal entries and other adjustments; assessed whether the judgements
on estimates are indicative of a potential bias; and evaluated the business rationale of any
significant transactions that are unusual or outside the normal course of business; and

e reviewing Office of Rail and Road notifications in case of any regulatory action.

| communicated relevant identified laws and regulations and potential risks of fraud to all
engagement team members including internal specialists and significant component audit teams and
remained alert to any indications of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations throughout
the audit.

A further description of my responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the
Financial Reporting Council’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description

forms part of my report.

Other auditor's responsibilities

| am required to obtain evidence sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the expenditure and
income recorded in the financial statements have been applied to the purposes intended by
Parliament and the financial transactions recorded in the financial statements conform to the
authorities which govern them.

| communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned
scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in
internal control | identify during my audit.

The company registration number is 2904587. The company’s registered office is situated at Waterloo General

2. Material accounting policies

Basis of accounting

The financial statements of Network Rail Infrastructure Limited have been prepared in accordance with UK-
adopted International Accounting Standards and with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 as
applicable to companies reporting under those standards.

The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of the rail
network to a fair, the revaluation of investment properties, the measurement of certain financial assets and
liabilities at fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL) and the measurement of derivative financial instruments
at fair value.

The material accounting policies adopted by the directors are set out below.

Functional and presentation currency

The financial statements are presented in Pound Sterling (£) which is the functional and presentation currency
of Network Rail Infrastructure Limited. All values are rounded to the nearest million pounds (£m) unless
otherwise stated.

Adoption of new and revised standards

The accounting policies adopted in this set of financial statements are consistent with those set out in the
annual financial statements for the year to 31 March 2023.

At the date of authorisation of these consolidated financial statements, several new, but not yet effective,
Standards and amendments to existing Standards, and Interpretations have been published by the [ASB or
IFRIC. None of these Standards or amendments to existing Standards have been adopted early by the Group
and no Interpretations have been issued that are applicable and need to be taken into consideration by the
Group at either reporting date.

Management anticipates that all relevant pronouncements wiil be adopted for the first period beginning on or
after the effective date of the pronouncement. New Standards, amendments and Interpretations not adopted in
the current year have not been disclosed as they are not expected to have a material impact on the Group's
consolidated financial statements.

The following accounting standard has not been early adopted by the company but will become effective in
future years:

2. Material accounting policies (continued)

IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts

IFRS 17 issued in May 2018, establishes the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and
disclosure of insurance contracts within the scope of the Standard. It introduces a new comprehensive model
(general model) for the recognition and measurement of liabilities arising from insurance contracts.

In addition, it includes a simplified approach and modifications to the general measurement model that can be
applied in certain circumstances and to specific contracts such as reinsurance contracts, direct participating
contract and investment contracts with discretionary participation features.

IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts is effective for years beginning on or after 1 January 2023 with restated
comparatives. The impact on the prior year comparatives is £1.3m and prior year comparatives have not been
adjusted as it is not considered material.

Business segments

No segmental analysis is provided because the group operates one class of business; that of managing the
national rail infrastructure and undertakes that class of business in one geographical segment, Great Britain.

Going concern

The directors took into account the publication of the Plan for Rail Review and its plans to reform the rail
industry. This proposes that a new public body, Great British Railways, will integrate the railways, owning the
infrastructure, collecting fare revenue, running, and planning the network, and setting most fares and
timetables. It is planned that Network Rail will be absorbed into the public body to bring about single, unified,
and accountable leadership for the national network. At this stage it is not likely that this reform will involve the
winding up of Network Rail Limited but in any event Great British Railways will assume the existing functions of
Network Rail Limited as well as have a wider range of powers and functions. The transformation programme is
dependent on further activities including legislation and will take time to fully deliver.

Additionally in February 2024 the draft Rail Reform Bill was published which seeks to provide for there to be an
Integrated Rail Body (IRB) — Great British Railways.

The group has considerable financial resources together with long-term contracts with a number of customers
and suppliers. Network Rail does not expect to undertake any new borrowing in the next 12 months. Instead, its
activities will be largely funded by grants from the Department for Transport (DfT) and revenue from customers.
Network Rail Infrastructure Limited has secured a £32.3bn loan facility with the DfT, which it intends to draw
upon to specifically refinance its existing debt. This facility remains within its parameters.

NRIL has eight separate grant agreements in place with DfT and Transport Scotland (TS) to fund activities in
the next 12 months. These grants are: with DfT - Network Grant; Enhancements Grant; British Transport Police
Grant; Financing Costs Grant for DfT interest; Financing Costs Grant for external interest (bonds and swaps);
and Corporation Tax Grant - with TS - Network Grant and Enhancements Grant. In addition, the work NRIL
does on behalf of Great British Railways Transition Team is recharged to GBRTT which has a separate grant
agreement with DfT.

Business plans and financial models are used to project cash flows and monitor financial risks and fiquidity
positions, forecast future funding requirements and other key financial ratios, including those relevant to our
network licence. Analysis is undertaken to understand the resilience of the group and its business model to the
potential impact of the group’s principal risks, or a combination of those risks. This analysis takes account of the
availability and effectiveness of the mitigating actions that could realistically be taken to avoid or reduce the
impact or occurrence of the underlying risks. The board considers the likely effectiveness of such actions
through regular monitoring and review of risk management and internal control systems.

In addition, Note 25 to the accounts includes the group's objectives, policies and processes for managing its
capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its financial instruments and hedging activities; and
its exposures to credit, liquidity and foreign exchange risk.

After making enquiries, including those detailed above, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the
company and the group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable
future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual report and accounts.

Basis of consolidation

Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the group has control. NRIF is
consolidated on the basis of control despite not being owned by the group. The group controls an entity when
the group is exposed to or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability
to affect those returns through its power over the entity / to direct the activities of the entity. Transactions with
non-controlling interests that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. In terms
of subsidiaries the group:

* Consolidates subsidiaries from the date on which control passes to the group and deconsolidates from the
date contro! ceases.

+ Changes the accounting policies of subsidiaries, where necessary, to ensure consistency with the policies
adopted by the group.

+ Eliminates intercompany transactions and balances in the group results.

Revenue recognition

The group recognises revenue from the following major sources:

Revenue stream Recognition

Recognised in line with costs incurred
+ Grant income that the grant is provided to cover -
See “Grants” accounting policy.

+ Franchised network access Recognised as access is provided to
» Freight revenue run trains.
+ Other income

Recognised in accordance with the

* Property rental income provision of the property.

Franchised network access and Freight Revenue
Network Rail earn income from providing access to Train Operating Companies (TOCs) and Freight Operating
Companies (FOCs) to run trains on the network.

Performance obligations for the running of the trains are based upon fixed and variable volume access to the
railway during the relevant year. Performance obligations are satisfied by providing track access over time as
per agreement with the TOCs and FOCs. There are no significant judgments applied to determine whether
performance obligations have been satisfied because it is readily apparent whether the train has run or not.

Revenue is measured based on consideration specified in a contract with the TOC or FOC. The amounts
recognised take account of any performance penalties or bonuses in respect of the year. The performance
penalties and bonuses are estimated in each four-week period based on that period’s performance and reflect
management's best estimate of the amounts due.

Property rental income

Fixed rental income from property leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant
lease. Contingent rent is recognised as earned.

NRIL receives grant funding as a contribution towards both its revenue and capital expenditure.

Revenue Grants arise from the deeds of grant agreed at the start of each control period. They are received as a

contribution towards NRIL’s running costs and are recognised across the control period to match the
expenditure to which they relate. Grants can be drawn down flexibly to meet our working capital requirements.

To the extent that they are drawn in advance of expenditure, to meet temporary working capital requirements,
then they are deferred until that expenditure is incurred. The deferred income is then released to profit/loss as

the related expenditure is incurred. Grants drawn to meet working capital movements that are not considered to be
temporary in nature are recognised in revenue.

2. Material accounting policies (continued)
Grants

NRIL funds its renewals programme through its net cash generated from operations, which is the net of cash
received or spent on operations and includes revenue grants. The assets constructed under the renewals
programme meet the definition of Property Plant and Equipment and are capitalised as additions in the year.

It is noted that determination of charges undertaken by the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) sets track access
charges after taking into account government grants. Part of the determination of charges includes an
allowance for the amortisation of the Regulatory Asset Base (RAB). This allows the funding of renewals of the
railway network in a financially sustainable manner. Currently the value of RAB amortisation is equal to the
renewals incurred in the year. The RAB is used to underpin the valuation of the railway. The valuation
movement in the year is reflected in the revaluation reserve. The revaluation reserve is reduced by the
difference between RAB amortisation (which our revenue covers as described above) and PPE depreciation
reflected in our operating costs.

Capital Grants are received as contributions towards the cost of property, plant and equipment from DfT, TS
and third parties. NRIL draws down Capital Grants from DfT and TS based on historical costs incurred in order
to meet future forecasts cash flows. Third Parties are invoiced for capital grants either in advance or arrears
based on individual grant agreements. Capital Grants are recognised in the same period as the additions they
are intended to fund and are deducted from the cost of those assets. Capital grants are then credited to the
income statement over the economic useful life of the rail network as the related costs are recognised.

Leases

The group as lessor

The group assesses leases where it is lessor in order to determine whether the lease is an operating lease ora
finance lease. This assessment is made where the group owns the asset being leased or the group itself is also
leasing the asset and hence the lease being assessed is a sub-lease. The assessment considers whether the
lease transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the asset being leased.
Where the lease is a sub-lease, this assessment is made by reference to the Right of Use asset the group has
for the head-lease. If the lease transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership, then
the lease is classified as a finance lease. If it does not, then the lease is classified as an operating lease.

Rental income from operating leases and initial direct costs are recognised on a straight-line basis over the
term of the relevant lease.

The group as lessee

For all leases other than those of less than 12 months or low value, the Right Of Use (ROU) asset and Lease
liability are initially measured on a present value basis.

The present value of the following lease payments is used to determine the value of the lease liability:

+ fixed payments less any lease incentive receivable

+ variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate

* amounts expected to be payable by the Group under residual value guarantees

+ the exercise price of a purchase option if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option

* payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising that option.

The lease liability is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Remeasurement of the lease {iability occurs if there is a change in the lease payments (when a corresponding
adjustment is made to the ROU asset), the lease term or in the assessment of an option to purchase the
underlying asset.

The discount rate used to discount the lease payments is the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. This is the

rate that the group would have to pay to borrow similar funds to fund a similar asset. ROU assets are initially
measured at the same amount as the lease {iability plus any initial direct costs.

The group as lessee (continued)

Each ROU asset is depreciated over the shorter of its useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis.
Payments associated with short-term leases and low value leases are recognised on a straight-line basis as an
expense in profit or loss.

The company is responsible for infrastructure works from the supply chain, rather than the right to use specific
assets. As a result of this, most supply chain assets are generally not ‘identified’ within the meaning of IFRS 16.
As a result, the company does not generally retain the rights to direct the how and for what purpose specific
assets are used

Foreign currencies

Monetary assets and liabilities expressed in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the exchange rates
prevailing at the balance sheet date. Foreign currency transaction amounts are initially recorded at the
exchange rates prevailing on the dates of the transactions. Gains and losses arising on retranslation are
included in the income statement for the period and are classified as either operating or financing depending on
the nature of the monetary item giving rise to them.

Borrowing costs
All borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.

Operating profit

Operating profit is stated before finance income, finance costs, other gains and losses, and revaluation
movements and profits on disposal of properties.

Retirement benefit costs

Payments to the defined contribution retirement benefit scheme are charged as an expense as they fall due.
For the defined benefit schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit
method, with full actuarial valuations being carried out at least every three years and updates to these
valuations carried out in intervening years. The current service cost and plan administration expenses are
recognised as an operating expense in the consolidated income statement.

The group’s share of the actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
They are recognised outside the income statement and presented in the statement of comprehensive income.

The net interest cost is the charge in the year on the net defined benefit liability. The charge reflects the
passage of time and is recognised as a finance cost in the income statement.

Past service cost and credits are recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement.

The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined
benefit obligation, as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme
assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of
available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.

The group reflects its share of the surplus and deficit in the financial statements. The IAS 19 deficit, service cost
and interest cost therefore represent 60 per cent of the total for each of the schemes.

During the year, the RPS Section has moved into a £82m surplus. The group has considered the scheme rules
and concluded we have an unconditional right to the return of surplus assets in the RPS scheme and hence
have recognised the surplus. The basis for this judgement is that Network Rail are able to veto any proposed
utilisation of the surplus and the Trustees cannot unilaterally wind up the scheme. If in the event of a wind up of
the scheme, there are no beneficiaries remaining, then the surpius would be returned to Network Rail. While it
is considered extremely unlikely that Network Rail would veto any use of the surplus until such time that no
beneficiaries are alive, the result is nonetheless that Network Rail have an unconditional right of the surplus in
line with the accounting recognition requirements of IFRIC 14.

Retirement benefit costs (continued)

Further details on the retirement benefit schemes are provided in note 26.

Research and development

Research and general development expenditure is charged to the income statement as incurred. Expenditure
on the development of specific projects is capitalised only if all of the following conditions are met:

+ an asset is created that can be identified
+ it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits

+ the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.

Tax

The tax expense represents the sum of the current tax and deferred tax. The group’s current tax liability is
calculated using the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date
Current tax is based on the taxable results of the group and calculated in accordance with tax rules in the
United Kingdom.

Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on the temporary differences that arise when tax
authorities recognise and measure assets and liabilities with rules that differ from those of the consolidated
accounts. Deferred tax is calculated under the balance sheet liability method at the rate of tax expected to
prevail, subject to the rate being enacted or substantively enacted by that date, when the temporary differences
reverse. Deferred tax is not discounted

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are recognised
on all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that there will be taxable profits available
against which the temporary timing differences can be utilised.

Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement except when it relates to items charged or credited
directly to equity. In this case the deferred tax is also accounted for within equity.

Property, plant and equipment — the rail network

The group has one class of property, plant and equipment, being the rail network. This is the integrated
network that the group uses to deliver the operation, maintenance and renewal of Great Britain's national rail
infrastructure.

Valuation methodology

The rail network is carried in the balance sheet at its fair value. As there is no active market in railway
infrastructure assets, the company has derived the fair value of the rail network using an income approach. The
income approach assesses the discounted future cash flows that are expected to be generated by the rail
network, including an assessment of under and out performance against the current five-year regulatory
determination. The assessment at this year end includes a review of performance for CP7.

This valuation is carried out twice a year and revaluation gains and losses are reflected in other comprehensive
income in the Revaluation Reserve.

Depreciation

The rail network is depreciated on a straight-line basis over its estimated weighted average remaining useful
economic life. The estimated weighted average remaining useful economic life of the network is currently 40
years (2023: 40 years). The remaining useful economic lives of network assets are estimated annually, with
external verification of the valuation and asset lives carried out where required.

Capitalisation of operating costs
In line with IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment, all directly attributable costs necessary to deliver the investment
programme are capitalised. Employee and other associated costs are capitalised if they arise directly as a result of

delivering the investment programme.

Presentation of capital grants

Grants and other contributions received towards the cost of property, plant and equipment are deducted from the
fair value of assets which the grant funding relates to. See Note 11. Property, plant and equipment — the rail
network for detail of the gross and net values of capital grants included in the property, plant and equipment

balance.

Investment property

Investment property, which is property held to earn rentals and/or for capital appreciation, is stated at its fair
value at the balance sheet date. Gains and losses from changes in the fair value of investment property are
included in the income statement for the period in which they arise.

Intangible assets

An intangible asset is only recognised if it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the group and its
costs can be measured reliably. Intangible assets are measured initially at purchase cost and are amortised on
a straight-line basis. Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing
the asset to its working condition for its intended use. Licences and concessions are amortised over the length
of their contractual agreement. Intangible assets are tested for impairment at each balance sheet date by
comparing their carrying value and the expected discounted cash flows expected to arise from them over their
contractual agreements. If the carrying value exceeds the discounted cash flows expected to arise from the
assets, the carrying value would be impaired accordingly.

Assets held for sale
Non-current assets are classified as held for sale if it is highly probable that they will be recovered primarily
through sale or distribution rather than through continuing use.

Immediately before classification as held for sale, the assets are re-measured in accordance with the
accounting policies for the asset category. Subsequently, the assets are held at the lower of carrying value and
fair value less costs to sell. Any impairment loss on a disposal group is recognised immediately in the income
statement.

Inventories

inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials, direct
labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location
and condition. Cost is calculated using the weighted average method.

Financial instruments

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the group's balance sheet when the group becomes
party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

Financial assets

Financial assets at amortised cost

Financial assets are classified as at amortised cost where the business model is to hold assets in order to
collect contractual cash flows, and the cash flows consist solely of payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on
the principal amount outstanding.

Financial assets at amortised cost
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate
allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts, recognised in the income statement.

2. Material accounting policies (continued)

Financial assets at Fair Value Through Profit and Loss (FVTPL)

Financial assets are classified as at FVTPL where the asset does not meet the amortised cost criteria or if
doing so, eliminates or significantly reduces or eliminates a measurement or recognition inconsistency. Gains
and losses arising from changes in fair value of these assets are recognised in the income statement.

Impairment of financial assets

Financial assets, other than those at FVTPL, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet
date. Financial assets at FVTPL are stated at fair value with any resultant gain or loss recognised in the income
statement. Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more
events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the
investment have been reduced.

The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss for all financial assets with the
exception of trade receivables, which are reduced by allowances for irrecoverable amounts. As financial assets,
trade receivables are subject to the “Expected Credit Loss model” under IFRS 9. The group’s exposure to credit
tisk is limited largely to property rental income, and no significant increase in credit risk has materialised.
Therefore, the group has continued to recognise 12 month expected losses that are updated at each reporting
date, in the form of allowances for irrecoverable amounts, which approximate the expected losses for the next
12-month period.

If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related
objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment
loss is reversed through the income statement. The reversal is only made to the extent that the carrying amount
of the investment at the date the impairment is reversed does not exceed what the amortised cost would have
been had the impairment not been recognised.

Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise bank balances held by the group and commercial paper at varying rates.
The carrying amount of these assets approximates their fair value.

Joint ventures

The results and net assets of joint ventures are incorporated in the group financial statements using the equity
method of accounting. Investments in joint ventures are carried in the balance sheet at cost and adjusted by
post-acquisition changes in the group’s share of net assets of joint ventures, less any impairment in the value of
individual investments. Losses of a joint venture in excess of the group’s interest in a joint venture are not
recognised.

Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.

Financial liabilities at Fair Value Through Profit and Loss (FVTPL)
Financial liabilities are classified as at FVTPL where the financial liability is a derivative financial liability or
designated at FVTPL at initial recognition.

A financial liability is designated as FVTPL upon initial recognition if such designation eliminates or significantly
teduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise exist.

The group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the group's obligations are discharged,
cancelled or expire.

2. Material accounting policies (continued)
Debt

Debt instruments not designated at FVTPL are initially measured at fair value, net of discount and direct issue
costs, and subsequently recognised at amortised cost using straight line amortisation as a proxy for the IFRS 9
effective interest rate method. Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and
direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis to the income statement using the effective interest
rate method, and are added to the carrying value of the debt instrument to the extent that they are not settled in
the period in which they arise.

Certain bonds, as set out in Note 18, are designated at FVTPL. These bonds are hedged by derivative financial
instruments as part of a documented risk management strategy. By recognising these bonds and derivatives at
FVTPL the recognition inconsistencies that would otherwise exist with regard to these risk management
strategies are significantly reduced.

Intra-group borrowings — Network Rail Infrastructure Finance (NRIF) provides the Network Rail group with
funding and passes all transactions and balances through the intra-group borrowings to NRIL. Existing debt,
derivatives and related interest payments within NRIF are passed onto NRIL in the form of an intercompany
loan.

Trade payables

Trade payables are ordinarily not interest bearing and are stated at amortised cost.

Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting

The group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in interest rates and foreign currency
exchange rates. The group has previously issued interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps and foreign
exchange forward contracts to hedge these exposures. The use of financial derivatives is governed by the
group's policies approved by the treasury committee of the board, which provide written principles on the use of
financial derivatives.

All the hedged events have now occurred and there will be no new hedging programme.

Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are
subsequently remeasured to their fair value at each balance sheet date. Derivatives are presented on the
balance sheet in line with their maturity date.

The group designates certain derivatives as hedging instruments - either cash flow hedges or fair value hedges.
At the inception of the hedge relationship, the entity documents the relationship between the hedging
instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking
various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the group
documents whether the hedging instrument that is used in a hedging relationship is highly effective in offsetting
changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged item.

Some derivatives, while complying with the group's financial risk management policies, do not qualify for hedge
accounting and are therefore classified as financial instruments at FVTPL. Changes in the fair value of
derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for cash flow hedge accounting are recognised in the income
statement as they arise.

Cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires, is sold, terminated,
exercised or no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting. The latter case occurs most often in practice,
principally when the hedged event has occurred, terminating the economic relationship between the derivative
and the hedged item. In such cases the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument that remains in
equity from the period where the hedge was effective (i.e. the hedging reserve balance) is amortised from to
profit and oss in line with the periods in which the hedged cash flows — predominantly finance costs in respect
of hedged debt issuances - affect profit and loss. The amortisation is included in finance costs.

In cases where the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, or an irrecoverable loss is assessed to
have occurred, the hedging reserve balance is immediately recognised in the income statement.

Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting (continued)

Cumulative losses in the hedging reserve following the passage of a hedged event, such as hedging the rate at
which debt is issued using interest rate swaps, are offset by a favourable financial effect from correspondingly
lower cash flows arising on interest from the issued debt.

Embedded derivatives within a financial asset host contract are not separated from the host contract, instead,
the whole contract in its entirety is accounted for as a single financial instrument.

Embedded derivatives within a host contract that is a financial liability are separated from the host contract and
accounted for as a derivative financial instrument when economic characteristics of the embedded derivative
and host are not closely related, an identical instrument (with the same terms) would meet the definition of a
derivative, and the entire contract is not measured at fair value through profit or loss. Gains or losses from the
movement in fair value of the financial instrument are reported in the income statement. There are no separated
embedded derivatives included in the financial statements.

Note 19 sets out details of the fair values of the derivative instruments used for hedging purposes. Movements
in the hedging reserve in equity are detailed in the statements of changes in equity and in the statements of
comprehensive income.

Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is
probable that the group will be required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the directors’ best
estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date and are discounted to
present value where the effect is material.

Critical accounting judgements and key sources of uncertainty

(i) Property, plant and equipment — the rail network: the estimate of the fair value of the rail network is based
on an income approach using the regulatory asset base, which equates to the discounted future cash flows
associated with the network, adjusted for the net present value of any variances from the Office of Rait and
Road's determination using the building block model of regulation. Management have assessed the valuation
methodology considering the ORR's Final Determination and have concluded that it remains appropriate.

The most significant judgement underpinning the valuation is that the regulatory framework and associated
cash flows remain sufficiently stable and robust to form the basis of a third-party valuation. Management assess
that based on the current regulatory environment, an investor could reasonably expect to recover the RAB
value through the revenue deriving from future amortisation allowances and the regulatory return thereon. In its
assessment management has considered the amendments to the regulatory framework that are set out in the
regulator's determination for Control Period 6 (2019-2024), and noted that although the regulated asset base
has ceased to be a building block in the determination of the company’s revenue requirement, the link between
income and the regulated asset base would be reinstated in the event that the rail network asset were
transferred to a private owner. This assessment remains appropriate for Control Period 7.

In addition, recent disposals from the railway network have been in fine with the carrying value. This
emphasises that the valuation approach undertaken in these accounts remains appropriate. Management have
deducted the portfolio of assets held for sale from the RAB in arriving at the fair value of the rail network.
Further detail on this and other key judgements applied in the valuation are set out in Note 11.

The key source of estimation uncertainty within the valuation is the assessment of future performance against
the regulatory determination which is discussed in more detail in Note 11. The assessment covers the expected
performance during Control Period 7.

Whilst not affecting the fair value of the asset recognised at the balance sheet date, management's assessment
of the remaining life of the asset affects the depreciation that is charged on the asset and is also an area of
estimation uncertainty. IAS 16 requires that management regularly review asset lives on at least an annual
basis and that depreciation is charged on a systematic basis that reflects the way the asset is consumed.

Critical accounting judgements and key sources of uncertainty (continued)

Network Rail produce a depreciated replacement cost (DRC) valuation of the rail network for inclusion in DfT's

group accounts.

in preparing these financial statements management reviewed the weighted average remaining asset lives as
produced in the DRC valuation and concluded that it is still appropriate to use 40 years as the weighted

average remaining life.

Cost of Work Done (COWD): The additions to Property, plant and equipment are valued using an estimate of
the cost of work done in the year to 31 March. To the extent that the COWD is greater than the invoiced
amount, a PPE addition and ‘other payable’ (Note 17) are recognised on the basis of expected amounts
required to settle contractual obligations. COWD assessments are predominantly based on information readily

available to project managers on the status of works, but some estimation uncertainty is involved in the year-

end measurement, in respect of the evaluation of how contractual dispute positions are likely to resolve, and in

measuring the value of works performed at the precise year end date.

{ii) Investment property — an element of the investment property portfolio valuation is determined using the
Beacon method. Jones Lang LaSalle provided their assessment of yields for 17 classes of property and areas
in the portfolio. These are then used to produce income multipliers and applied to the rental streams from each
of the individual properties in the portfolio to form an overall valuation. For investment property transferred to

assets held for sale this is also the inherited method of valuation. Further details are set out in Note 12.

(iii) Retirement benefit obligations — the group recognises and discloses its retirement benefit obligation in
accordance with the measurement and presentational requirement of IAS 19 (Revised) ‘Employee Benefits’.
The calculations include a number of judgements and estimations in respect of the expected rate of return on
assets, the discount rate, inflation assumptions, the rate of increase in salaries and life expectancy among
others. Changes in these assumptions can have a significant effect on the value of the retirement benefit
obligation. The key assumptions made are set out in Note 26. The total contribution rate payable under the
Railway Pension Scheme (RPS) and the Career Average Revalued Earnings (CARE) scheme is normally split
in the proportion 60:40 between the group and the members, respectively. The group reflects its share of the

contribution in the financial statements.

(iv) Taxation - the group recognises and discloses its deferred tax assets in accordance with IAS 12. Where it
is considered to be probable that deferred tax assets can be matched to future taxable profits then deferred tax
assets are recognised or offset against the overall deferred tax provision as appropriate. This evaluation
requires significant judgements to be made, including the uncertainty of the availability of future taxable profits.

Further details are set out in Note 10.

Under IAS 12 deferred tax assets can only be recognised where it is probable that taxable profits will be
available against which the deferred tax asset can be utilised. As in 2023, it remains improbable that Network
Rail will produce a level of taxable profits that will allow for recognition of a deferred tax asset relating to the
trading losses carried forward. Network Rail uses all its profits to fund capital expenditure. Management's
current assessment is that there will be no significant taxable income for the year to 31 March 2025. Beyond the
current funding regime, there is no certainty over the funding mechanism of Network Rail and hence the use of
any losses.

Deferred tax at 31 March 2024 is calculated at a rate of 25 per cent (2023: 25 per cent) based on the tax rate
expected to prevail based on legislative enactments at the point temporary differences resolve. The amount at
which temporary differences crystallise is sensitive to the decisions on future tax laws to be taken by
Parliament.

UK corporation tax is calculated at 25 per cent (2023: 19 per cent).

Given the economic and physical interdependency of the assets comprising the rail network, the company has
concluded that the rail network is considered as a single class of asset. The rail network is carried at its fair
value.

As there is no active market in railway infrastructure assets, the company has derived the fair value of the rail
network using an income approach. Under this approach the cash flows that a network licence holder expects
to generate from the rail network are assessed using a market rate of return. This valuation is carried out twice
a year and revaluation gains and losses are reflected in other comprehensive income.

The independent rail regulator, the Office of Rail and Road (ORR), has stated (in the 2018 periodic review final
determination: Supplementary document — financial framework) that a private network ticence holder of the
railway network would have its revenue requirement determined using the building block model of regulation.
Under this model the network licence holder's annual income (received in the form of the network grant and
track access charges) would comprise:

a) The regulator’s assessment of the efficient costs of operating and maintaining the network.

b) An allowance for Regulatory Asset Base (RAB) amortisation - qualifying capital expenditure is added to the
RAB as incurred and recovered by the company through future amortisation allowances (in order to spread the
cost to customers and stakeholders of investment in the rai! network over many years).

c) An allowed return on the RAB — calculated by applying the rate of return permitted by the ORR (based on its
assessment of the market's cost of capital) to the RAB balance.

11. Property, plant and equipment — the rail network (continued)

In the determination for Control Period 6 (2019-2024), published on 31 October 2018, ORR explains that from 1
April 2019 the RAB will no longer be a building block in the determination of the company’s revenue
requirement, but that the previous method of revenue determination would be restored if the rail network asset
were to be transferred to a private owner. IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement requires management to assess
fair value from the perspective of a theoretical market participant, rather than based on the value-in-use.
Accordingly, the amendments made to the regulatory framework for Contro! Period 6, which reflect the proximity
of Network Rail to the public sector, and which would not apply to a market participant, are not relevant to the
valuation.

Future cash flows under (a) are assumed to be equivalent over time to the network licence holder's actual costs
of operation and maintenance, on the basis that the Regulator aims to set targets which are ambitious but
achievable. These therefore have no net impact on forecast future cash flows, or the valuations. The allowed
return (c) is based on a cost of capital which would be offset in a discounted future cash flows model (see
Discount rate below). The economic rights inherent in ownership of the regulated rail network asset are
therefore vested primarily in the value of the RAB, which will be recovered through future regulated income as
the RAB is amortised (b).

This means that it is possible for the RAB itself to be used as the starting point for a discounted cash flow
valuation. The RAB fluctuates in valuation; increasing in value principally as a result of allowances for capital
expenditure and inflation indexation, whilst reducing for amortisation. The adjustments may give rise to upwards
or downwards revaluations. Further changes are subject to:

a) Adjustment for any difference between regulatory rate of return and the market cost of capital that a third-
party investor would use to assess the value of the network (the rate of return and market cost of capital are
currently assessed as fully aligned); and

b) Adjustment for forecast future under or out performance against the regulatory determination over the
remainder of the current control period. As this is the end of Control Period 6, this assessment has been made
for Control Period 7. No adjustment is made in respect of future control periods on the expectation of the
Regulator setting, over the jong term, ambitious but achievable determination.

When valuing the network, management is required to consider the value a knowledgeable willing party would
place on the network in an arm's length transaction. On the grounds that third party investors are known to
value the assets of regulated companies by reference to the RAB, and that the cash flows associated with the
regulatory framework are considered sufficiently stable and robust to form the basis of a third-party valuation,
management has used the RAB as the starting point for its valuation.

Revaluation

The valuation includes a £2.9bn upward movement in the value of the railway. The key drivers for the valuation

are:
The impact of indexation inflation (£3.3bn increase in the valuation) offset by,
£250m adverse impact of expected performance.
The valuation at 31 March 2023 was reduced by £1.7bn reflecting the impact of the sharp increase in
the cost. of borrowing in the year (and since the regulatory WACC was determined in late 2018) and
more importantly the impact this change might have on notional buyers of the railway network. In the
current year, the real weighted average cost of capital (and therefore the rate of return allowed on the
RAB) has been assessed by the ORR for the period from 1%' April 2024 to 31 March 2029 at 3.98%
compared with the prior real CP6 rate of return at 4.15%. The real WACC as determined by the ORR
is used as a proxy for that of a notional buyer. Given the determination has indicated a real WACC for
CP7 similar to that of CP6, this indicates adequate compensation for the increased cost of borrowing
from increases in global interest rates has been included in the valuation without any further
adjustment required. Note that these returns are set at real rates and inflation is taken into account in
calculating the underlying Regulatory Asset Base. We have therefore removed the reduction in the
valuation at 31 March 2024. The removal of this adjustment increases the valuation by £1.7bn.

« The rate at which assets are amortised in the RAB and assets are depreciated under IAS 16 (£1.5bn

decrease in the valuation).

11. Property, plant and equipment — the rail network (continued)

Impact of indexation inflation
Indexation inflation was based on management's forecast for November CPI, of 3.9 per cent. This has added
£3.3bn to the valuation of the Regulatory Asset Base.

The valuation is sensitive to the CP! assumption. If CPI varied by 1%, this would result in a £0.8bn change in
the valuation of the network.

Third party funding

Additions to the railway network funded by capital grant, rather than via the RAB funding mechanism, are
included in the valuation at cost. The carrying value of property, plant and equipment is calculated after netting
off associated grant funding received or receivable.

Disposals

The disposals of £162m were as the result of property sales in the usual course of business. |n line with
Regulatory Accounting Guidelines the net proceeds of sales are deducted from the RAB, reducing the valuation
of the Railway Network Valuation. The valuation of the disposals is assessed as being equal to the reduction in
the valuation of the railway network relating to property sales. Renewals are completed at the useful life of the
asset and hence there is no value attributable to the item being renewed that needs to be derecognised from
PPE.

Depreciation

The depreciation charge for any year is calculated using the average carrying value for the year and the
estimated remaining weighted average useful economic life of the rai! network. The remaining weighted
average useful economic life of the rail network was calculated using the engineering assessment of
serviceable economic lives of the major categories that comprise the rail network. The estimated remaining
weighted average useful economic life of the network is currently 40 years (2023: 40 years).

Impairment of HS2 related works

A review of works has been taken by Network Rail in relation to HS2 following the UK Government's published
report ‘Network North: Transforming British Transport’ on 4 October 2023, which outlined significant changes to
the High Speed Two (HS2) project to include scaling back the railway to a high-speed line between London
Euston and Birmingham Curzon Street. This review has resulted in £145m of capitalised works being written off
as well as capital grants of £57m, resulting in a £88m loss to the P&L.

Reclassification of deferred capital grants

£494m of deferred capital grants were reclassified during the year from Non-current payables. The balance
relates to grants received to fund capital works and was reclassified following confirmation of the continuing
grant funding mechanism.

Discount rate

The discount rate used in the income approach is the pre-tax rate of return set by the ORR. The ORR performs
a periodic review every five years, which leads to the setting of the appropriate rate for the five-year period. The
ORR’s method encompasses advice from consultants, comparisons to similar infrastructure assets and
discussions with Network Rail. Management believes this cost of capital reflects the assumptions that a market
participant would make in arriving at a discount rate.

Should the ORR amend the permitted rate of return in future quinquennial reviews, the regulator would raise or
lower the permitted charges to customers so as to achieve the new rate of return. In other words, the cash flows
would change but the RAB would not.

The ORR confirmed that a conventionally funded market participant would receive an allowed return equal to
the full market cost of capital. This has been reiterated in their final determination for CP7. Management
expects that if the rail network asset were to be transferred to a private owner during CP7, ORR would
determine the private owner's revenue requirement for CP7 using the original pre-tax (CPI) WACC of 3.98% set
out in their final determination for this Control Period amended for the movement since then. Management
expects that the rate of return set by the regulator in subsequent quinquennial reviews will be consistent with
the market discount rates for infrastructure assets at the quinquennial review date.

Forecast performance variations

In assessing the value of the rail network, management considers that a knowledgeable willing third party would
take into account the perceived fairness and deliverability of the current regulatory determination. Accordingly,
management makes an addition (or deduction) to the valuation for its assessment of the likely ORR
determination in respect of the financial consequences of anticipated future out (or under) performance against
the regulatory determination.

Cost outturns on capital work (renewals and enhancements) have an impact on future cash flows under the
regulatory framework, since only efficient overspending in excess of regulated cost targets can be added to the
RAB.

At 31 March 2024 the valuation included £100m of projected underperformance (31 March 2023: £150m of
projected outperformance) which is expected to crystallise in the income statement over the next year. The
combined impact of the crystallisation of the £150m outperformance and the now expected £100m
underperformance is a £250m downward valuation.

Measures taken to change franchise contracts by both DfT and TS has continued to allow train operating
companies to settle amounts owed to Network Rail as they fall due.

Critical judgements

The valuation includes the following critical judgements:

a) The regulatory framework, and associated cash flows remain sufficiently stable and robust to form the basis
of a third-party valuation. As noted above, the ORR has made it clear in its final determination for CP7 that the
amendments made to the regulatory framework for CP7 reflect the proximity of Network Rail to the public sector
and the amendments would not apply to a market participant.

b) The ORR has committed to providing a market cost of capital return to a conventionally funded owner and
operator of the network and the fair value calculation has been prepared on that basis.

c) Management's assessment of the deliverability of the CP7 regulatory determination is a good indication of
how other management groups would perform against the determination .

.d) The deliverability of the current 5-year regulatory determination does not have any implication for the
deliverability of future determinations (i.e. the ambition of the regulator at the start of each Control Period is to
set the regulatory determination at a level which is challenging but achievable).

e) The RAB includes historic expenditure on the company’s investment properties. In accordance with IAS 40
investment Property and IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations the fair value
of investment property and assets held for sale is separately recognised in Notes 12 and 13 to the accounts.
The fair value of the railway network excludes the fair value of RAB-funded investment properties (and assets
held for sale) on the grounds that a private owner of the railway network would not expect to derive any future
economic benefit from the sale of investment property (i.e. the regulator would make a downwards adjustment
to the RAB for the value of any investment properties sold). The valuation performed at 31 March 2024 includes
a downwards adjustment of £204m to exclude the fair value of relevant investment property and relevant assets
held for sale (31 March 2023: £208m).

Critical judgements (continued)

f) When considering the appropriateness of the valuation methodology, the Directors took into account the
publication of the draft Rail Reform bill in February 2024 and its plans to reform the rail industry. The directors
concluded that the current methodology remained appropriate. In considering this, the directors noted that
recent disposals from the railway network have been in line with the carrying value of the railway network. This
emphasises that the valuation approach undertaken in these accounts remains appropriate.

At 31 March 2024 the group had entered into contractual commitments in respect of capital expenditure
amounting to £3,041m (2023: £3,543m).

We have classified the valuation of the rail network as Level 3 under IFRS 13.

The market values of the group’s investment properties at 31 March 2024 have been arrived at on the basis of
a valuation carried out at that date in conjunction with Jones Lang LaSalle, external valuers not connected with
the group. Network Rail undertake a detailed review of the investment property portfolio to allocate the portfolio
to beacons which represent particular groups of property sharing the same characteristics. Network Rail apply
yields provided by Jones Lang LaSalle to these beacon categories. Jones Lang LaSalle will also value specific
properties, as instructed by Network Rail.

Management are satisfied that Jones Lang LaSalle hold a recognised and relevant professional qualification,
and have had recent experience in the location and category of the investment property being valued. The fair
value of the group’s investment property portfolio is deemed to be the market value.

The valuation, which conforms to International Valuation Standards, was arrived at by splitting the portfolio
between one-off individual properties to be valued separately and the remainder of the portfolio to be valued
under the Beacon method.

Jones Lang LaSalle provided independent valuations of 21 one-off individual properties (2023: 19), amounting
to 46 per cent (2023: 46 per cent) of the total valuation. The balance of the estate was valued under the Beacon
method by splitting the portfolio into 17 homogeneous classes (2023: 17) of property and areas, assuming that
the current passing rent received from these properties are in line with market rent. Jones Lang LaSalle
independently assessed the appropriate yield to be adopted within each of these classes and areas. This
enabled the directors to estimate market values by applying the provided yields to the net rental income from
these properties, in accordance with a standard UK investment property valuation.

The property rental income earned by the group from assets categorised at the year-end as investment
property, all of which is leased out under operating leases, amounted to £14.1m (2023: £14.1m). Direct
operating expenses arising on the investment properties in the year amounted to £2.7m (2023: £2.8m).

The group’s investment properties are let on a tenant repairing basis. The group’s maintenance obligations are
limited to common areas and vacant property units .

Property valuations are by their nature subjective, as they are made on the basis of assumptions made by the
valuer. They have been classified as Level 3 and the key inputs to the valuations, defined as ‘unobservable’ by
IFRS 13, are analysed in the table below.

* The Beacon methodology splits all the properties within the portfolio into 17 homogenous groups. The properties in each group are valued by
applying a yield to the annual rent (passing or void) for the property. Yields applied are on the basis that the property is rack rented i.e. the
current passing rent received from these properties are in line with market rent. As such, an estimated rental value per square feet for these
properties is not available.

All other factors being equal, a higher yield would lead to a decrease in the valuation of a property and an
increase in the current or estimated future rental stream would have the effect of increasing the capital value,
and vice versa. However, there are interrelationships between the unobservable inputs which are influenced by
market conditions, which would impact the changes in fair value.

Trade receivables from contracts with customers, agreements with government and from the property portfolio
are all based on unconditional rights to consideration and are not contingent on conditional or dependent on

satisfying other performance obligations.

Trade receivables include an allowance for estimated irrecoverable amounts from the supply of services of
£63m (2023: £52m). This allowance has been made by reference to past default experience. Past default
experience is adjusted for forward looking information where relevant. The group and company provide fully for

receivables overdue by over six months. The group average debtor days were 55 days (2023: 63 days) and for
the company, the average debtor days were 55 days (2023: 64 days).

The directors consider that the carrying value of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value. All
balances are non-interest bearing and denominated in sterling.

The group and company’s credit risk are primarily attributable to its trade receivables. Around 97 per cent of the
group and company’s income is received from train operating companies and in the form of revenue grants
from Government. Franchises are issued to train operating companies by the Department for Transport in
England and Wales and Transport Scotland in Scotland. The group believes that amounts receivable from
Government and the train operating companies represent a high level of credit quality. This is because in the
extraordinary circumstance that a train operating company were to be unable to meet its obligations then
provisions in the franchise agreements allow the Department for Transport to take over services at any time.
Measures taken to change franchise contracts by both DfT and Transport Scotiand during the global pandemic
have allowed train operating companies to continue to settle amounts owed to Network Rail as they fall due.
Before accepting any other new customer, the company uses an external credit scoring system to assess the
potential customer's credit quality.

Included in the group and company’s trade receivable balance are amounts totalling £98m (2023: £78m) which
are past due at the reporting date for which the company has not provided as there has not been a significant
change in the credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable. The group and company do not
hold collateral over these balances. The average age of these receivables is 28 days (2023: 26 days).

The following table shows the age of financial assets for the group and company which are past due and for which no
specific provision has been raised:

17. Trade and other payables (continued)

Deferred income includes ENil (31 March 2023: £792m) relating to cumulative timing differences between
government grants received and expenditure being incurred which gives rise to the recognition of income under
grant agreements. The £792m balance was released at the end of the Control Period.

The group average credit period taken for trade purchases is 40 days (2023: 38 days). For the company, the
average credit period taken for trade purchases is 39 days (2023: 38 days).

Before accepting new suppliers, and upon letting significant contracts, the group evaluates suppliers’
creditworthiness using external credit scoring systems and other relevant data.

The directors consider that the carrying value of trade and other payables approximates to their fair value. All
balances are ordinarily non-interest bearing and denominated in sterling.

The Other accruals balances contains a degree of estimation uncertainty regarding the amounts to be paid. The
majority of the balance relates to COWD which is disclosed as a key source of estimation uncertainty.

On 4 July 2014, the Secretary of State for Transport provided the group with a loan facility of £30,875m expiring on
31 March 2019. Following the asset divestment programme, the loan facility was reduced to £29,909m which had
been fully drawn as at 31 March 2019. On 28 March 2019, a new facility was signed which became available for
drawing on 1 April 2019 (the ‘2019 facility’). The 2019 facility has a drawdown limit of £32,329m. Following an asset

disposal, this facility was reduced to £31,859m. In the prior year, the holders of certain bonds within the debt

issuance programme had the option to request repayment. As a result, the facility was increased by £444m. This
remained undrawn at 31 March 2024 as the option to request repayment of these bonds was not taken. In addition,
the Secretary of State for Transport has provided unlimited financial indemnity in respect of borrowings under the

Debt Issuance Programme which expires in 2052.

Notional amounts above reflect the contractual value reiating to the principal instrument (e.g., bond) to which
the derivative relates.

The majority of the group’s remaining derivative are forward-starting interest rate swaps which were initiated
prior to Network Rail’s reclassification. The ‘pay fixed, receive floating’ arrangement had — at hedge inception —
the effect of fixing Network Rail’s exposure to interest rate movements between the date of entering into the
swap and the drawdown of expected future debt issuances. The balance in the hedging reserve represents the
cumulative loss on these instruments at the point of debt drawdowns, less amounts reclassified into profit and
loss in line with the maturity of the hedged item (debt).

Following the passage of the hedged events (debt issuances), which have all now occurred, movements on
these instruments have been taken in full to profit and loss since the economic relationship underpinning the
hedge no longer exists. Interest rate swaps included within the derivatives population above also include
reversing swaps entered into at the point of debt drawdowns to cancel the floating leg effect of the original
swap. Movements in fair value for these reversing swaps are taken against profit and loss throughout the life of
these instruments.

The group and company have also provided against a number of claims arising from interpretations of legal
contracts or past events for which settlement is expected to be achieved in the next year but could be deferred
to future years depending on the legal interpretation of rights and responsibilities under the contracts as well as
commercial negotiation.

Provisions are measured at the directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the
balance sheet date. The nature of these claims means that there is some uncertainty with regard to the value
that they will be settled at. If the outcomes of the claims are different to the assumptions underpinning the
directors’ best estimates, then a further liability may arise.

Contingent liabilities

There are a number of uncertainties surrounding development indemnities and warranties which may affect the
Group's financial performance. Where claims are possible but not probable, or are unquantifiable, such claims
are treated as contingent liabilities. Contingent liabilities are monitored to ensure that, where a possible
obligation has become probable or a transfer of economic benefits has become probable, a provision is made.

The general nature of contingent liabilities are development indemnities and warranties.

Under IAS 12 deferred tax assets can only be recognised where it is probable that taxable profits will be
available against which the deferred tax asset can be utilised. Note 10 includes further discussion around the
recognition of deferred tax assets. The deferred tax asset on tax losses of £2,879m (2023: £2,297m) has
therefore not been recognised.

Additionally, whilst taxable income does not exceed allowable deductions in the year, Network Rail claims only
the capital allowances sufficient to make the necessary claims for group relief and available tax credits.

25. Funding and financial risk management

Introduction

The group's funding requirement is met by the Department for Transport via a toan facility and grants.
Previously, the group was almost entirely debt financed. Of the total £60.1bn borrowings, £28.2bn debt has
been issued through the special purpose financing company Network Rail Infrastructure Finance PLC, which is
not a member of the Network Rail Limited group, but is treated as a subsidiary for accounting purposes. This
debt has been issued by Network Rail Infrastructure Finance PLC under the Debt Issuance Programme which
is rated AA by Standard and Poor's, Aa3 (outlook stable) by Moody's and AA- (outlook stable) by Fitch. The
Debt Issuance Programme is supported by a financial indemnity from the Secretary of State for Transport which
expires in 2052. The remaining £31.9bn was issued to Network Rail Infrastructure Limited through the
Department for Transport (refer to Reclassification of Network Rail below).

Debt has been issued in a number of currencies and a range of maturities which gives rise to interest rate,
foreign currency and inflation risk. Financial risk management aims to mitigate these risks.

Reclassification of Network Rail

In December 2013, the Office for National Statistics announced the reclassification of Network Rail as a Central
Government Body in the UK National Accounts and Public Sector Finances with effect from 1 September 2014.
This is a statistical change driven by guidance in the European System of National Accounts 2010 (ESA10).

As part of Network Rail’s formal reclassification to the public sector, an arrangement was agreed whereby
funding would be provided by the DfT in the form of a joan made directly to Network Rail Infrastructure Limited,
to fund the continuing programme of long-term investment in the nationa! rail network. Network Rail
Infrastructure Finance PLC does not anticipate issuing further bonds in the foreseeable future and its debt
service obligations would be met through repayments of the intercompany loan by Network Rail Infrastructure
Limited.

All of the outstanding bonds under the Debt Issuance Programme, including nominal and index-linked
benchmarks and private placements in all currencies, will continue to benefit from the direct and explicit
guarantee from the UK Government under the Financial Indemnity Mechanism. In the unlikely event that the
DfT withdraws or breaches its obligations on the loan facility to Network Rail the group may issue further bonds
or commercial paper to meet funding requirements.

Summary table of financial assets and liabilities

The following table presents the carrying amounts and the fair values of the group’s financial assets and
liabilities at 31 March 2024 and 2023.

The fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are recorded at the amount at which the instrument could be
exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. The
following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values where balances were not already
held at fair value (see Accounting policies in Note 2):

Bank loans — based on market data at the balance sheet date and the net present value of discounted cash
flows.

* Bonds issued under. the Debt Issuance Programme — based on market data at the balance sheet date. There
are a small number of privately held bonds that are valued by management. Management review comparator
bonds and determine an appropriate yield rate based on similar bonds that have available prices.

Forcash and cash equivalents, investment properties, finance lease receivables, trade and other payables and
trade and other receivables, fair value equates to carrying value.

The bonds issued under the Debt issuance programme are all level 2. Financial liabilities designated at fair
value, the bank loans, the derivatives and the loan from the Department for Transport are all level 2. For all of
the remaining balances, the carrying value approximates fair value and these are level 3.

As shown in the above table, the bonds issued under the Debt Issuance Programme have fair values
significantly in excess of their carrying values. These differences are not reflected in the Balance Sheet since
the majority of these instruments (See Note 18) were not designated at FVPL on initial recognition and hence
are accounted for at amortised cost under IFRS 9. The size of the difference is driven by the overall decrease in
market debt yield rates since the inception of these instruments; debt terms in a higher yield environment
resulting in a settlement at par would now attract a premium, assuming no other changes to the instrument or
wider environment.

Derivatives

The group (including the group's special purpose financing company, Network Rail Infrastructure Finance PLC)
uses derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to foreign exchange risk and interest rate movements.
The group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Certain derivatives are
designated as hedges, and those derivatives that are not hedge accounted are fair valued immediately through
the income statement. The group has a comprehensive risk management process.

The board of Network Rail Limited (the ultimate parent company of NRIL) through a treasury sub-committee
(The treasury committee) have approved and monitor the risk management processes, including documented
treasury policies, counterparty limits, controlling and reporting structures.

The use of derivative instruments can give rise to credit and market risk. Market risk is the possibility that future
changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates may make a derivative more or less valuable. Since the
group uses derivatives for risk management, market risk relating to derivative instruments will principally be
offset by changes in the valuation of the underlying assets, liabilities or transactions being hedged.

25. Funding and financial risk management (continued)
Credit risk

Network Rail manages its funds with banks that have high credit ratings; assigned by international credit-rating
agencies. The treasury committee authorises the policy for setting counterparty limits based on credit ratings.
The group spreads its exposure over a number of counterparties and has strict policies on how much exposure
can be assigned to each of the counterparties. Surplus liquidity is invested in the Government Banking Scheme
which has low credit risk.

For debt designated as Fair Value Through Profit and Loss (FVTPL) there has been no change in carrying
value as a result of changes in the group’s credit risk. The gain in the income statement arising from the
remeasurement of FVTPL debt items of £4m (2023: £7m) is all attributable to changes in market risk.

The credit risk with regard to all classes of derivative financial instruments entered into before 1 January 2013 is
limited because Network Rail has arrangements in place which limit each bank to a threshold (based on credit
ratings), which if breached requires the bank to post collateral in cash or eligible securities. The members of the
banking group are required to post collateral on positive mark to market swaps above the threshold. In
December 2012 the group entered into new collateral agreements in respect of derivative trades entered into
after 1 January 2013. Under the terms of the new agreements Network Rail posts collateral on adverse net
derivative positions with its counterparties. The new agreements do not contain a provision for thresholds; as
such Network Rail or its counterparties are required to post collateral for the full fair value of net out of the
money positions. At 31 March 2024 the fair value of collateral held was £3m (2023: £2m). The group is the
beneficial owner of this collateral. The group is free to invest or otherwise utilise the collateral at its discretion,
subject to acting within the authority sanctioned by the treasury committee. The balance of collateral posted by
the group at 31 March 2024 was £85m (2023: £141m).

The group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty and has considered the
. creditworthiness of debtors. For further detail on the creditworthiness of customers and suppliers, see Notes 16
(Trade and other receivables) and 17 (Trade and other payables).

The group considers its maximum exposure to credit risk to be the sum of its financial assets, as set out on
Note 18.

Foreign exchange risk

Network Rail is exposed to currency risks from its investing, financing and operating activities. Foreign
exchange risk for all currencies is managed by the use of forward exchange contracts and currency swaps to
limit the effects of movements in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated liabilities.

The group considers a 10-percentage point increase in the value of any currency against sterling to be a
reasonably possible change and this would not have a material impact on the group's net profit before tax or
equity.

Interest rate and inflation risk

The group is exposed to changes in interest rates as funds are borrowed at both fixed and floating interest
rates. The hedging strategy approved by the treasury committee defines the appropriate mix between fixed and
floating borrowings. Cross-currency and interest rate swap contracts are used to manage the fixed/fldating ratio.

Debt with a nominal value of £4,480m (2023: £7,810m) is arranged at or swapped into fixed interest rates and
exposes the group to fair value interest rate risk. Other borrowings were arranged at or swapped into floating
rates, thus exposing the group to cash flow interest rate risk.

The group has certain debt issuances which are index-linked and so are exposed to movements in inflation
rates. The group does not enter into any derivative arrangements to hedge its exposure to inflation in relation to
its index-linked debt, but rather to mitigate the effects of inflation on the group's retail price index-linked revenue
streams.

Sensitivity analysis

This sensitivity analysis has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates and inflation for both
derivative and non-derivative financial instruments at the balance sheet date. A one per cent increase or
decrease represents management's assessment of the reasonably possible changes in average interest rates

and inflation.

31 March 2024 31 March 2023
Impact on the Impact on the
income income
statement statement
Group and company £m £m
1% increase in the interest rate 59 100
1% increase in the GBP RPI on index (222) (214)

linked bonds .

Aone per cent decrease in the above rate would have an equal and opposite effect.

Interest rate sensitivities have been calculated by comparing the average rates of the derivative financial
instruments to the market rate for similar instruments.

The impact of a change in GBP RPI has been calculated by applying a change of one per cent to the RPI at the
balance sheet date to the carrying value of the index linked bonds.

Intercompany loans and Embedded derivatives

The obligations and rights of Network Rail Infrastructure Limited under the inter-company loan agreement with
its financing company give rise to an embedded derivative in that agreement which reflects the external
currency and interest rates risks to which the financing company is exposed. The embedded derivative is
treated as a separate derivative and is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy disclosed in Note
2.

After the embedded derivative has been separated, the intercompany loan is measured at amortised cost.
There is a corresponding asset in Network Rail Infrastructure Finance Plc. However, that asset is designated
and measured at Fair Value Through Profit and Loss (FVTPL) using mid-market price.

Liquidity risk management

The ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the board of directors. The policy manual
ratified by the treasury committee includes an appropriate liquidity risk management framework covering the
company’s short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements. The Treasury funding
is subject to regular internal audits. Treasury provides sufficient liquidity to meet the company's needs, while
reducing financial risks and prudently maximising interest receivable and credit risk on surplus cash.

The group manages liquidity risk by maintaining sufficient cash and facilities to cover at least one year's
working capital requirement by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows. Included in Note 18 is a
description of additional undrawn facilities that the group has at its disposal to further reduce liquidity risk.

The following table details the group and company's remaining contractual maturity for their financial liabilities.
The table has been drawn up on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date
on which the group can be required to pay and, therefore, differs from both the carrying value and the fair value.
The table includes both interest and principal cash flows.

Fair value measurements recognised in the balance sheet

The ‘following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial
recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable:

* Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets

for identical assets or liabilities

« Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included

within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly

{i.e., derived from prices); and

* Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for

the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

26. Retirement benefit schemes

Defined contribution schemes

On 1 April 2004 the company introduced a defined contribution pension scheme, the Network Rail Defined
Contribution Pension Scheme (NRDCPS). These schemes are offered to all new employees of Network Rail,
except those who have the legal right to join the Railway Pension Scheme (RPS). Any employee who wishes to
transfer from the Network Rail Section of the RPS to the NRDCPS is entitled to do so.

At 31 March 2024, the NRDCPS had 12,782 active members (2023: 12,122) and the average employer
contribution rate in the year was 4 per cent (2023: 3 per cent).

The estimated amounts of contributions expected to be paid by the company and by members to the schemes
during the year ended 31 March 2025 are £129m and £82m respectively.

Defined benefit schemes

The principal pension scheme in which the company participates is the Railway Pension Scheme (RPS), which
was established by statutory instrument, commenced on 1 October 1994 and is a funded defined benefit
arrangement. The assets and liabilities under the predecessor scheme, the British Rail Pension Scheme
(BRPS), were transferred to the RPS on that date. The RPS is an industry-wide scheme for all eligible
employees within the railway industry. There are different sections within it for different employers. The assets
and liabilities of each section are identified separately from those of the other sections. The company has its
own section, the Network Rail Shared Cost Section (the Network Rail Section). This scheme, the assets of
which are held separately from the company, is contributory and provides pensions related to pay at retirement.

The assets transferred to the RPS from the BRPS on 1 October 1994 were apportioned among the various
sections of the RPS in accordance with the methods and assumptions specified in The Railways Pensions
(Transfer and Miscellaneous Provisions) Order 1994 (the ‘Transfer Order’) which effected the transfer. The
amount credited to the Network Rail Section included a share of the surplus at that time.

Since 1 April 2004, new members can only join the Network Rail Section of the RPS after completing five years
of service. Benefits for existing members and employees joining up to and including 31 March 2004 were not
affected by the revised eligibility rules of the Network Rail Section. In addition, the company announced its
decision to cap its contribution to British Railways Additional Superannuation Scheme (BRASS) matching at
current levels for existing employees and to dispense with matching for new employees. The company will
continue to match regular contributions but will not increase them in cash terms in the future.

On 1 November 2008 Network Rail launched a third pension scheme — the Career Average Revalued Earnings
(CARE) scheme, which is available to all employees.

Qualified actuaries Willis Towers Watson have valued the schemes on an IAS 19 (revised) basis at 31 March
2024 and 31 March 2023.

The contributions required to fund the RPS and the CARE scheme are reassessed every three years, following
completion of actuarial valuations (by the Scheme Actuaries). The last full actuarial valuations of both the RPS
and CARE schemes were undertaken by the Scheme Actuaries, at WTW and XPS respectively. These triennial
valuations as at 31 December 2022 showed a technical funding surplus of £2,350m for RPS and a £40m deficit
for CARE.

Under the terms of the Pensions Act 2004, the Trustee and each employer must agree the methods and
assumptions used to calculate the ‘Technical Provisions’, i.e. assets required to meet the Section’s liabilities.
The assumptions agreed are typically weaker than those used for IAS 19 purposes in current market conditions,
so the minimum funding requirement in itself requires no further adjustment to the [AS 19 obligations below.
However, the regulatory regime may, depending on legal advice received at the appropriate time, mean that a
future employer's accounting surplus would need to be restricted.

The RPS and CARE schemes are both shared cost in nature, so the cost of benefits being earned and the cost
of funding any shortfall in the schemes are normally split in the proportion 60:40 between the company and the
members. In practice the contributions are adjusted at each triennial valuation to reflect the funding position of
the schemes at that time.

Where a deficit arises, the provisions in the rules mean that the company and members benefit from or pay for
this respectively in the proportion 60:40.

26. Retirement benefit schemes (continued)

During the period, the RPS Section has moved into a £82m surplus. The group has considered the scheme
tules and concluded we have an unconditional right to the return of surplus assets in the RPS scheme and
hence have recognised 100% of the surplus. The basis for this judgement is that Network Rail are able to veto
any proposed utilisation of the surplus and the Trustees cannot unilaterally wind up the scheme. If in the event
of a wind up of the scheme, there are no beneficiaries remaining, then the surplus would be returned to
Network Rail. While it is considered extremely unlikely that Network Rail would veto any use of the surplus until
such time that no beneficiaries are alive, the result is nonetheless that Network Rail have an unconditional right

of the surplus in line with the accounting recognition requirements of IFRIC 14.

The group is exposed to a number of risks relating to the scheme including assumptions not being borne out in
practice. The most significant risks are as follows:

Asset volatility

There is a risk that a fall in asset values is not matched by corresponding reduction in the value places on the
defined benefit obligation scheme (DBO). The scheme holds a proportion of growth assets, which are expected
to outperform corporate and government bond yields in the long term but gives exposure to volatility and risk in
the short-term.

Change in bond yields

A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed on the scheme DBO, although this will be
partially offset by an increase in the value of the scheme's corporate bond holdings.

Inflation risk

The majority of the scheme's DBO is linked to inflation where higher inflation will lead to higher value being
placed on the DBO. Some of the scheme assets are either unaffected by inflation or loosely correlated with
inflation (e.g. growth assets), meaning that an increase in inflation will generally increase the deficit. The CPI(H)
assumption is derived from the RPI assumption. On 4 September 2019, the Government and UK Statistics
Authority (UKSA) published correspondence relating to the future of RPI. A consultation on the proposed
changes ran from March to August 2020 and a formal response to the consultation was published on 25
November 2020. Given that the UKSA have noted their intention to align RPI with CPIH from February 2030,
the post-2030 market-implied RP! assumption should theoretically reflect market expectations for CPI(H). CPIH
has historically been closely aligned with CPI, so it has been assumed there is a nil gap between RPI and
CPI(H) from February 2030. This calculation assumes the market has not included any compensation or
adjustment for the change from RPI to CPI(H) from 2030. The starting point for the RPI assumption is the yield
rate curve reflecting the scheme’s average duration of 19 years. The rate is then adjusted downwards to reflect
the fact that buyers of these instruments are prepared to pay a premium for inflation protection and as such the
yield is not a true reflection of market expectations of inflation. The approach over the adjustment is consistent
in 2024 and 2023. The difference between RPI and CPI(H) is 30bps (2023: 40bps). The reduction in the amount
is due to the passing of time as we near 2030.

Life expectancy

Future mortality rates cannot be predicted with certainty. An increase in life expectancy will lead to an increase
in the scheme'’s defined benefit obligations, whilst a decrease in life expectancy will decrease those obligations.
In the year-ended 31 March 2024 life expectancy assumptions have been reduced slightly in line with emerging
long-term forecasts and trends. These changes are in line with the pension scheme's triennial valuation.

Discount rate

The discount rate needs to be based upon yields on high quality corporate bonds at the balance sheet date. A
range of bonds are included when calculating this rate. Further, extrapolation of bond yields is required where
there is a lack of bonds at long duration.

Actuarial assumption sensitivity

The discount rate is set by reference to market conditions at the reporting date, and can vary significantly
between periods.

The earnings increases are linked to inflation and so set by reference to market conditions at the reporting date.

Actuarial assumption sensitivity (continued)

The mortality assumptions used are set by considering the experience of the scheme’s members, and by
making an allowance for possible future improvements in longevity. Mortality assumptions are difficult to set
accurately and forecasting rates of future mortality improvement is inevitably speculative.

Expected future benefit payments from the Network Rail Section, based on data from the 2019 formal valuation
and the 31 March 2024 IAS 19 assumptions are as follows:

£m
Benefits expected to be paid within 12 months 295
Benefits expected to be paid between 2 to 3 years 586
Benefits expected to be paid between 4 to 6 years 1,011
Benefits expected to be paid between 7 to 10 years 1,599
Benefits expected to be paid between 11 to 15 years 2,338
Benefits expected to be paid in over 15 years 15,546
