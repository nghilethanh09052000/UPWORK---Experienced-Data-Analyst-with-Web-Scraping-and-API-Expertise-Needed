STATUTORY INFORMATION

Total Training Provision Limited is a private company, limited by shares , registered in England and Wales. The company’s
registered number and registered office address can be found on the Company Information page.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of preparing the financial statements

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102 "The Financial
Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland” including the provisions of Section 1A "Small Entities"
and the Companies Act 2006. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.

Turnover

Turnover is recognised at the fair value of the consideration reccived or receivable for goods and services
provided in the normal course of business, and is shown net of VAT and other sales related taxes. The fair
value of consideration takes into account trade discounts, settlement discounts and volume rebates.

When cash inflows are deferred and represent a financing arrangement, the fair value of the consideration
is the present value of the future receipts. The difference between the fair value of the consideration and
the nominal amount received is recognised as interest income.

Revenue from contracts for the provision of professional services is recognised by reference to the stage

of completion when the stage of completion, costs incurred and costs to complete can be estimated

reliably. The stage of completion is calculated by comparing costs incurred, mainly in relation to contractual
hourly staff rates and materials, as a proportion of total costs. Where the outcome cannot be estimated
reliably, revenue is recognised only to the extent of the expenses recognised that it is probable will be
recovered,

Tangible fixed assets
Depreciation is provided at the following annual rates in order to write off each asset over its estimated useful life.
Plant and machinery etc - 25% on cost and 25% on reducing balance

Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are recognised at cost.

Taxation
Taxation for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Income Statement, except to the extent
that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.

Current or deferred taxation assets and liabilities are not discounted.

Current tax is recognised at the amount of tax payable using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the balance sheet date.

Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date.

Timing differences arise from the inclusion of income and expenses in tax assessments in periods different from those in
which they are recognised in financial statements. Deferred tax is measured using tax rates and laws that have been enacted

or substantively enacted by the period end and that are expected to apply to the reversal of the timing difference.

Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that they will be
recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.
