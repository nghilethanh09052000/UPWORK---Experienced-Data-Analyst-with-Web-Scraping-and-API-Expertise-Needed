Accounting policies

Company information
Martec Training Limited is a private company limited by shares incorporated in England and Wales.
The registered office is London Road, Lyme Valley, Newcastle under Lyme, Staffordshire, ST5 LLZ.

Accounting convention

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 102 “The Financial Reporting
Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland” (“FRS 102”) and the requirements of the
Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies subject to the small companies regime. The
disclosure requirements of section 1A of FRS 102 have been applied other than where additional
disclosure is required to show a true and fair view.

The financial staternents are prepared in sterling, which is the functional currency of the company.
Monetary amounts in these financial statements are rounded to the nearest £.

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention. The principal
accounting policies adopted are set out below.

Martec Training Limited is a wholly owned subsidiary of Marson Garages Holdings Limited and the
results af Martec Training Limited are included in the consolidated financial statements of Marson
Garage Holdings Limited which are available from Tern Hill Hall, Tern Hill, Market Drayton, England,
TF9 3PU.

Turnover

Turnover is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods and
services provided in the normal course of business, and is shown net of VAT and other sales related
taxes. The fair value of consideration takes into account trade discounts, settlement discounts and
volume rebates.

Revenue from contracts for the provision of professional services is recognised by reference to the
stage of completion when the stage of completion, costs incurred and costs to complete can be
estimated reliably. The stage of completion is calculated by comparing costs incurred, mainly in
relation to contractual hourly staff rates and materials, as a proportion of total costs. Where the
outcome cannot be estimated reliably, revenue is recognised only to the extent of the expenses
recognised that it is probable will be recovered.

Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost or valuation,
net of depreciation and any impairment fosses.

Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values
over their useful lives on the following bases:

Plant and machinery 20% reducing balance
Fixtures and fittings 25% reducing balance
Computer equipment 25% straight line

Motor vehicles 25% reducing balance

The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the sale
proceeds and the carrying value of the asset, and is credited or charged to profit or loss.

Accounting policies {Continued)

Impairment of fixed assets

At each reporting period end date, the company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible assets
to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If
any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the
extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of
an individua! asset, the company estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to
which the asset belongs.

Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value
in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount
rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the
asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents are basic financial assets and include cash in hand, deposits held at cal!
with banks, other short-term liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, and
bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities.

Financial instruments
The company has elected to apply the provisions of Section 11 ‘Basic Financial Instruments’ and
Section 12 ‘Other Financial Instruments Issues’ of FRS 102 to all of its financial instruments.

Financial instruments are recognised in the company's statement of financial position when the
company becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

Financial assets and liabilities are offset, with the net amounts presented in the financial statements,
when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention
to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Basic financial assets

Basic financial assets, which include debtors and cash and bank balances, are initially measured at
transaction price including transaction costs and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the
effective interest method unless the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where the
transaction is measured at the present value of the future receipts discounted at a market rate of
interest. Financial assets classified as receivable within one year are not amortised,

Classification of financial liabilities

Financial tiabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual
arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in
the assets of the company after deducting all of its liabilities.

Accounting policies (Continued)

Basic financial liabilities

Basic financial liabilities, including creditors and bank loans, are initially recognised at transaction
price unless the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where the debt instrument is
measured at the present value of the future payments discounted at a market rate of interest.
Financial liabilities classified as payable within one year are not amortised.

Debt instruments are subsequently carried at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate
method.

Trade creditors are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary
course of business from suppliers. Amounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is
due within one year or less. If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities. Trade creditors are
recognised initially at transaction price and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the
effective interest method.

Equity instruments

Equity instruments issued by the company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of transaction
costs. Dividends payable on equity instruments are recognised as liabilities once they are no longer
at the discretion of the company.

Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.

Current tax

The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit
as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable
or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The
company’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the reporting end date.

Deferred tax

Deferred tax liabilities are generatly recognised for all timing differences and deferred tax assets are
recognised to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of
deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if
the timing difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition of other assets and liabilities
in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting end date and reduced to
the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or
part of the asset to be recovered. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to
apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged or
credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to
equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. Deferred tax assets and lfabilities
are offset when the company has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities
and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority.

Employee benefits
The costs of short-term employee benefits are recognised as a liability and an expense, unless those
costs are required to be recognised as part of the cost of stock or fixed assets.

The cost of any unused holiday entitlement is recognised in the period in which the employee’s
services are received.

Termination benefits are recognised immediately as an expense when the company is demonstrably
committed to terminate the employment of an employee or to provide termination benefits.

1.10 Retirement benefits

Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall
due.
