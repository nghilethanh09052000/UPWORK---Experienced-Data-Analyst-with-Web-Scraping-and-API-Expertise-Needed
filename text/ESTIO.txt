STRATEGIC REPORT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2023

The directors present the strategic report for the year ended 31 August 2023.

Fair review of the business

Year Period % change
ended 31 ended 31
August 2023 August 2022
Turnover £000's 13,026 15,039 ~13%
Operating profit £000's 1,707 3,054 44%
Operating profit margin (1) % 13% 20%

1) Operating profit margin % is operating profit divided by turnover.

Turnover for the period decreased by £2,013 million (13%) compared to the prior year, which is due to a decrease
in student volumes in apprenticeship programmes across the product portfolio.

Operating profit decreased by £1,247 million in actual terms and operating profit margin decreased by 1 ppt. In this
movement, is a reduction in gross margin from 51% to 37% driven by a decrease in student volumes, increases in
wages and salary costs and a decrease in administrative expenses (including group management charges).

Compared with the prior year, the company net assets increased by £1.608 million (31%) which occurred as a
result of the positive cash flows generated, along with movements in intercompany balances as a result of the
change of ownership and financing of the wider group. Otherwise, the financial position of the company and
associated working capital cycle remains consistent with the prior year and the size, scale and nature of the
business.

These financial statements are drawn up for the year ended 31 August 2023 ("the financial year’). In the prior
period, the accounting reference date was changed and brought in line with that of other group companies, As a
result, comparative amounts disclosed are for the 13 month period to 31 August 2022. Therefore, some of the
reduction noted above is as a result of the current year being shorter than the comparative period.

Principal risks and uncertainties

Compliance and regulatory risk

The company operates in markets where many of our competitors are professional education providers. Any
change in the existing tax regimes or government education policy could put us at a competitive disadvantage and
reduce our ability to compete on a level playing field.

As the business continues to expand into the apprenticeship training market, there is further exposure to risk as this
area is heavily regulated with the requirement for regular Office for Standards in Education (Ofsted) and Education
and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) reviews. Management have implemented an infrastructure to manage this
regulatory risk, which is under regular review and evolves as required.

The principal matters related to compliance and regulatory risks are as follows:
* ESFA status as an approved Independent Training Provider — the company remains registered as at the
date of this report.

¢ Ofsted inspection grading — during the 2021 financial year, the company was subject to an OFSTED
monitoring visit, which resulted in a “Significant Progress’ Grade, which is the highest that can be
achieved. A full OFSTED visit was conducted, for which we were awarded a Grade 2 result, which means
OFSTED deem us to be a “Good” provider. We would like to thank ali of our colleagues for their hard work
in making these grades possible, and are delighted that OFSTED saw fit to award these gradings. No
further OFSTED reviews have taken place since.


ESTIO TRAINING LIMITED

STRATEGIC REPORT (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2023

Principal risks and uncertainties (continued)

+ ESFA Funding Rules — the maximum funding bands which govern the funding available to the company for
delivering training are set by the Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education. A route review has
been completed of the majority of standards delivered by the sub-group with no changes to funding band
maxima. Other technical changes to the funding rules are typically made annually to apply from 1 August,
and this year have focussed on breaks in apprenticeships and eligible costs, which are expected to only
have a minor impact on future revenues.

* ESFA contract for delivery of apprenticeships to non-Levy payers — the sub-group has a direct contract with
the ESFA, subject to an overall limit of funding available. These contracts are in the latter stages of being
concluded and no material future funding is dependent upon the existence of, or continuation of, these
contracts.

Market risk
The company has in place an on-going process for identifying, evaluating and managing market risks that the
company may be exposed to.

The Apprenticeship Levy continues to represent a significant market opportunity given the marked increase in
funding. However, this also represents a risk to the business as it seeks to grow sustainably in the face of this
market opportunity. We seek to manage this by maintaining close relationships with key parties invoNed in policy
and funding.

Future developments

Apprenticeship starts in the first quarter of FY24 were in line with targets set. There has been a restructuring in the
sales team since along with a migration to a new sales system that is aimed to allow the company to achieve
further growth as demand continues to increase in the sector.

There is continuing UK Government commitment to invest in training, particularly in Digital areas and for young
people. The support of our employees, our learners and their employers has been instrumental in the success of
Estio to date and will remain the cornerstones as we continue to move forwards.

The current outlook for the company is positive. We continue to invest in, and launch, new products to help
strengthen the company's position in the market. The Apprenticeship Levy continues to represent a significant
market opportunity and should iead to an increase in training activity which the company needs to use their core
competencies and experience to capitalise on.

Key performance indicators
In addition to revenue and operating profit margin (see Fair review of business above), the key performance
indicators used by the company comprise a mix of financial and non-financial measures as follows.

Non-Financial key performance indicators include:
« Number of active learners
+ Learners exceeding planned duration of training

Al the period end, the company had 1,140 (2022— 1,185) active learners, an decrease of 45 from 2022.

ESTIO TRAINING LIMITED

DIRECTORS' REPORT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2023

The directors present their annual report and financial statements for the year ended 31 August 2023.

Principal activities
The company acts as an Independent Training Provider for Digital Apprenticeships in England under contracts with
the Education and Skills Funding Agency (‘ESFA’) and Apprenticeship Levy paying employers.

Results and dividends
The results for the year are set out on page 10.

No ordinary dividends were paid (period ended 31 August 2022 - £nil). The directors do not recommend payment of
a final dividend.

Directors
The directors who held office during the year and up to the date of signature of the financial statements were as
follows:

SS Kay
PR Rowlett

GS M Gaddes
JC Preston-Taytor

Qualifying third party indemnity provisions
The company has made qualifying third party indemnity provisions for the benefit of its directors during the year.
These provisions remain in force at the reporting date.

Financial risk management objectives and policies
The principal financial risks, with their associated exposure and management, to the company are:

Price risk

The price of each course is determined nationally and is subject to review outside of the direct control of the
company. Changes to ESFA rules and regulations are monitored by the company’s SLT, who will notify of any
upcoming changes to be included in projected forecasts to assess the exposure and to manage any associated
risks.

Credit risk

The majority of revenue is derived from the ESFA, and is received in cash once a month. The remainder is co-
investment income, which is invoiced to an employer when their learner starts the course and collected within the
terms of the credit agreement. Credit contro! procedures are in place within the business to follow a step-by-step
process to collect any overdue debt, however, considering the co-investment income is a relatively small proportion
of revenue, this is considered a Jow overa!] risk to the business.

Liquidity risk

Management prepare detailed trading, profit and loss and cashflow forecasts to monitor liquidity reserves. At the
reporting date end, the company held cash at bank of £2.0m (2022 - £2.5m).


ESTIO TRAINING LIMITED

DIRECTORS’ REPORT (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2023

Cash flow risk

The main cash inflows for the company are from the ESFA, based on active learners and their progress on courses,
with the main cash outflows being supplier payments and salaries. Management prepare rolling cashflow forecasts
based on the current learner book and projections based on their best estimate of current and future economic
conditions.

Auditor
The auditor, RSM UK Audit LLP, is deemed to be reappointed under section 487(2) of the Companies Act 2006.

Strategic report

The company has chosen in accordance with Companies Act 2006, s. 414C(11) to set out in the company's
strategic report information required by Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports)
Regulations 2008, Sch. 7 to be contained in the directors’ report. It has done so in respect of future developments.

Statement of disclosure to auditor

So far as each person who was a director at the date of approving this report is aware, there is no relevant audit
information of which the company’s auditor is unaware. Additionally, each director has taken all the necessary steps
that they ought to have taken as a director in order to make themselves aware of all relevant audit information and
to establish that the company's auditor is aware of that information.

ESTIO TRAINING LIMITED

DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES STATEMENT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2023

The directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report and the financial
statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.

Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the
directors have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company law the directors
must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of
affairs of the company and of the profit or loss of the company for that period. In preparing these financial
statements, the directors are required to:

* select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;

+ make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;

* prepare the financial statements on the going concem basis unless It is inappropriate to presume that the
company will continue in business.

The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the
company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company
and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.


INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ESTIO TRAINING
LIMITED

Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of Estio Training Limited (the ‘company’) for the year ended 31 August
2023 which comprise the income statement, the statement of financial position, the statement of changes in equity
and notes to the financial statements, including significant accounting policies. The financial reporting framework
that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including
FRS 102 “The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland” (United Kingdom
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

In our opinion, the financial statements:
* give a true and fair view of the state of the company's affairs as at 31 August 2023 and of its profit for the year
then ended;
* have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice;
* have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable
law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of
the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the company in accordance with the ethical
requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical
Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe
that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Conclusions relating to going concern
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of
accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or
conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going
concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the
relevant sections of this report.

Other information

The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements
and our auditor's report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual
report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent
otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is
materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit or
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material
misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a materia! misstatement in the financial
statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material
misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.

Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
* the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial period for which the
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
* the strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal
requirements.


INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ESTIO TRAINING
LIMITED (CONTINUED)

Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the course of the
audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report.

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires
us to report to you if, in our opinion:
* adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received
from branches not visited by us; or
« the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
* certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
¢ we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

Responsibilities of directors

As explained more fully in the directors! responsibilities statement set out on page 6, the directors are responsible
for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such
internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the company's ability to continue
as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of
accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic
alternative but to do so.

Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance
with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or
errar and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

The extent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud
Itregularities are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. The objectives of our audit are to obtain
sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding compliance with laws and regulations that have a direct effect on the
determination of material amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, to perform audit procedures to help
identify instances of non-compliance with other laws and regulations that may have a material effect on the financial
statements, and to respond appropriately to identified or suspected noncompliance with laws and regulations
identified during the audit.

In relation to fraud, the objectives of our audit are to identify and assess the risk of material misstatement of the
financial statements due to fraud, to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the assessed risks of
material misstatement due to fraud through designing and implementing appropriate responses and to respond
appropriately to fraud or suspected fraud identified during the audit.

However, it is the primary responsibility of management, with the oversight of those charged with governance, to
ensure that the entity's operations are conducted in accordance with the provisions of laws and regulations and for
the prevention and detection of fraud.

In identifying and assessing risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including fraud, the audit
engagement team:

* obtained an understanding of the nature of the industry and sector, including the legal and regulatory
framework that the company operates in and how the company is complying with the legal and regulatory
framework;

* inquired of management, and those charged with governance, about their own identification and
assessment of the risks of irregularities, including any known actual, suspected or alleged instances of
fraud;

* discussed matters about non-compliance with laws and regulations and how fraud might occur including
assessment of how and where the financial statements may be susceptible to fraud


INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ESTIO TRAINING
LIMITED (CONTINUED)

As a result of these procedures we consider the most significant laws and regulations that have a direct impact on
the financial statements are FRS 102, the Companies Act 2006 and tax compliance regulations. We performed
audit procedures to detect non-compliances which may have a material impact on the financial staternents which
included reviewing financial statement disclosures, review of disclosures checklists to identify areas of non-
compliance and inspection and review of tax computationsAvorkings prepared by the company’s tax advisors.

The most significant laws and regulations that have an indirect impact on the financial statements are those in
relation to the Office for Standards in Education, Children’s Services and Skills (Ofsted) and the Education and
Skills funding agency (ESFA). We performed audit procedures including inquiry of management as to whether the
company is in compliance with these law and regulations and inspected correspondence with the relevant
regulatory authorities.

The audit engagement team identified the risk of management override of controls and revenue recognition
(existence, valuation cut off) as the areas where the financial statements were most susceptible to material
misstatement due to fraud. Audit procedures performed in respect of management override of controls included but
were nat limited to testing the appropriateness of journal entries and other adjustments, assessing whether the
judgements made and assumptions used in making accounting estimates are indicative of a potential bias and
evaluating the business rationale of any significant transactions that were unusual or outside the normal course of
business. Audit procedures performed in respect of revenue recognition (cut off, existence and valuation) included
but were not limited to testing the existence of learners to supporting agreements and other records, agreeing
revenue recognised to cash receipts, testing revenue transactions to ensure they were recognised in the correct
accounting period and testing accrued and deferred income and the inputs used in calculations by agreeing to
supporting evidence.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial
Reporting Council's website at: https:/Awww.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities This description forms part of our
auditor's report.

Use of our report

This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company's members those
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company's
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

ESTIO TRAINING LIMITED

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2023

1 Accounting policies (Continued)

Going concern
The directors have prepared forecasts in respect of future trading to assist in the assessment of going
concern for the purpose of approving these financial statements.

In developing these forecasts, the directors have made assumptions based upon their view of the current and
future economic conditions that will prevail over the long term forecast period to 31 August 2028.

Considering the impact upon economic activity both within the Digital Apprenticeship sector and the Wider UK
and global economy the directors acknowledge that the future trading environment may remain challenging.
The directors note that should conditions prove to be even more challenging than foreseen, further options
are available to ensure the going concem status of the company, including but not limited to deferral or
cancellation of capital or project spend and cost reduction exercises which are entirely within the discretion of
the directors and would involve negligible up-front costs.

Considering the forecasts, sensitivities, funding available, and the wider support that the company continues
to enjoy from its ultimate parent company, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the company will
be able to continue to meet is liabilities as they fall due for the foreseeable future. As such it remains the view
of the directors that it remains appropriate to prepare these financial statements on a going concern basis.

Reporting period

The financial statements are drawn up for the year ended 31 August 2023 ("the financial year"). In the prior
period, the accounting reference date was brought in line with that of other group companies. Comparative
figures are for the 13 month period to 31 August 2022. Therefore the previous period of account is not directly
comparable,

Turnover
Turnover is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for services provided in the
normal course of business, and is shown net of VAT and other sales related taxes.

Revenue from the provision of training services is recognised on a straight line basis over the expected
fearning period, and when specific milestones have been completed in accordance with the contractual terms.

Intangible fixed assets other than goodwill
Intangible fixed assets are initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost, net of amortisation
and any impairment losses.

The company capitalises development expenditure as an intangible asset when it is able to demonstrate all of
the following:

(a) The technical feasibility of completing the development so the intangible asset will be available for use or
sale.

(b) Its intention to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset.

(c) ts ability to use or sell the intangible asset.

(d) How the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits,

(e} The availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and ta
use or Sell the intangible asset.

(f} Its ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development.

Amartisation is recognised so as ta write off the cost of assets less their residual values over their useful lives
on the following bases:

IT software 33% straight line
Development costs 20% straight line

Accounting policies (Continued)

Amortisation of development costs commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.

Tangible fixed assets

Tangible fixed assets are initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost, net of depreciation

and any impairment losses.

Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost of assets less their residual values over their useful lives
on the following bases:

Leasehold improvements over the remainder of the lease

The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the sale
proceeds and the carrying value of the asset, and is credited or charged to profit or loss.

Fixed asset investments

Interests in subsidiaries are initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost less any
accumulated impairment losses. The investments are assessed for impairment at each reporting date and
any impairment losses or reversals of impairment losses are recognised immediately in profit or loss.

A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the company. Control is the power to govern the financial and operating
policies of the entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.

Impairment of fixed assets

At each reporting period end date, the company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible
assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any
such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the
impairment loss (if any).

Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use,
the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the
estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.

If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of
the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss,
unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a
revaluation decrease.

Financial instruments
The company has elected to apply the provisions of Section 11 ‘Basic Financial Instruments’ and Section 12
‘Other Financial Instruments Issues’ of FRS 102 to all of its financial instruments.

Financial instruments are recognised when the company becomes party to the contractual provisions of the
instrument.

Financial assets and liabilities are offset, with the net amounts presented in the financial statements, when
there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a
net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Accounting policies (Continued)

Basic financial assets

Basic financial assets, which include trade and other debtors, accrued income, amounts owed by group
undertakings and cash and bank balances, are initially measured at transaction price including transaction
costs and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method unless the
arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where the financial asset is measured at the present value of
the future receipts discounted at a market rate of interest.

Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets, other than those held at fair value through profit and loss, are assessed for indicators of
impairment at each reporting end date.

Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that
occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows have been affected.
If an asset is impaired, the impairment loss is the difference between the carrying amount and the present
value of the estimated cash flows discounted at the asset's original effective interest rate. The impairment loss
is recognised in profit or loss.

Hf there is a decrease in the impairment loss arising from an event occurting after the impairment was
recognised, the impairment is reversed. The reversal is such that the current carrying amount does not
exceed what the carrying amount would have been, had the impairment not previously been recognised. The
impairment reversal is recognised in profit or loss.

Derecognition of financial assets

Financial assets are derecognised only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or
are settled, or when the company transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership to another entity, or if some significant risks and rewards of ownership are retained but control of
the asset has transferred to another party that is able to sell the asset in its entirety to an unrelated third party.

Classification of financial liabilities

Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual
arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the
assets of the company after deducting all of its liabilities.

Basic financial liabilities

Basic financial fiabilities, including trade and other creditors, accruals and amounts owed to group
undertakings, are initially recognised at transaction price unless the arrangement constitutes a financing
transaction, where the debt instrument is measured at the present value of the future payments discounted at
a market rate of interest.

Debt instruments are subsequently carried at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.

Derecognition of financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are derecognised when, and only when, the company’s contractual obligations are
discharged, cancelled, or they expire.

Equity instruments

Equity instruments issued by the company are recorded at the fair value of proceeds received, net of
transaction costs. Dividends payable on equity instruments are recognised as liabilities once they are no
longer at the discretion of the company.

1 Accounting policies (Continued)

Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the current tax expense and deferred tax expense. Current tax assets
are recognised when tax paid exceeds the tax payable.

Current and deferred fax is charged or credited to profit or loss, except when it relates to items charged or
credited to other comprehensive income or equity, when the tax follows the transaction or event it relates to
and is also charged or credited to other comprehensive income, or equity.

Current tax assets and current tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset, if
and only if, there is a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and the entity intends either to settle on
the net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year. Current tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax
rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.

Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised
or the liability is settled based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting
date.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised in respect of all timing differences that exist at the reporting date. Timing
differences are differences between taxable profits and total comprehensive income that arise from the
inclusion of income and expenses in tax assessments in different periods from their recognition in the
financial statements. Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that they will be
recovered by the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.

Employee benefits
The costs of short-term employee benefits are recognised as a liability and an expense.

The cost of any unused holiday entitlement is recognised in the period in which the employee’s services are
received.

Termination benefits are recognised immediately as an expense when the company is demonstrably
committed to terminate the employment of an employee or to provide termination benefits.

Retirement benefits

For defined contribution schemes the amount charged to profit or loss is the contributions payable in the year.
Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown as either
other creditors or other debtors.

Share-based payments

Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant by reference to the fair
value of the equity instruments granted using the Black-Scholes model. The fair value determined at the grant
date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the estimate of shares that will
eventually vest. A corresponding adjustment is made to equity.

When the terms and conditions of equity-settled share-based payments at the time they were granted are
subsequently modified, the fair value of the share-based payment under the original terms and conditions and
under the modified terms and conditions are both determined at the date of the modification. Any excess of
the modified fair value over the original fair value is recognised over the remaining vesting period in addition
to the grant date fair value of the original share-based payment. The share-based payment expense is not
adjusted if the modified fair value is less than the original fair value.

Cancellations or settlements (including those resulting from employee redundancies) are treated as an
acceleration of vesting and the amount that would have been recognised over the remaining vesting period is
recognised immediately.

Leases

Rentals payable under operating leases, including any lease incentives received, are charged to profit or joss
on a straight jine basis over the term of the relevant lease except where another more systematic basis is
more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leases asset are consumed.

Foreign exchange
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency (foreign currency) are initially recorded at the
exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction.

All translation differences are taken to profit or loss, except to the extent that they relate to gains or losses on
non-monetary items recognised in other comprehensive income, when the related translation gain or loss is
also recognised in other comprehensive income.

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling
at the reporting date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at
the rate ruling at the date of the transaction or, if the asset or liability is measured at fair value, the rate when
that fair value was determined,

2 Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty

In the application of the company’s accounting policies, the directors are required to make judgements,
estimates and assumptions about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other
factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting
estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised where the revision affects only that
period, or in the period of the revision and future periods where the revision affects both current and future
periods.

In the opinion of the directors, there are no material judgements, apart from those involving estimates, that
have a significant impact in applying the company's accounting policies.

Key sources of estimation uncertainty

Apprenticeship funding

The ESFA Funding Year runs to 31 July annually. Funding is received monthly in arrears based upon training
delivered in any one period, with such amounts recognised as trade debtors / accrued income at the end of
each period. To ensure reconciliation with the Funding Year, additional returns are made for periods R13 and
R14 in September and October annually. The impact of funding adjustments processed via the R13 and R14
returns is accounted for in the results, via estimated adjustments to monthly income. These estimates are then
reviewed in arrears and full reconciliation of funding received performed to ensure that the estimates made
remain appropriate.

Revenue from apprenticeships is recognised based upon a combination of the ESFA funding profile, stage of
completion based upon total expected programme duration (including any extension for learners beyond
original planned end date) and assessment of the likelihood of the apprentice completing all elements of the
course, using historic information about the quantum and timing of early leavers. These estimates are
reviewed monthly which, allied to the close alignment of the company’s accounting date and ESFA Funding
Year, ensures that the risk of material adjustment is minimised in so far as practically possible.

In the budget on 3 March 2021, the UK Government announced an increase in the main UK corporation tax
rate from 19% to 25% with effect from 1 April 2023. The change in rate was substantively enacted on 24 May
2021. Deferred tax has been calculated at 25% which was the tax rate substantively enacted at 31 August

2023.
