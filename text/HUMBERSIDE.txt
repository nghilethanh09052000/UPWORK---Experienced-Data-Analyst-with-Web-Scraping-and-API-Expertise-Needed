Report of the Trustees
for the year ended 31st August 2024

Expertise, experience, capabilities of HETA

HETA is a not-for-profit Charity “Group Training Association” established in 1967 which now operates from 3 wholly
owned sites, Dansom Lane (Hull), Pioneer Park (Grimsby) and Foxhills (Scunthorpe) to serve employers across the Humber
Region that operate in the engineering, manufacturing and process industries.

The GTA model still exists in name but in real terms the company operates as a commercially focused but not for profit
training provider with a FE/Charitable ethos that serves our learners and employers to ensure we deliver training and
education that will meet the skills needs of the region.

Governance is provided by a group of Trustees who meet six times per year.

HETA currently employs around 80 people across the three sites with a turnover in excess of approx. £7m pa. Our real
estate is wholly owned.

HETA currently trains and assesses around 600 Engineering learners per year across levels 3, 4 & 5 and delivers ‘in-work’
training for adults to over 350 client companies across the Yorkshire and Humber region. HETA also delivers training
contracts for employers who have multiple sites across the UK.

STRUCTURE, GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT

Charity constitution

The company is limited by guarantee. It was incorporated on 7th April 1971 under the Companies Acts 1948 and 1967 and
is governed by its memorandum and Articles of Association as amended September 1980, April, 1995 and May 2021. A
furthcr amendment was approved by the HETA Board of Trustees in July 2024.

Recruitment and appointment of new trustees
HETA aims to develop and maintain a diverse group of individuals that will support the aim of the company. Trustees are
identified and recruited based on skill set and experience.

No one is entitled to act as a Trustee whether on appointment or on any reappointment until he or she has expressly
acknowledged, in whatever way the Trustee decide, his or her acceptance of the office of Trustee and Member.

The appointment of a Trustee must not cause the number of Trustees to exceed any number fixed as the maximum number
of Trustees.

The latest Articles of Association make clear reference to the period of time that Trustees will be appointed for.

The latest amendment to the Articles of Association now shows that the maximum number of Trustees has been increased to
15 people.

Organisational structure
The Board meet six times during the year. The meetings were concluded using a ‘hybrid’ model over both video
conferencing and face to face, This model provided members with a more efficient way to meet and increased participation.

HETA is managed by the Directors (Trustees) with day-to-day responsibility delegated to the Chief Executive who is
appointed by the Board.

The day to day strategic and operational management of HETA was carried out by the Senior (strategic) Leadership Team
(SLT) which during 2023-24, consisted of the following team members*;

Chief Executive

Deputy Chief Executive

Human Resources Manager

Operations Manager

Head of Quality and Curriculum Development (with effect from August 2024)

Page 3

Humberside Engineering Training

Report of the Trustees
for the year ended 31st August 2024

STRUCTURE, GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT - continued
In tum, the SLT is supported by an experienced and very able management team:

Health and Safety Manager

2 x Centre (curriculum) Managers

Field Team Manager

Curriculum Manager Higher Education

IT Support Manager

Management Accountant

Administration Manager

Teaching and Learning Improvement Manager
Sales and Marketing Manager

*From September 1", 2023, the post of Head of Sales and Marketing ceased to exist following the resignation of the post
holder and responsibility for this department has been taken over by the Sales and Marketing Manager.

The Management of Risk

HETA has adopted a Business Risk Register (BRR) and the Board will receive updates on each area of risk to assess the
appropriateness and robustness of the controls being deployed to mitigate risk. The BRR is reviewed periodically by the
management team and at board meetings by the Trustees.

Policy on Reserves

The charity will aim to hold, non-committed, end of year cash reserves of not less than 50% and not more than 150% of the
total annual staff and contractor employment costs. The reserves policy remains a key aspect of financial health, but the
Trustees continue to review this annually.

This formula will enable the directors and management of HETA adequate contingency funds to deal with significant
variations of year-to-year business activity.

At the Balance Sheet date the unrestricted cash reserves represented 25% (2023: 39%) of the year’s employment costs
(including subcontract instructors and excluding HATA apprentices). The board approved the reserves dropping below the
target in order to finance the construction of the new centre at Grimsby.

The need to vacate our previous (rented) premises at Stallingborough (Grimsby) and the strong desire to create a higher
quality, 21“ century Jearning and working environment was a driving force behind the new build project mentioned above.

For context, the construction phase probably started at the worst possible time post pandemic and a war in Ukraine. Material
costs were high, and price continuity was unpredictable added to by labour shortages which led to higher contractor prices.

Combining all this with the fact that the UK was in a ‘funding hiatus’ and that no additional capital grants were available,
this meant that the build project was financed from both bank borrowings and reserves.

Whilst the reserves policy exists, the board of Trustees approved that this can be flexible in order to achieve the project
completion.

Reserves for 2024-25 and 2025-26 are forecast to be at 22% and 38% respectively and rising in subsequent years taking
HETA back within the tolerances allowed in the reserves policy. HETA has a number of strategic aims of which one relates
to levels of debt; “To reduce our level of debt and increase our cash reserves”

The current reserves reflect the fact that the Board have chosen to ‘overpay’ on monthly capital payments that
will see the overall debt level reduced. Two building loans are scheduled to be paid off in December 2024 and July 2025.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND PERFORMANCE

Income Diversification

It is important that HETA follows a plan to diversify income and not be solely reliant on the core funding from the
Department of Education. Our commercial training courses have grown steadily with the expansion of our sales and
marketing function. It is important to note in addition to commercial sales, that this team drives the recruitment process for
both our Level 3 funded programmes and our Higher National education programmes that are mainly fee paying rather than
government funded.

Combining both income streams demonstrates a modest but healthy year on year increase.

Qut of Area Recruitment
HETA continues to recruit learners from outside of the Humber region. In 2023-24, we were successful in attracting
employers and their learners from West and South Yorkshire, London and the South East of England.

This pattern is continuing into 2024-25.

Armed Forces@HETA

HETA has been a signatory of the Armed Forces Covenant since 2022 and following a successful application, we have now
secured the next level up as a Silver Award holder. This follows a review of activities, policies and procedures and the
ability to demonstrate that we support the UK Armed Forces community.

The Armed Forces Covenant is a promise that together we acknowledge and understand that those who serve or have served
‘in the Armed Forces, and their families, including the bereaved, should be treated with faimess and respect in the

communities, economy, and society they serve with their lives.

https://www.armedforcescovenant.gov.uk/about-the-covenant/

HETA has been actively engaged with the armed forces to raise awareness of engineering careers for veterans transitioning
to civilian life. We provided Information, Advice, and Guidance (IAG) at key events, including the Catterick Army Base,
Manchester and London Veterans UK Roadshows, and attended events for cadets at Leconfield Barracks.

These initiatives highlighted the transferable skills veterans bring to the engineering sector and showcased the opportunities
available to them. Our dedication to supporting the armed forces community was recognised with the prestigious Silver
Armed Forces Covenant Award, reflecting our commitment to fostering career pathways for those who have served.

Ofsted

December 2023 saw HETA receive a full inspection from Ofsted-the previous inspection was in 2017. The outcome was
graded as Good-this matched the previous inspection grade. For more detailed information then please follow this link to

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND PERFORMANCE - continued

Funding and Fundraising Activities

Income streams at HETA are structured in such a way to provide some degree of financial security and sustainability that
allows us to reinvest in the best teaching and learning facilities and working conditions for staff.

In simple terms we aim to maintain four strands of revenue generation;

e Contracted funding from the Department for Education to support the delivery of funded programmes including
Apprenticeships and Traineeships.

e Higher Education that is paid for by employers to deliver the Higher National Certificate and Diploma.
e« Commercial training courses to upskill those already in the labour market paid for by employers and individuals.

© Additional grant funding from different sources designed to fund new provision, acquisition of new equipment,
training resources and discrete interventions to support young people.

HETA has continued to deliver a significant number of training and education programmes to our different client groups
that have generated income to support the continued growth of the charity.

These include;

Level 3 & 4 Apprenticeships to both 16-18 and 19+ learners - £5,039k

Study Programme (Traineeships) for unsponsored learners - £220k

HE programmes - £521k

Adult upskilling courses for those already operating in the labour market - £906k
Other income streams - £723k

eoeeee

Overall income year on year is;
£7,409k 2023-24 against £6,241k 2022-23

In delivering these various activities, the company has generated an operating surplus of £915k- an income uplift of 19%
year on year-this reflects the strength in how our income streams have been diversified.

This surplus allows for continued investment in the current and future activities of the Charity; Investment in new assets
for the year was £698k.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND PERFORMANCE - continued

Additional Grant Funding
HETA was particularly successful in attracting new grants by participating in a key national initiative from the Department
of Education:

LSIPs and LSIFs

Local Skills Improvement Plans-LSIPs were conceived to define and set out the key priorities and changes needed in a local
area to make post 16 technical education or training more responsive and closely aligned to local labour market needs and
provide a representative and coherent employer view of the skills most needed to support local economic growth and boost
productivity, and improve employability and progression for learners.

The LSIF supports the reforms introduced in the skills for jobs white paper, providing investment in the technical skills
system to better support the needs of the local labour market and wider economy.

The Local Skills Improvement Fund was aligned to the LSIPS. The fund is being made available to collaborations of
FE/Post 16 providers to enable them to respond to the priorities in the Local Skills Improvement Plans (LSIPs).

The local skills improvement fund (LSIF) was designed to enable further education providers across a geographic area to
respond collectively to the priorities in the local skills improvement plans (LSIPs). The LSIPs were submitted by the
designated employer representative body for each area by 31 May 2023. For the Humber region these were the Hull and
Humber Chamber of Commerce and the Federation of Small Businesses.

HETA was successful in securing partner place in the LSIF Partnership for both Greater Lincolnshire and Hull and East
Yorkshire.

As an active partner, we secured vital capital and revenue funding totalling £850k-this has allowed us to invest in new
equipment that support curriculum developments and an improved learner experience.

HETA was able to secure additional funding from the LSIF which enabled us to make significant investments in new capital
equipment and new curriculum design.

Ann Watsons Trust
Established in the East Riding of Yorkshire, the Trust is now 300 years old making it one of the older charities in the United
Kingdom and to this day it continues to fulfil the charitable objectives of its founder Mrs Ann Watson.

Along with other charitable aims, the trust seeks to make grants for the advancement of education of young people under 25
years in Hull and the East Riding of Yorkshire.

In 1720, Ann Watson’s Will established a Trust to improve the educational opportunities of local children to improve their
employability and this remains a key objective of the Trust to this day.

All beneficiaries of a grant must be under 25 years of age, have lived in Hull or the East Riding of Yorkshire and be either
currently attending or have attended a school in that area for at least three years.

Funding was used to support our Traineeships. This group of learners follow a similar path of study to the paid apprentices
but receive no wage other than a small amount of money to reimburse travel costs.

In 2023/24, HETA successfully utilised the Ann Watson Trust funding to support 14 learners, achieving an incredible 100%
progression rate into employment and apprenticeships with prestigious companies such as Siemens, Reckitts, and Paragon
Toolmaking.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND PERFORMANCE - continued
The Ann Watson Trust has proved to be invaluable to learners, especially those from low-income families, providing

essential financial support to overcome barriers such as transport, equipment, and living costs. This assistance empowers
them to focus on their training, opening doors to life-changing opportunities in engineering careers.

Among these success stories:

e Kira made history as our first female unsponsored learner in the Fabrication and Welding Department, she used the
Ann Watson Trust to buy a small welding rig for home so she could practise her technique.

Alfie, now thriving in his role at Reckitts, used the trust to fund a laptop, enabling him to excel in his work, while
another learner relied on the funding for transport from the outskirts of Hull, ensuring consistent attendance and
commitment.

HETA has established a relationship with AWT and we are incredibly grateful for the support of the Trust’s staff and
Trustees.

During 2023-24, the Ann Watsons Trust made a contribution of £30k.

CHARITABLE ACTIVITIES

Fulfilling our charitable ethos - Getting Young People into Work and working with Schools

“HETA is a training provider and a Job Broker”.

Trainesships@HETA are a ‘cornerstone’ programme of teaching and learning and demonstrate our commitment to
developing young people and to ensure our client base can access high quality job applicants.

In 2023-24, HETA continued to secure employment for a significant number of young people acting as a recruiter for
employers. This approach essentially has two facets-Traineeships (Study Programmes) and Sponsored Apprenticeships.

Study Programmes are a specific funding stream from the Department for Education-for ease of understanding HETA
continues to refer to them as “Traineeships”.

The Traineeship is designed to act as a pathway into employment, an apprenticeship or further learning. The entry criteria
and delivery requirements are flexible.

HETA uses the Government's Study (Traineeship) Programme to widen participation and to ensure small to medium
employers can access suitable Apprenticeship candidates without having to commit to paying a whole year uf ‘uff the jub’
wages.

HETA is now into the 11th year of delivering on this programme and has adopted a model that is regarded as being
exemplary practice which sees young people being exposed to both trade and employability skills with progression into a
job.

The company receives a significantly lower funding amount that is far less than the core funding for an Advanced
Apprenticeship. We purposely deliver a much-enhanced learning experience that is not covered by the funding allocation.

In short, HETA over delivers in order to maximise employment opportunities for young people and to ensure that employers
have access to a talent pipeline.

The following data shows the successful outcome for the Trainceship programme at META:
« 45 out of 47 traineeships went on to a successful outcome - 96%.

e 37 out of 47 traineeships went on to an apprenticeship with HETA — 79%

Community Marketing & Support

Being part of the community is vital to HETA, reflecting our commitment to supporting and inspiring local initiatives. One
area was highlighting the synergy between sports and engineering—both demanding teamwork, precision, and
perseverance.

We proudly sponsored clubs such as Hull City Ladies, South Cave Under 7s, and Myton Warriors, with the Under 7s giving
back through charity work with a local foodbank.

Additionally, we collaborated with Grimsby NHS on an inspiring project to repurpose their smoking shelter into art

features, showcasing the creativity and problem-solving at the heart of engineering. These efforts demonstrate our
dedication to fostering community connections and driving positive change.

CHARITABLE ACTIVITIES - continued

Welfare for Learners and Staff

HETA seeks to deliver the best possible learning experience for young people, however our aim is to support our learners in
a more holistic manner. This includes support and education around physical and mental health. In some cases, we provide
financial support to buy uniform, IT kit and we manage the travel allowances for Study Programmes (Traineeships).

A number of staff have trained as Mental Health First Aiders and attend update sessions around MH issues so we can better
support learners.

As part of a more rounded approach to the future wellbeing of the younger learners, HETA self-funds and provides a
programme of information, training and counselling around the issues of;

© Diet

¢ Alcohol

« Drugs

e Mental health issues- we now have mental health ‘First Aiders’ embedded on each site

¢ Fitness

e¢ Team Working

¢ Communication Skills

¢ Safeguarding and the “Prevent” (from radicalisation) strategy

Our staff are HETA, they are our greatest asset and the investment in finding, recruiting, training and retaining the best
people remains a cornerstone of the business.

Our aim is that the employment conditions at HETA for existing and potential staff, is regarded as being good enough to
make us an “Employer of Choice”.

Terms of employment include;
© Salarics that arc competitive to the education sector
© Gencrous leave entitlement and support for those with caring responsibilities
© Private Health Cover
© Contributory pension scheme
© Life Insurance
e Salary sacrifice schemes
¢ Subsidised catering facilities
The recruitment market remains a challenge across most business sectors and HETA is no exception. The company is
mindful of normal ‘churn’ via retirements and resignations and as such adopted a more proactive approach to recruitment.

By utilising a range of tactics to recruit and to try and succession plan (for retirees) it has been possible to recruit some
excellent replacement staff. However, the increased use of external recruitment agencies has been a necessity resulting in

much higher expenditure on recruitment fees.

HETA continues to invest in staff development via structured Continuous Development Days, online training, teacher
training from Levels 3 to 5, external events, webinars etc.

The company also tries to balance worldoads with home commitments and aims to be a family friendly employer supporting
those with carer responsibilities.

STATEMENT OF TRUSTEES' RESPONSIBILITIES

The trustees (who are also the directors of Humberside Engineering Training Association Limited for the purposes of
company law) are responsible for preparing the Report of the Trustees and the financial statements in accordance with
applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

Company Jaw requires the trustees to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of
the state of affairs of the charitable company and of the incoming resources and application of resources, including the
income and expenditure, of the charitable company for that period. In preparing those financial statements, the trustees are
required to

- select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;

- observe the methods and principles in the Charity SORP;

- make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;

- state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and
explained in the financial statements;

- prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the charitable
company will continue in business.

The trustees are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the

financial position of the charitable company and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the

Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the charitable company and hence for taking

reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

In so far as the trustees are aware:

- there is no relevant audit information of which the charitable company's auditors are unaware; and

- the trustees have taken all steps that they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any relevant audit
information and to establish that the auditors are aware of that information.

AUDITORS

The auditors, Sadofskys, will be proposed for re-appointment at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.

Report of the Independent Auditors to the Members of

Humberside Engineering Training
Association Limited

Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of Humberside Engineering Training Association Limited (the 'parent charity’) and
its subsidiaries (together comprising the ‘charitable group’) for the year ended 31st August 2024 which comprise the
Consolidated Statement of Financial Activities, the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement and
notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. The financial reporting framework
that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

In our opinion the financial statements:

- give a true and fair view of the state of the charitable group's and parent charity’s affairs as at 31st August 2024 and of
the group’s incoming resources and application of resources, including its income and expenditure, for the year then
ended;

- have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and

- have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial
statements section of our report. We are independent of the charitable company in accordance with the ethical
requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard, and
we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Conclusions relating to going concern
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the trustees' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the
preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions
that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the charitable company's ability to continue as a going
concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the trustees with respect to going concern are described in the relevant
sections of this report.

Other information
The trustees are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the
Annual Report, other than the financial statements and our Report of the Independent Auditors thereon.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly
stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so,
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in
the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material
misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements
themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other
information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

- the information given in the Report of the Trustees for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared
is consistent with the financial statements; and

- the Report of the Trustees has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

Humberside Engineering Training
Association Limited

Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the charitable company and its environment obtained in the course of the
audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the Report of the Trustees.

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if,

in our opinion:

- adequate accounting records have not been kept or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches
not visited by us; or

- the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or

- certain disclosures of trustees’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or

- we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

Responsibilities of trustees

As explained more fully in the Statement of Trustees’ Responsibilities, the trustees (who are also the directors of the
charitable company for the purposes of company law) are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for
being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the trustees determine is necessary to
enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the trustees are responsible for assessing the charitable company's ability to continue
as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of
accounting unless the trustees either intend to liquidate the charitable company or to cease operations, or have no realistic
alternative but to do so.

Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue a Report of the Independent Auditors that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs
(UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic
decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below:

- Our approach to identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including fraud
and non-compliance with laws and regulations, was as follows:

- the engagement partner ensured that the engagement team collectively had the appropriate competence, capabilities and
skills to identify or recognise non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations;

- we identified the laws and regulations applicable to the company through discussions with directors and other
management, and from our commercial knowledge and experience of the charitable sector;

- we focused on specific laws and regulations which we considered may have a direct material effect on the financial
statements or the operations of the company, including the Companies Act 2006, UK tax legislation, and data
protection, anti-bribery, employment, environmental, health and safety legislation along with industry specific
regulations and requirements.

- we assessed the extent of compliance with the laws and regulations identified above through making enquiries of
management and inspecting legal correspondence; and

-  -identified laws and regulations were communicated within the audit team regularly and the team remained alert to
instances of non-compliance throughout the audit.

We assessed the susceptibility of the company's financial statements to material misstatement, including obtaining an
understanding of how fraud might occur, by:

- making enquiries of management as to where they considered there was susceptibility to fraud, their knowledge of

actual, suspected and alleged fraud; and
- considering the internal controls in place to mitigate risks of fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations.

Page 15

Report of the Independent Auditors to the Members of
Humberside Engineering Training ©

Association Limited
To address the risk of fraud through management bias and override of controls, we:

- performed analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships;

- tested journal entries to identify unusual transactions;

- assessed whether judgements and assumptions made in determining the accounting estimates set out in note 2 were
indicative of potential bias; and

- investigated the rationale behind significant or unusual transactions.

In response to the risk of irregularities and non-compliance with laws and regulations, we designed procedures which
included, but were not limited to:

- agreeing financial statement disclosures to underlying supporting documentation;

- reading the minutes of meetings of those charged with governance;

- enquiring of management as to actual and potential litigation and claims; and

- reviewing correspondence with HMRC, relevant regulators, and the company's legal advisors.

There are inherent limitations in our audit procedures described above. The more removed that laws and regulations are
from financial transactions, the less likely it is that we would become aware of non-compliance. Auditing standards also
limit the audit procedures required to identify non-compliance with laws and regulations to enquiry of the directors and
other management and the inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence, if any.

Material misstatements that arise due to fraud can be harder to detect than those that arise from error as they may involve
deliberate concealment or collusion.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting
Council's website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our Report of the Independent
Auditors.

Use of our report

This report is made solely to the charitable company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the charitable company's members
those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors' report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted
by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the charitable company and the charitable company's
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
for the year ended 31st August 2024

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of preparing the financial statements

The financial statements of the charitable company, which is a public benefit entity under FRS 102, have been
prepared in accordance with the Charities SORP (FRS 102) 'Accounting and Reporting by Charities: Statement of
Recommended Practice applicable to charities preparing their accounts in accordance with the Financial Reporting
Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland (FRS 102) (effective 1 January 2019)’, Financial Reporting
Standard 102 'The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland’ and the Companies
Act 2006. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, with the exception of
investments which are included at market value.

Basis of consolidation
The group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the charity and its subsidiary undertaking,
Humberside Apprentice Training Agency Limited, at 31 August 2024 using acquisition accounting.

Income

Income from resources from charitable activities

Incoming resources from charitable activities excludes value added tax. Where income resources are dependent
upon the Charity delivering a service, the income is not recognised until the service is delivered.

Donations
Donations and gifts are included in full in the Statement of Financial Activities when receivable.

Grants
Grants and allowances receivable are accounted for as income in the year in which entitlement arises.

Gifts
Gifts in kind are valued by reference to the equivalent commercial cost of acquiring such assets or services.

Expenditure

Liabilities are recognised as expenditure as soon as there is a legal or constructive obligation committing the charity
to that expenditure, it is probable that a transfer of economic benefits will be required in settlement and the amount
of the obligation can be measured reliably. Expenditure is accounted for on an accruals basis and has been classified
under headings that aggregate all cost related to the category. Where costs cannot be directly attributed to particular
headings they have been allocated to activities on a basis consistent with the use of resources.

Allocation and apportionment of costs
Expenses directly associated with the delivery of training are charged as direct charitable expenses and split between
those relating to unrestricted and those relating to restricted funds.

Depreciation is split between restricted and unrestricted funds by reference to the charge arising on each specific
asset.

Employees are categorized as either directly involved in training or administration and related costs apportioned
accordingly. Staff time spent delivering projects which are subject to restricted funding is recharged from
unrestricted funds at agreed hourly rates.

Direct costs not capable of being attributed to any individual class of activity are apportioned according to te relative
income of each activity. Support costs are apportioned according to the amount of direct cost associated with each
class of activity. Governance costs reflect the strategic and compliance costs of the charity including an allowance
for the Chief Executive's time spent on such matters.

Tangible fixed assets
Depreciation is provided at the following annual rates in order to write off each asset over its estimated useful life.

Freehold property - 20% on cost, 10% on cost and 2% on cost
Plant and machinery - 10% on cost

Fixtures and fittings - 10% on cost

Computer equipment - 20% on cost

Taxation

As a registered charity, the company is generally exempt from Corporation Tax, but not from VAT. The company
accounts for VAT in accordance with the regulations relevant to the nature of the supplies which is makes. Any
irrecoverable VAT is shown separately as an expense.

Fund accounting

Incoming resources for services where, upon full performance of the service, any surplus can be retained and used
for general purposes are classified as unrestricted, whereas if any surplus is receivable by the donor then the
resources are classed as restricted.

Leases
Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to the Statement of Financial Activities on a straight line basis over

the period of the lease.

Rents payable and receivable under operating leases are charged to the SoFA on a straight line basis over the period
of the lease.
