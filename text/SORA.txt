Notes to the Financial Statements

Year ended 31 July 2023

General information

The company is a private company limited by shares, registered in England and Wales. The
address of the registered office is 3 Merchant Court, Monkton Business Park South, Hebburn,
Tyne and Wear, NE31 2EX.

Statement of compliance

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 102 "The Financial
Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of freland" ("FRS 102") and the
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies subject to the small
companies regime. The disclosure requirements of section 1A of FRS 102 have been applied

General Information

Sora Services Limited's principal activity during the year continued to be educational consultancy
services.

The company is a private company limited by shares and is incorporated and domiciled in
England. :

Accounting policies
Basis of preparation

The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, as modified by the
revaluation of certain financial assets and liabilities.

The financial statements are prepared in sterling, which is the functional currency of the entity.
Going concern

The company meets its day-to-day working capital requirements through its bank facilities. The
company's forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading
performance, show that the company should be able to operate within the level of its current
facilities. After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the company
has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. The
company therefore continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its financial
statements.

Debtors

Trade and other debtors are recognised at the settlement amount due after any trade discount
offered. Prepayments are valued at the amount prepaid net of any trade discounts due.

Cash at bank in hand
Cash at bank and cash in hand includes cash and short term highly liquid investments with a

short maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition or opening of the deposit or
similar account.

Accounting policies (continued)
Creditors

' Creditors are recognised where the company has a present obligation resulting from a past event
that will probably result in the transfer of funds to a third party and the amount due to settle the
obligation can be measured or estimated reliably. Creditors are normally recognised at their
settlement after allowing for any trade discounts due.

Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty

The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgements,
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. These estimates and judgements
are continually reviewed and are based on experience and other factors, including expectations
of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

Revenue recognition

Turnover is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents
amounts receivable for services rendered, stated net of discounts.

Taxation

The taxation expense represents the aggregate amount of current and deferred tax recognised in
the reporting period. Tax is recognised in profit or loss, except to the extent that it relates to items
recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, tax is recognised in
other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.

Current tax is recognised on taxable profit for the current and past periods. Current tax is
measured at the amounts of tax expected to pay or recover using the tax rates and laws that
have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences at the reporting date. Unrelieved
tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that they
will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.
Deferred tax is measured using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the reporting date that are expected to apply to the reversal of the timing difference.

Operating leases

Lease payments are recognised as an expense over the lease term on a straight-line basis. The
aggregate benefit of lease incentives is recognised as a reduction to expense over the lease
term, on a straight-line basis.

Tangible assets

Tangible assets are initially recorded at cost, and subsequently stated at cost less any
accumulated depreciation and impairment tosses. Any tangible assets carried at revalued
amounts are recorded at the fair value at the date of revaluation less any subsequent
accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses.

Sora Services Limited
Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)

Year ended 31 July 2023

Accounting policies (continued)
Tangible assets (continued)

An increase in the carrying amount of an asset as a result of a revaluation, is recognised in other
comprehensive income and accumulated in equity, except to the extent it reverses a revaluation
decrease of the same asset previously recognised in profit or loss. A decrease in the carrying
amount of an asset as a result of revaluation, is recognised in other comprehensive income to
the extent of any previously recognised revaluation increase accumulated in equity in respect of
that asset. Where a revaluation decrease exceeds the accumulated revaluation gains
accumulated in equity in respect of that asset, the excess shall be recognised in profit or loss.

Depreciation

Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost or valuation of an asset, less its residual
value, over the useful economic life of that asset as follows:

Freehold property - 2% straight line
Fixtures and fittings - 25% straight line
Motor vehicles - 25% reducing balance
Equipment - 25% straight fine

impairment of fixed assets

A review for indicators of impairment is carried out at each reporting date, with the recoverable
amount being estimated where such indicators exist. Where the carrying value exceeds the
recoverable amount, the asset is impaired accordingly. Prior impairments are also reviewed for
possible reversal at each reporting date.

For the purposes of impairment testing, when it is not possible to estimate the recoverable
amount of an individual asset, an estimate is made of the recoverable amount of the
cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. The cash-generating unit is the smallest
identifiable group of assets that includes the asset and generates cash inflows that are largely
independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.

Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the entity has an obligation at the reporting date as a result of a
past event, it is probable that the entity will be required to transfer economic benefits in
settlement and the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably. Provisions are recognised
as a liability in the statement of financial position and the amount of the provision as an expense.

Provisions are initially measured at the best estimate of the amount required to settle the
obligation at the reporting date and subsequently reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted
to reflect the current best estimate of the amount that would be required to settle the obligation.
Any adjustments to the amounts previously recognised are recognised in profit or loss unless the
provision was originally recognised as part of the cost of an asset. When a provision is measured
at the present value of the amount expected to be required to settle the obligation, the unwinding
of the discount is recognised as a finance cost in profit or loss in the period it arises.

Accounting policies (continued)
Financial instruments

A financial asset or a financial liability is recognised only when the entity becomes a party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument.

Basic financial instruments are initially recognised at the transaction price, unless the
arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where it is recognised at the present value of
the future payments discounted at a market rate of interest for a similar debt instrument.

Debt instruments are subsequently measured at amortised cost.

Defined contribution plans

Contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as an expense in the period in which
the related service is provided. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent
that the prepayment will lead to a reduction in future payments or a cash refund.

When contributions are not expected to be settled wholly within 12 months of the end of the
reporting date in which the employees render the related service, the liability is measured on a
discounted present value basis. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as a finance cost in
profit or loss in the period in which it arises.

Employee numbers

The average number of persons employed by the company during the year amounted to 16
(2022: 17).
