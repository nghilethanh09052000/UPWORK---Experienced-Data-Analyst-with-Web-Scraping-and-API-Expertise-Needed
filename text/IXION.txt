Director’s Statement

It has been a challenging few years for Ixion, with a reduction in activities triggered
by the pandemic, and still feeding through. | am however pleased that despite the
financial loss this year, over 5,000 beneficiaries have been supported.

The focus of the Company during the year has been to retrench, focussing on core
alliances and collaborations to support improved margins and potential growth into
the future.

Though a difficult year, this only makes me more grateful for the hard work of the
team and for the ongoing efforts in pivoting the organisation.

Strategic Report

The directors present their strategic report on the company for the year ended 31
August 2024.

1. Company Overview, Principal Activities and Objectives

Our Mission

Ixion Holdings (Contracts) Ltd (Ixion) is a leading provider of skills training, including
the delivery of apprenticeships, traineeships, adult learning, and ex-offender
rehabilitation. Ixion also supported commercial clients (in consortia) across Europe to
win innovation and research funding from the European Union (EU) and Innovate
UK, albeit a decision to close this part of the offering has been taken in FY24/25.

The Company’s revenue streams in the year include Government Departments such
as: The Education Skills Funding Agency (EFSA); the European Social Fund (ESF);
the Ministry of Justice (MOJ); the EU and Local Authorities.

Ixion is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Shaw Trust, a national! charity that helps -
individuals facing barriers to work and social inclusion to achieve their full potential.
Ixion is pleased to support Shaw Trust in providing skills and training as part of the
charitable mission as an Ofsted graded ‘good’ Provider.

Our Strategy and the Market

With the introduction of Skills England, the skills sector is poised for significant
evolution. Ixion has therefore been focussed on preparing for this potential shift in
the market. The recent announcement of Foundation Apprenticeships underscores
the importance of remaining in the skills domain and as an Apprenticeship Levy
provider.

The focus for the business is on consolidation of training / offered standards into the
areas that provide best overlap between impact and margin. In addition to this, Ixion
continues to focus on the increasingly sophisticated needs of employers, with a
focus on developing core partnerships to better tailor and match the supply and
demand of skills services.

Our Objectives for the Coming Year and Future Developments
We plan to:

. Leverage into new markets and customers while continuing to consolidate our
current offering.

° Act with agility, prepared to respond to Labour's new plans for the sector.
e Return to a surplus within the next three-years.

e Continue to demonstrate our value to the market, evidenced in particular
through a strong Ofsted rating.

Ixion Holdings (Contracts) Limited 6

Our Values
Our values mirror that of Shaw Trust and the wider Group. Our values are:

. We care about people. We ensure a safe environment, ensuring that we
promote the safeguarding of our beneficiaries, this includes for example safer
recruitment, safeguarding procedures, whistleblowing, training etc. Safety
issues are considered in everything we do. It is essential that Health and
Safety is a priority for each and every employee.

° We make a difference. We demonstrate the utmost care and respect for those
people whose welfare and safety are entrusted to us, while providing high
quality services that achieve positive and sustainable results for our
beneficiaries.

. We are inclusive. We take care to employ the best people, develop their skills,
knowledge and experience, provide opportunities and inspire them to contribute
to our success.

. We are collaborative. We work with staff, beneficiaries and stakeholders to
identify emerging needs, trends and the best way to innovate and improve our
services.

. We are honest. We seek to be trusted to do the right thing and have a training
and risk management environment that follows regulatory and market best
practice to uphold this trust.

EBITDA is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation.
Revenue

Revenue for the year to 31 August 2024 was £11.2m, a reduction of £3.6m from the
previous year tota! of £14.8m. The prior year included £1.1m business interruption
insurance income (BIl) as well as the full year for multiple contracts which then came
to an end during the year ended 31 August 2024. The Director's Statement on page
4 provides more information on contract performance in the year.

Ixion Holdings (Contracts) Limited 7

EBITDA

EBITDA, being earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, is used
as a consistent measure of business performance year on year. The EBITDA margin
decreased from a negative 1.2% in FY23 to negative 1.4% in the year, partly
attributable to the impact of BIl in the prior year, and also as a result of restructuring
and re-provisioning in FY24 to support improved margins and potential growth into
the future.

Balance Sheet

The Company’s overall net assets at 31 August 2024 were £0.6m (2023: £0.1m) which
included net amounts owed by all fellow group undertakings amounting to £0.0m
(2023: £0.5m).

The Company's overall cash position increased by £0.1m in the year to £2.4m
reflecting a capital injection of £2m less operating losses for the year.

Amounts owed by customers and owed to suppliers have remained consistent year
on year. However, deferred income balances have reduced following the end of a
contract during the year where income had been paid up front.

The Company maintains an adequate level of reserves to continue operations for the
foreseeable future. The Board are consolidating the offering and have planned for
continued growth and development of the organisation in order to continue to support
Shaw Trust in delivering on their mission and vision.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The company operates a diverse set of contracts, each containing their own KPIs and
targets that are monitored through a detailed Operational Review process i.e. regular
review meetings with the contract managers to ensure that the resources being
expended on delivering the contracts are generating the required outcomes and
revenue.

Financial performance also is monitored on a monthly basis, including but not limited
to the key elements such as revenue, operating profit, adjusted earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation and adjusted profit / (loss) before tax. Cash
is monitored and forecast by Group treasury, maximising a low-risk financial return
through cash deposits while ensuring sufficient liquidity to pay stakeholders in a timely
manner without risk.

3. Principal Risks and Uncertainties
Our approach to risk management

Risk is an accepted and necessary part of carrying on our business and we rely
upon our risk management processes to appropriately balance risks against
rewards. The Board has overall responsibility for risk management and internal
control and the executive directors ensure that risk management plans are
effectively communicated throughout the organisation.

Ixion Holdings (Contracts) Limited

The Board of Ixion are guided by and provide reports to the Trustee Board of
Shaw Trust.

The identification, evaluation and monitoring of significant risks is a continuous
process. The Trustee Board are responsible for setting the tone and influencing
the culture of risk management within the Group, including the attitude to risk
and the monitoring of new risks. The Trustee Board reviews new and existing
risks, challenges risk ratings and assesses the effectiveness of internal
controls. It also considers whether other risks should be reviewed and advises
management accordingly.

Through the Group’s Executive Management Team, Audit and Risk Committee
and the Ixion Board, the financial and risk management processes enable
Trustees to discharge their responsibilities toward risk and responsibilities
management by:

° The adoption of a range of policies and procedures to enable risk
management including a risk management policy, an anti-fraud policy, a
whistleblowing policy, and a registration of interests policy;

° The maintenance of a corporate risk register, which is used to monitor
the risk environment of the Company and to inform audit plans;

° The establishment and maintenance of the ‘three lines of defence’ model of
internal control:

° Line one: management controls to prevent, detect and respond to
exposure to risk. These include organisational structures that enable
segregation of duties, the implementation of security protocols in
respect of assets and information, pre-employment checks and
ongoing training, supplemented by management supervision and
checking arrangements;

° Line two: risk management through the development,
implementation, testing and maintenance of an effective control and
governance environment. In addition, an internal team provides
assurance in respect of the quality-of-service provision and
compliance withlegislation, contractual requirements, and relevant
standards. The Trust’s Line Two reports into senior management
and the Trustee Board, through the Audit and Risk Committee; and

° Line three: internal Audit which is performed by an outsourced
provider. Reporting primarily to the Audit and Risk Committee, the
internal auditors provide assurance over the effectiveness of
corporate governance and the overall control environment including
the line two defences. All reports identifyareas of strength and good
practice along with areas for improvement. In the case of the latter,
the Audit and Risk Committee monitors a time-based log of
improvement actions, agreed by the management and the auditors,
to ensure that they are implemented.

company for the year ended 31 August 2024. This report contains the statutory
information disclosed in addition to that set out in the Strategic Report.

Review of the business

The financial results of the Company are detailed in the income statement on
page 19. Further information on the business performance is detailed on pages 5
to 10 of the Strategic Report.

Directors
The directors who were in post during the year and since the year end were:

R W Clifton
M L Nussbaum
J E Robertson

Directors’ indemnities

As permitted by the Articles of Association, the directors have the benefit of an
indemnity which is a qualifying third-party indemnity provision as defined by
Section 234 of the Companies Act 2006. The indemnity was in force throughout the
last financial year and is currently in force. The Company also purchased and
maintained throughout the financial year Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance
in respect of itself and its directors.

Financial risk management objectives and policies

The Company is exposed to financial risk through its financial assets and liabilities,
such as loans, cash balances, pension liabilities, trade debtors and trade creditors that
arise directly from its operations. The key financial risk is that the proceeds from
financial assets are not sufficient to fund the obligations arising from the financial
liabilities as they fall due. The most important components of financial risk to the
Company are interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. Further details on these
risks are set out in note 20 to the financial statements.

Employment policies

We seek to attract, develop, and retain high calibre staff to ensure the delivery of a
high-quality service to our customers.

Equality, diversity, and inclusion

As an employer, we are committed to promoting equality, diversity and inclusion
throughout the Company by valuing and encouraging diversity in our workforce
and providing equality of opportunity for all. We are committed to delivering best
practice in relation to our obligations under the Equality Act 2010. We work to
ensure our employees and job applicants are treated equally regardless of their
sex, race, ethnicity, disability, age, religion or belief, sexual or gender orientation.

Ixion Holdings (Contracts) Limited 12

The Company’s commitment to equality, diversity and inclusion is reflected in all
our recruitment and employment policies, practices, and procedures.

As a service provider, we are committed to promoting equality, diversity and
inclusion as an integral part of all our services. We aim to provide services which
are responsive and accessible to all, meet the needs of the protected groups and
enable our service users to fulfil their potential free from discrimination of any
kind. As a contractor of services, we will work only with organisations that can
demonstrate a clear equalitycommitment to their workforce and service users.

Disabled employees

The Company gives full and fair consideration to applications for employment from
disabled persons, having regard to their particular aptitudes and abilities.

Appropriate arrangements are made for the continued employment and training,
career development and promotion of disabled persons employed by the Company. If
members of staff become disabled the Company continues employment, either in the
same or an alternative position, with appropriate retraining being given if necessary.

Employee involvement

The Company systematically provides employees with information on matters of
concern to them, consulting them or their representatives regularly, so that their views
can be taken into account when making decisions that are likely to affect them.

Employee involvement in the Company is encouraged, as. achieving a common
awareness on the part of all employees of the financial and economic factors affecting
the Company plays a major role in maintaining and growing its position.

The Company encourages the involvement of employees through a forum where
employees are represented by elected colleagues on a regional basis who meet
regularly with the Executive Management Team.

Health and safety

The Company is committed to safeguarding the health, safety and welfare of its
employees and recognises its responsibilities for the health and safety of others
who may be affected by its activities.

Environmental policies

The Company recognises that the wise use of resources delivers both
environmental and financial benefits. As part of our overall approach to corporate
social responsibility we aim to promote the maintenance of a healthy environment
through responsible and sustainable consumption. The Company is part of a
group that has a strategy to tackle climate change and reduce overall carbon
footprint including procurement of electricity from renewable sources, use of low
energy lighting, renewable technology vehicles, and properties with an EPC rating
of C or above.

Ixion Holdings (Contracts) Limited 13

Streamlined energy and carbon reporting

The Company is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Shaw Trust Limited which has
reported full details of the Group’s energy consumption under the Streamlined
Energy and Carbon Reporting (SECR) regulations. The Company has therefore not
included details required under the SECR regulations within these financial
statements.

Statement of directors’ responsibilities in respect of the financial statements

The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial
statements in accordance with applicable law and regulation.

Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial
year. Under that law the directors have prepared the financial statements in
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United
Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 102 “The Financial Reporting
Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland”, and applicable law).

Under company law, directors must not approve the financial statements unless they
are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company
and of the profit or loss of the company for that period. In preparing the financial
statements, the directors are required to:

° select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;

° state whether applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising
FRS 102 have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed
and explained in the financial statements;

° make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
and :

. prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is
inappropriate to presume that the company will continue in business.

The directors are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other
irregularities.

The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are
sufficient to show and explain the company’s transactions and disclose with
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and enable
them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006.

The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the company’s
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Ixion Holdings (Contracts) Limited 14

e so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which
the company’s auditors are unaware; and

° they have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as a director in
order to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to
establish that the company’s auditors are aware of that information.

Independent Auditor’s Report to the Members of Ixion Holdings
(Contracts) Limited

Opinion

We have audited the financia! statements of Ixion Holdings (Contracts) Limited for
the year ended 31 August 2024 which comprise the Statement of Comprehensive
Income, Balance Sheet, Statement of Changes in Equity and notes to the financial
statements, including significant accounting policies. The financial reporting
framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United
Kingdom Accounting Standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 102 The
Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland (United
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

In our opinion, the financial statements:

) give a true and fair view of the state of the company’s affairs as at 31 August
2024 and of its loss for the year then ended;

. have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice;

° have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act
2006.

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK)
(ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are
further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial
statements section of our report. We are independent of the company in accordance
with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements
in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other
ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the
audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for
our opinion.

Conclusions relating to going concern

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the
going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is
appropriate.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material
uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may
cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going concern for a
period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised
for issue.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going
concern are described in the relevant sections of this report.

\xion Holdings (Contracts) Limited ; 16

Other information

The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual
report. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report,
other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. Our opinion on
the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the
extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of
assurance conclusion thereon.

Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether
the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our
knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If
we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are
required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the
financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we
conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are
required to report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion based on the work undertaken in the course of our audit

e the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the
financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent
with the financial statements; and

e the strategic report and the directors' report have been prepared in
accordance with applicable legal requirements.

Matters on which we are required to report by exception

In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment
obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in
the strategic report or the directors’ report.

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the
Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:

e adequate accounting records have not been kept by the company, or returns
adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by
us; or

e the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and
returns; or

e certain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made;
or

« we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our
audit.

Ixion Holdings (Contracts) Limited 17

Responsibilities of directors

As explained more fully in the statement of directors’ responsibilities set out on page
13, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and
for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as
the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the
company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters
related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the
directors either intend to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or have no
realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or
error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit
conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement
when it exists.

Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if,
individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

Extent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including
fraud

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and
regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to
detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent
to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is
detailed below:

We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks within which
the company operates, focusing on those laws and regulations that have a direct
effect on the determination of material amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. The laws and regulations we considered in this context were the
Companies Act 2006, together with the FRS 102. We assessed the required
compliance with these laws and regulations as part of our audit procedures on the
related financial statement items.

In addition, we considered provisions of other laws and regulations that do not have
a direct effect on the financial statements but compliance with which might be
fundamental to the company’s ability to operate or to avoid a material penalty. We
also considered the opportunities and incentives that may exist within the company
for fraud. The laws and regulations we considered in this context for the UK
operations were General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Employment
legislation and Ofsted regulations.

\xion Holdings (Contracts) Limited 18

Auditing standards limit the required audit procedures to identify non-compliance
with these laws and regulations to enquiry of the Directors and other management
and inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence, if any.

We identified the greatest risk of material impact on the financial statements from
irregularities, including fraud, to be within the timing of recognition of income and the
override of controls by management. Our audit procedures to respond to these risks
included enquiries of management about their own identification and assessment of
the risks of irregularities, sample testing on the posting of journals, reviewing
accounting estimates for biases, reviewing regulatory correspondence, and reading
minutes of meetings of those charged with governance. Our audit procedures to
respond to revenue recognition risks included testing a sample of revenue across the
year agreeing to supporting documentation to ensure that it has been recognised in
the correct period.

Owing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk that we may
not have detected some material misstatements in the financial statements, even
though we have properly planned and performed our audit in accordance with
auditing standards. We are not responsible for preventing non-compliance and
cannot be expected to detect non-compliance with all laws and regulations.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is
available on the Financial Reporting Council's website at:
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor's
report.

Use of our report

This report is made solely to the company's members, as a body, in accordance with
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been
undertaken so that we might state to the company's members those matters we are
required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone
other than the company and the company's members as a body, for our audit work,
for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Annual report and accounts for the year ended 31 August 2024

1 General information

Ixion Holdings (Contracts) Limited (the “Company”) is a private limited company,
limited by shares, and is domiciled in England and Wales with registration number
06886337. The address of its registered office is Black Country House, Rounds Green
Road, Oldbury, B69 2DG.

2 Accounting policies
Basis of preparation of financial statements

The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, under the
historical cost convention and in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102,
the Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and the Republic of Ireland and
the Companies Act 2006.

The preparation of financial statements in compliance with FRS 102 requires the use
of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise
judgement in applying the Company's accounting policies (see note 3).

The Company has taken advantage of the exemption provided by Section 400 of the
Companies Act 2006 not to prepare group financial statements, as it is a subsidiary
undertaking of The Shaw Trust Limited, a company registered in the United Kingdom
and is included in the consolidated financial statements of that company. A copy of
these financial statements may be obtained from Black Country House, Rounds Green
Road, Oldbury, B69 2DG

The Company has adopted the following disclosure exemptions:
e the requirement under Section 7 to present a statement of cash flows and related
notes.
e the requirement under Section 11, financial instrument disclosures, including:
- categories of financial instruments,

- items of income, expenses, gains or losses relating to financial instruments,
and

- exposure to and management of financial risks.

e the requirement-under Section 33 to disclose related party transactions with other
wholly owned group companies.

The following principal accounting policies have been applied consistently throughout
the year:

Going concern

The ultimate parent and controlling party, Shaw Trust Limited (The), has indicated that
it will continue to provide financial support to the Company. The directors therefore
have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, the directors
continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.

Foreign currency translation
The Company's functional and presentational currency is GBP.
Turnover

Turnover is measured as the fair value of the consideration received or receivable,
excluding discounts, rebates, value added tax, and other sales taxes.

Turnover is recognised in accordance with the terms of the contract and performance
criteria set out in the contract. Accrued income arises when revenues have been
generated in advance of the stipulated invoice dates. Deferred income arises where
invoices have been raised in accordance with the contracted terms, but where the
revenue has not been earned.

Turnover also includes amounts due from group undertakings relating to management
fees for services provided during the period.

Operating leases: The Company as lessee

Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to the Statement of Comprehensive
Income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Pensions
The Company operated a defined contribution plan for its employees.

Contributions are recognised as an expense in the Statement of Comprehensive
Income when they fall due. Amounts not paid are shown as accruals as a liability in
the Balance Sheet. The assets of the plan are held separately from the Company in
independently administered funds.

Current tax

Tax is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income, except that a charge
attributable to an item of income and expense recognised as other comprehensive
income or to an item recognised directly in equity is also recognised in other
comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.

Tangible assets

Tangible assets under the cost model are stated at historical cost less accumulated
depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Historical cost includes
expenditure that is directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and
condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by
management.

Depreciation is charged so as to allocate the cost of assets less their residual value
over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method.

Ixion Holdings (Contracts) Limited 24
Annual report and accounts for the year ended 31 August 2024

Depreciation is provided on the following basis:

Motor Vehicles 20% straight line
Fixtures and fittings 20% straight line
Office equipment 20% straight line
Computer equipment 25% straight line

The assets’ residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and
adjusted prospectively if appropriate, or if there is an indication of a significant change
since the last reporting date.

Gain and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the
carrying amount and are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Assets costing less than £3,000 are not capitalised.

Financial instruments

The Company only enters into basic financial instrument transactions that result in the
recognition of financial assets and liabilities like trade and other debtors and creditors.

Debtors
Short-term debtors are measured at transaction price, less any impairment.
Cash and cash equivalents

These comprise cash at bank and other short-term highly liquid bank deposits with an
original maturity of three months or less.

Creditors
Short-term creditors are measured at the transaction price.
Provisions for liabilities

Provisions are charged as an expense to the Statement of Comprehensive Income in
the year that the Company becomes aware of the obligation, and are measured at the
best estimate at the Balance Sheet date of the expenditure required to settle the
obligation, taking into account relevant risks and uncertainties.

3 Judgements in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation
uncertainty

Preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgments,
estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that
are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and assumptions are
based on experience and other factors that are considered relevant. Actual results
may differ from these estimates.

Ixion Holdings (Contracts) Limited 25
Annual report and accounts for the year ended 31 August 2024

Ixion Holdings (Contracts) Limited recognises accrued income as at the balance sheet
date based upon the assertion that sufficient delivery of the contract has been
completed for them to be entitled to the income. However, these are currently
insignificant.

Trade debtor balances as at the balance sheet date are deemed recoverable based
upon judgements made on the capability of customers to repay the balance and the
probability that they will do so.

20 Financial risk management

The Company is exposed to financial risk through its financial assets and liabilities, such
as loans, cash balances, trade debtors and trade creditors that arise directly from its
operations. The key financial risk is that the proceeds from financial assets are not
sufficient to fund the obligations arising from the financial liabilities as they fall due. The
most important components of financial risk to the Company are interest rate risk, credit
risk and liquidity risk.

Credit risk

The Company’s principal financial assets are cash and trade debtors. The credit risk
associated with cash is limited as the Company cash balances are primarily held with
UK financial institutions with high credit ratings assigned by credit-rating agencies. The
credit risk associated with trade debtors is limited due to the nature of the main
counterparties being local authorities, the Education and Skills Funding Agency and
other Government agencies.

Liquidity risk

The Company seeks to manage liquidity risk by ensuring that sufficient cash resources
are available to meet the foreseeable needs of the business.
