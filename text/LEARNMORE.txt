Notes to the Financial Statements
for the Period 1 November 2023 to 31 July 2024
1.
STATUTORY INFORMATION
Learnmore Skills Limited is a
private company, limited by shares
, registered in England and Wales. The
company's registered number and registered office address can be found on the Company Information
page.
The presentation currency of the financial statements is the Pound Sterling (£).
2.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of preparing the financial statements
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102 "The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland" including the provisions of Section 1A "Small Entities" and the Companies Act 2006. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.
Revenue
Revenue is measured at fair value and represents revenues receivable under contracts net of value added
tax. Where contractual obligations have been partially performed at the balance sheet date, revenue is
recognised to the extent that the company has obtained the right to consideration through its
performance.
Tangible fixed assets
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost or valuation of an asset, less its residual value, over
their estimated useful lives as follows:
Computer equipment - 33% on cost
On disposal, the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the item sold is
recognised in the income statement.
Taxation
Taxation for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Income Statement,
except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
Current or deferred taxation assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Current tax is recognised at the amount of tax payable using the tax rates and laws that have been
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the
balance sheet date.
Timing differences arise from the inclusion of income and expenses in tax assessments in periods different
from those in which they are recognised in financial statements. Deferred tax is measured using tax rates
and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the period end and that are expected to
apply to the reversal of the timing difference.
Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that
they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.
