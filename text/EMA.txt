Notes to the financial statements

Year ended 30 January 2024

1. General information

The company is a private company limited by shares, registered in England and Wales. The address of the
registered office is Progress House, 4 Siddals Road, Derby, DE1 2PW.

2. Statement of compliance

These financial statements have been prepared in compliance with the provisions of FRS 102, Section 1A, 'The
Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland’.

3. Accounting policies

Basis of preparation

The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, as modified by the revaluation of certain
financial assets and liabilities and investment properties measured at fair value through profit or loss.

The financial statements are prepared in sterling, which is the functional currency of the entity.
Turnover

Turnover is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods supplied and services
rendered, net of discounts and Value Added Tax.

Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have transferred
to the buyer (usually on despatch of the goods); the amount of revenue can be measured reliably; it is probable that
the associated economic benefits will flow to the entity; and the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the
transactions can be measured reliably.

Taxation

The taxation expense represents the aggregate amount of current and deferred tax recognised in the reporting
period. Tax is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income, except to the extent that it relates to items
recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in capital and reserves. In this case, tax is recognised in
other comprehensive income or directly in capital and reserves, respectively. Current tax is recognised on taxable
profit for the current and past periods. Current tax is measured at the amounts of tax expected to pay or recover
using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences at the reporting date. Unrelieved tax losses and other
deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered against the reversal
of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits. Deferred tax is measured using the tax rates and laws that
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date that are expected to apply to the reversal of the
timing difference.

Tangible assets

tangible assets are initially recorded at cost, and are subsequently stated at cost less any accumulated
depreciation and impairment losses. Any tangible assets carried at revalued amounts are recorded at the fair value
at the date of revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment
losses. An increase in the carrying amount of an asset as a result of a revaluation, is recognised in other
comprehensive income and accumulated in capital and reserves, except to the extent it reverses a revaluation
decrease of the same asset previously recognised in profit or loss. A decrease in the carrying amount of an asset
as a result of revaluation is recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent of any previously recognised
revaluation increase accumulated in capital and reserves in respect of that asset. Where a revaluation decrease
exceeds the accumulated revaluation gains accumulated in capital and reserves in respect of that asset, the
excess shall be recognised in profit or loss.

Depreciation

Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost or valuation of an asset, less its residual value, over the useful
economic life of that asset as follows:

Computer equipment - 33.3 % straight line
Fittings fixtures and equipment - 25 % reducing balance

If there is an indication that there has been a significant change in depreciation rate, useful life or residual value of
tangible assets, the depreciation is revised prospectively to reflect the new estimates.

Impairment

A review for indicators of impairment is carried out at each reporting date, with the recoverable amount being
estimated where such indicators exist. Where the carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount, the asset is
impaired accordingly. Prior impairments are also reviewed for possible reversal at each reporting date. When it is
not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, an estimate is made of the recoverable
amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. The cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable
group of assets that includes the asset and generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows
from other assets or groups of assets.

Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the entity has an obligation at the reporting date as a result of a past event; it is
probable that the entity will be required to transfer economic benefits in settlement and the amount of the obligation
can be estimated reliably. Provisions are recognised as a liability in the statement of financial position and the
amount of the provision as an expense. Provisions are initially measured at the best estimate of the amount
required to settle the obligation at the reporting date and subsequently reviewed at each reporting date and
adjusted to reflect the current best estimate of the amount that would be required to settle the obligation. Any
adjustments to the amounts previously recognised are recognised in profit or loss unless the provision was
originally recognised as part of the cost of an asset. When a provision is measured at the present value of the
amount expected to be required to settle the obligation, the unwinding of the discount is recognised in finance costs
in profit or loss in the period it arises.

Defined contribution plans

Contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as an expense in the period in which the related service
is provided. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that the prepayment will lead to a
reduction in future payments or a cash refund. When contributions are not expected to be settled wholly within 12
months of the end of the reporting date in which the employees render the related service, the liability is measured
ona discounted present value basis. The unwinding of the discount is recognised in finance costs in profit or loss in
the period in which it arises.

4. Employee numbers

The average number of persons employed by the company during the year amounted to Nil (2023: 36 ).
