STRATEGIC REPORT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2024
- 1 -
The directors have pleasure in presenting their report and the financial statements of the company for the
year
ended 31 August 2024.
Fair review of the business
The company previously changed its year
end to 31 August to align with their parent company and is therefore presenting its first full year accounts with the new year
end, for the year
ended 31 August 2024. Year
on
year comparisons are distorted not only by the change in accounting period, but also by the
period not including the business’
peak period of seasonality from September to December. Revenue declined on a comparable basis due to the company’s decision to withdraw from the Skills Bootcamp programme in February 2024 due to challenges with the placement of learners into employment after they had completed the training programme. Revenue from continuing operations increased by 5% on a comparable basis.
The business continued to carefully monitor its cost base in line with adjusted activity levels, and was able to take advantage of synergies following its acquisition by the BPP Education Group, improving profitability on continuing operations by over 100% on a like-for-like basis by integrating and restructuring the Apprenticeships operations, whilst continuing to ensure that the quality of its training provision remains high
.
Financial risk management objectives
The company draws its revenues from a broad base of customers and there is no concentrated or specific risk in one customer cancelling orders or ceasing to trade.
The company monitors its sales and delivery of courses closely, ensuring that courses are run on an economic basis whilst meeting the company's revenue and volume targets.
The company has a relatively flexible cost model and is able to respond to changes in demand as soon as they are identified.
Cash collections are constantly monitored and the majority of customer payments are received in advance of course attendance. The company carefully monitors credit terms and ensures that it is not overexposed to any particular customer, minimising the risk of bad debt.
The company has built a strong pipeline of business and is able to respond quickly to changes in demand.
Key Risks faced by the company aside from those identified under Financial Risk management include:
Apprenticeship Quality, Compliance & Financial Health: The company must ensure that the quality of its learning provision meets standards set down by the Education Regulator OFSTED, and that its funding claims are compliant with ESFA requirements. The business manages this by ensuring that the quality of all aspects of training delivery and support are subject to regular review, monitoring and internal quality audit. Matters affecting quality and learner progression are discussed at regular senior management and board meetings. Financial Health of the business is regularly monitored to ensure that the company will be able to maintain its position on the register of approved training providers.
Product Obsolescence Risk: The business must ensure that it continues to offer sufficient variety of product to meet the needs of its customers, without being over
reliant on any one particular vendor or product stream. The business mitigates this risk by maintaining close relationships with all of its key vendors and partners, and continually researches alternative product sets to broaden its portfolio.
Business Continuity Risk: The company has moved key IT systems to the cloud to ensure that any potential disruption to company premises would not impact severely on the company’s ability to trade.
Coronavirus restrictions Risk: The business has developed online solutions to enable it to continue to trade in the event of the return of restrictions being placed on physical training.

Future developments
The y

Employees
Our success is dependent on employing people of the highest calibre and creating a work environment in which they can excel.
We achieve this by:
Fostering an environment which enables employees to develop their skills and knowledge.
Ensuring our people have regular opportunities to learn about all aspects of our business.
Encouraging open and honest assessment of employee performance and behaviour through regular performance feedback and annual appraisals.
Rewarding staff with fair and competitive salary and benefits packages and the opportunity to share in the success of the business.
In addition, the importance of operating with integrity, openness and respect is recognised by:
Encouraging a working environment in which employees feel comfortable about providing feedback and actively contributing to the development of the business.
Promoting an environment of equality of opportunity which is intolerant of discrimination, harassment or victimisation.
Maintaining healthy and safe working conditions.
The company places a high priority on providing an excellent level of both technical and soft skills training to its staff at all levels, and seeks to develop, where possible, staff through challenging work experiences including secondments through our overseas network of offices.
The employees of the Company are kept well informed of the performance and objectives of the company through staff briefings, monthly company conference calls, quarterly Group updates, and annual company meetings, and other communication channels including email and team meetings.
Employees are given the opportunity to develop and progress according to ability, irrespective of their race, creed, sex, marital status and age.
FIREBRAND TRAINING LIMITED
STRATEGIC REPORT (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2024
- 3 -
The company actively encourages the involvement of its staff, and regular meetings between company and team management and employees to allow a free flow of information and ideas. The company also conducts twice yearly employee feedback surveys, as well as encouraging feedback in regular daily, weekly and monthly team meetings, which is shared by senior management on a weekly basis.
The company gives full consideration to applications for employment from disabled persons where the requirements of the job can be adequately fulfilled by a handicapped or disabled person and to provide training and career development and promotion to disabled employees wherever appropriate.
Environment
The company acknowledges it has a duty to minimise its environmental impact, most of which is generated through the occupation of buildings, business travel of its employees and the generation of training documentation. The company has always taken its environmental responsibilities seriously and we have already put in place many environmental initiatives. We are committed to monitoring our environmental impact and looking for ways to reduce it focusing on those areas where the greatest impact can be be made. We will also endeavour to work with and influence our suppliers and business partners now and into the future
.
Our aims:
Minimise and conserve: We shall identify opportunities to reduce the resources we consume including energy, water, paper and other natural resources, thereby also minimising the amount of waste we produce. Where practicable, we shall reuse re-cycled materials and procure recycled products.
Comply: We shall endeavour to comply with all relevant environmental legislation and regulations. Moreover we shall treat these as the minimum standard and seek to exceed them wherever possible.
Measure and monitor: We shall implement and document a framework for setting and reviewing environmental objectives and for measuring performance.
Involve and communicate: We shall document and communicate our policy to employees, suppliers and business partners and provide the necessary training and resources to support the implementation of our policy where appropriate.
The trading results for the year and the company's financial position at the end of the year are shown in the attached financial statements.

R P Chapman
S Capaldo
G D MacLeod

Auditor
S&W Partners Audit Limited

Statement of directors' responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of the profit or loss of the company for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Strategic report
The company has chosen in accordance with Companies Act 2006, s. 414C(11) to set out in the company's strategic report information required by Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008, Sch. 7 to be contained in the directors' report. It has done so in respect of
financial risk management and future developments.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF FIREBRAND TRAINING LIMITED
- 6 -
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Firebrand Training Limited
(the 'company')
for the year ended 31 August 2024 which comprise the Statement of Income and Retained Earnings, the Balance Sheet and
notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies
. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 102
The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
In our opinion the financial statements:
give a true and fair view of the state of the company's affairs as at 31 August 2024 and of its profit for the year then ended;
have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the
Auditor's
responsibilities for the audit of the
financial statements
section of our report. We are independent of the
company
in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the
financial statements
in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard
, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Conclusions relating to going concern
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.
Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.
Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report.
Other information
The other information comprises the information included in the annual report other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.

Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of our audit
:
the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors' Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements
; and
the Strategic Report and the Directors' Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identifie
d
material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors'
r
eport
.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
certain disclosures of
remuneration specified by law are not made; or
we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the directors'
r
esponsibilities
s
tatement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of
financial statements
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the
financial statements
, the
directors are
responsible for assessing the company
'
s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either are to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or have
no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements
as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an
auditor's
report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with
ISAs (UK)
will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these
financial statements
.
Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures
in
line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities,
including
fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, is
detailed below.
the engagement partner ensured that the engagement team collectively had the appropriate competence,
capabilities and skills to identify or recognise non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations;
we identified the laws and regulations applicable to the company through discussions with directors and
other management, and from our commercial knowledge and experience of the sector;
we focused on specific laws and regulations which we considered may have a direct material effect on the
financial statements or the operations of the company, including the Companies Act 2006, taxation
legislation and data protection, anti-bribery, employment, environmental and health and safety
legislation;
we assessed the extent of compliance with the laws and regulations identified above through making
enquiries of management and reviewing legal and professional fee invoices;
we reviewed the minutes of board meetings to identify any references to non-compliance with laws and
regulations.
FIREBRAND TRAINING LIMITED
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF FIREBRAND TRAINING LIMITED (CONTINUED)
- 8 -
We assessed the susceptibility of the company’s financial statements to material misstatement, including obtaining an understanding of how fraud might occur, by:
making enquiries of management as to where they considered there was susceptibility to fraud, their knowledge of actual, suspected and alleged fraud;
considering the internal controls in place to mitigate risks of fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations.
To address the risk of fraud through management bias and override of controls, we:
performed analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships;
tested journal entries to identify unusual transactions;
assessed whether judgements and assumptions made in determining the accounting estimates set out in note 2 were indicative of potential bias; and
investigated the rationale behind significant or unusual transactions.
In response to the risk of irregularities and non-compliance with laws and regulations, we designed procedures which included, but were not limited to:
agreeing financial statement disclosures to underlying supporting documentation;
reading the minutes of meetings of those charged with governance;
enquiring of management as to actual and potential litigation and claims; and
reviewing correspondence with HMRC and relevant regulators.
reviewing the findings of the funding assurance audit to ensure compliance with apprenticeship funding regulations.
There are inherent limitations in our audit procedures described above. The more removed that laws and regulations are from financial transactions, the less likely it is that we would become aware of non-compliance. Auditing standards also limit the audit procedures required to identify non-compliance with laws and regulations to enquiry of the directors and other management and the inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence, if any.
Material misstatements that arise due to fraud can be harder to detect than those that arise from error as they may involve deliberate concealment or collusion.
A further description of our responsibilities is available on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at: https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor's report.
Use of our report
This report is made solely to the company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company's members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Accounting policies
Company information
Firebrand Training Limited is a
private
company
limited by shares
incorporated in
England and Wales
.
The registered office is
27 Old Gloucester Street, London, WC1N 3AX.
1.1
Accounting convention
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 102 “The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland” (“FRS 102”) and the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
The financial statements are prepared in
sterling
, which is the functional currency of the company.
Monetary a
mounts
in these financial statements are
rounded to the nearest £.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
This company is a qualifying entity for the purposes of FRS 102, being a member of a group where the parent of that group prepares
publicly available consolidated financial statements
, including this company,
which are
intended to give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities,
financial position and profit or loss
of the group
.
T
he company has
therefore
taken advantage of
e
xemptions from the following disclosure requirements:
Section 7 ‘Statement of Cash Flows’: Presentation of a statement of cash flow and related notes and disclosures;
Section 11 ‘Basic Financial Instruments’ and Section 12 ‘Other Financial Instrument Issues
': Interest income/expense and net gains/losses for each category of financial instrument;
Section 33 ‘Related Party Disclosures’
:

,
t
he directors have a reasonable expectation that the
company
has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus
t
he directors continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.
1.3
Reporting period
The current reporting period is a year.

Turnover
Turnover
is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and the rendering of services in the normal course of business, and is shown net of discounts and VAT.
Rendering of services
Revenue arises from the provision of stand-alone residential training courses and training under government-backed apprenticeships and bootcamps, and the associated course materials and assessment fees.
Revenue for stand-alone courses is recognised when the delegate completes the course.
Revenue for apprenticeships and bootcamps is recognised proportionally over the performance of the service contract, by reference to the stage of completion of the transaction at the end of the reporting period.
Other operating income
Other operating income consists of management charges receivable from entities trading under the Firebrand brand overseas, and is recognised proportionally as the services are provided over the agreed period.
1.5
Intangible fixed assets other than goodwill
Intangible assets
, representing qualifying computer software,
are recognised at cost less accumulated amortisation and
any
impairment losses.
Amortisation is recognised so as to write off the cost of assets less their residual values over their useful lives on the following bases:
Software
33.3% straight line basis

Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets
are measured at cost or valuation, net of depreciation and any impairment losses.
Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over their useful lives on the following bases:
Leasehold improvements
Over the period of the lease
Computer equipment
33.3% straight line basis
Fixtures, fittings & equipment
15% or 25% reducing balance basis
The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying value of the asset, and
is credited or charged to profit or loss
.
1.7
Impairment of fixed assets
At each reporting
period
end date, the
company
reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible
and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any).
1.8
Stocks
Stocks
represent course books and exam vouchers held for use on future courses, and
are stated at the lower of cost and
estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell
, after making allowances for obsolete items.

1.9
Financial instruments
The company has elected to apply the provisions of Section 11 ”Basic Financial Instruments” to all of its financial instruments.
Financial instruments are recognised in the company’s balance sheet when the company becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Basic financial assets
Short term debtors are measured at transaction price less any provision for impairment. Loans receivable, including those made to fellow group companies, are measured initially at fair value, net of transaction costs and are subsequently carried at amortised costs using the effective interest method, less any provision for impairment.
Other financial assets
Other financial assets, including investments in equity instruments which are not subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures, are initially measured at fair value, which is normally the transaction price. Such assets are subsequently carried at fair value and the changes in fair value are recognised in
profit
or
loss
, except that investments in equity instruments that are not publicly traded and whose fair values cannot be measured reliably are measured at cost less impairment.
Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets, other than those
held
at
fair value through profit and loss
, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each reporting end date.
Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows have been affected.
If an asset is impaired, the impairment loss is the difference between the carrying amount and the present value of the estimated cash flows discounted at the asset’s original effective interest rate. The impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss.
If there is a decrease in the impairment loss arising from an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the impairment is reversed. The reversal is such that the current carrying amount does not exceed what the carrying amount would have been, had the impairment not previously been recognised. The impairment reversal is recognised in profit or loss.
Derecognition of financial assets
Financial assets are derecognised only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or are settled, or when
the company
transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to another entity, or if some significant risks and rewards of ownership are retained but control of the asset has transferred to another party that is able to sell the asset in its entirety to an unrelated third party.
Basic financial liabilities
Short term creditors are measured at transaction price.
Other financial liabilities, including bank loans and other loans, are measured initially at fair value, net of transaction costs and are subsequently carried at amortised costs using the effective interest method.

Other financial liabilities
Derivatives, including interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts,
are not basic financial instruments.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are
s
ubsequently re-measured at their fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognised in
profit
or
loss
in finance costs or finance income as appropriate, unless hedge accounting is applied and the hedge is a cash flow hedge.
Debt instruments that do not meet the conditions in FRS 102 paragraph 11.9 are subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss. Debt instruments may be designated as
being measured at
fair value th
r
ough profit or loss to eliminate or reduce an accounting mismatch or if the instruments are measured and their performance evaluated on a fair value basis in accordance with a documented risk management or investment strategy.
Derecognition of financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the company’s contractual obligations
expire or are discharged or cancelled.
1.10
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable
and deferred tax.
Current tax
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the
profit and loss account
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The
company’s
liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting end date.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all timing differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting end date and reduced to the
extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the
asset to be recovered. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period
when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
1.11
Employee benefits
The costs of short-term employee benefits are recognised as a liability and an expense
.
The cost of any unused holiday entitlement is recognised in the period in which the employee’s services are received.
1.12
Retirement benefits
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
1.13
Leases
Rentals payable under operating leases,
including
any lease incentives received, are charged to
profit or loss
on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease except where another more systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the lease
s
asset are consumed.

Foreign exchange
Transactions in currencies other than
pounds sterling
are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At each reporting end date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the reporting end date. Gains and losses arising on translation
in the period
are included in profit or loss.
2
Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the company’s accounting policies, the directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised where the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods where the revision affects both current and future periods.
Critical judgements
The following judgements (apart from those involving estimates) have had the most significant
effect on amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Recognition of revenue on apprenticeships
Recognition of revenue in relation to government-backed apprenticeships requires judgement regarding the most appropriate pattern of revenue recognition, in the context of a changing funding environment. Following the introduction of the Levy, apprenticeship income has been invoiced more evenly over the period of the apprenticeship, with a significant amount being receivable on the successful completion of the apprenticeship. The directors have adjudged it appropriate to recognise Revenue across the duration of the Apprenticeship as and when fundable activities are performed, which includes initial and ongoing administration and support activities, delivery of training courses, and the End Point Assessments which mark the completion of the Apprenticeship
.
Recognition of revenue on bootcamps
Similar to Government-backed Apprenticeships, recognition of revenue in relation to the Skills Bootcamps programmes also requires judgment regarding the most appropriate pattern of revenue recognition. Bootcamp revenue is invoiced in three instalments subject to learners achieving certain milestones, including evidence of completion of learning and job outcomes. These milestones may occur after the company has performed the fundable activities and the directors have therefore judged it appropriate to recognise the first 90% of revenue in line with the delivery of the programmes, subject to the learners having completed the programme satisfactorily. Due to the relatively short nature of the programmes, this does not lead to a significant risk of material misstatement. The final 10% instalment, which is only receivable when job outcome is confirmed, is recognised when invoiced.
