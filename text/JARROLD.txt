Strategic report
52 week period from 30 January 2023 to 28 January 2024

Introduction

The directors present their strategic report for the 52 week period ended 28 January 2024. The comparative
period was the 52 week period ended 29 January 2023. The statement required in respect of section 172 of
the Companies Act 2006 is included in the directors’ report.

Principal activities

The principal activity of the parent undertaking and the Group are retailing, business services and property
letting, developing and management. Following the acquisition of RDM Distribution Limited in December 2023
distribution services also now form part of the Group's primary activities.

On the final day of the period, a group reorganisation was enacted. From this date, the principal activity of
the parent company was retailing, with the other group functions all being held in separate subsidiary
undertakings.

The primary objective of the reorganisation is to better align trading activities and associated assets to
statutory entities. Although having no effect on the consolidated position of the Group it has necessitated
transfers of assets and liabilities on an intra-group basis, including on occasion to newly incorporated entities.

The principal activities of the individual subsidiary undertakings are detailed in note 16 to the financial
statements.

Business review

The Group's financial statements are prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102 (FRS
102). This accounting standard includes a number of non-cash adjustments to profits and shareholders’ funds
which the directors’ consider may distort the underlying trading performance.

The 52 week period ended 28 January 2024 in many ways continued the emerging trends of the previous
financial period. While the ability to trade unencumbered has returned for a sustained period following the
Covid-19 pandemic, its impact in terms of shifting consumer demands, coupled with the ongoing cost of living
crisis has remained a clear theme.

A consistent level of turnover is considered a solid performance by the directors in this context, however the
ongoing inflationary pressure on margins, employment costs and overheads has resulted in a reported
operating profit (prior to interest and valuation related adjustments) that is lower than the prior period, falling
from £2,434k to £1,882k.

The impact on profitability is further exacerbated by the current economic climate in the form of rising interest
rates, with loan interest increasing from £803k to £1,106k. Furthermore, the commercial property market has
remained depressed, resulting in a revaluation loss of £6,566k.

While the financial period has been testing, leading to a reduction in shareholder funds from £57.4m to
£52.2m, a number of strategic actions have been taken which in the short term have reduced profitability, but
are focused on building long term growth in line with the Group's ambition. Most notably this includes the
costs involved in the reorganisation of the Group, and the project to expand the Group's operations in the
logistics space. The acquisition of RDM Distribution Limited provides a longer-term and secure route to growth
in this particular area.

Despite the challenges, there are significant positives to be drawn from performances across the Group's
trading portfolio.

Jarrold & Sons Limited
Strategic report (continued)

52 week period from 30 January 2023 to 28 January 2024

The Group operates in a number of areas, the most significant of which are considered to be:

* Property: The property business continued to trade successfully during the period with no rent
defaults and high occupancy levels. While flexibility has been required in securing renewals and
new leases, it is pleasing that the property portfolio continues to provide a stable foundation for the
Group's operations.

* Retail: the Group continues to strive for innovation as part of the strategy to evolve the offering to
centre on lifestyle and experience, as opposed to a commoditised product offering. The continued
success of the Food Hall and Wine Bars is a huge positive, and has contributed to footfall and top
line growth which has outstripped our peers. Inflationary pressures and a need to focus resources
on fuelling sales growth has however hit profitability, with a significant proportion of the reduction in
operating profit coming from this division and the investment in logistics noted previously. We have
however continued to invest where appropriate, including in the growth of the crucial Loyalty
membership, and in reviewing the e-commerce strategy.

* Training: organic growth in the Training business remained strong as its burgeoning reputation for
delivering excellent training continued. investment in further sales resource and in entering new
geographical markets did not however lead to additional growth, with the associated costs impacting
on profitability compared to the previous period.

* Business Service: this division increased it's profitability by 34%, following strong top line growth
and a continued focus on maintaining tight cost control. Further expansion in the local area and
further afield is anticipated going forwards.

In addition to the trading divisions a significant focus has been on the organisational structure and cost base
which underpins the trading performance. A review and rationalisation of these areas as part of succession
planning has resulted in an 18% reduction in costs.

A key element of this was the reorganisation of the Group enacted prior to the period end on 28 January
2024. The realignment of trading activities to individual subsidiary companies provides a strong foundation to
explore opportunities for growth and diversification.

Cash balances remain a key area of focus, remaining steady at £7m, despite the impact of rising interest
rates and the acquisition of RDM Distribution Limited during the period, as well as the payment of £300k
dividends.

Future developments

The directors anticipate that the Group will continue its existing activities in a consistent and measured
manner, while looking to leverage the retail brand and diversify business activities. In line with this strategy,
the Group acquired Yawn Marketing Limited in March 2024. As well as strengthening the capability of the
Group's existing marketing function, the acquisition provides a further service offering as we continue to build
our presence in the B2B market.

The Group continues to proactively assess its property portfolio as opportunities to do so arise.
Key performance indicators

The Group uses a range of performance measures to monitor and manage the business effectively. While
these are both financial and non-financial, the most significant of these are financial key performance
indicators (KPI's).

The key performance indicators are therefore considered to be turnover, gross profit and margin. The key
non-financial performance indicator is the number of staff employed by the Group.

Jarrold & Sons Limited
Strategic report (continued)

52 week period from 30 January 2023 to 28 January 2024

The key financial performance indicators for the 52 week period ended 28 January 2024, with comparatives
for the 52 week period ended 29 January 2023, are set out below:

Financial key performance indicators

52 weeks to 52 weeks to
28 January 29 January

2024 2023
Turnover (£'000) 31,867 32,091
Gross profit (£'000) . 6,075 6,223
Gross profit margin (%) 19.1 19.4
Average number of employees 398 419

Principal risks and uncertainties

As noted above, the principal activities of the group are retail, distribution, business services and property
businesses. The principal risk that the Group faces relate to the ongoing cost of living crisis. Notwithstanding
this the directors remain mindful of wider underlying risks and in common with many businesses carrying out
similar activities, the principal risks and uncertainties it faces are consumer spending downturn, loca! retail
competition, changes in demand for office accommodation and a change in general economic conditions.
While recognising the existence of such risks, the directors believe the Group is well placed to successfully
deal with any such challenges should they arise. This judgement reflects their assessment of the breadth of
the Group's retail provision, the quality of its property assets, and the continued diversification of business
activities.

Financial risk management objectives and policies

The Group uses various financial instruments including deposit accounts and cash, and items such as trade
debtors and trade creditors that arise directly from its operations. The main purpose of these financial
instruments is to ensure sufficient finance for the Group's operations. The existence of these financial
instruments exposes the Group to a number of financial risks, which are described in more detail below. The
main risks arising from the Group's financial instruments are credit risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
The directors review and agree policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
The policies have remained unchanged from previous periods.

Credit risk

The Group's principal credit risk is the recovery of amounts owed by trade debtors. In order to manage credit
risk the directors set limits for customers based on a combination of payment history and third party credit
reference information. Credit limits are reviewed on a regular basis in accordance with debt ageing and
collection history. Debts are actively chased by the credit control department.

Interest rate risk

The Group has £15.4m bank loan in existence at 28 January 2024 (2023: £16.3m) as detailed in note 21.
The Group also had a derivative contract (loan interest swap) in existence at 28 January 2024 as detailed in
note 25.

Liquidity risk
As a result of positive cashflows from operating activities and the current asset position, the directors do not

consider liquidity or cashflow risk to be an issue although these areas are closely monitored to ensure the
Group's procedures continue to operate effectively to minimise risks.

52 week period from 30 January 2023 to 28 January 2024

Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions

In line with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG) Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, the Group
has been engaged in a process aimed at reducing our energy and greenhouse gas emissions. The Group
and its directors are fully committed to preventing pollution, and making continual improvements to minimise
its effect on the environment.

Unavoidably, Jarrold & Sons Limited recognise that its business activities interact with the environment in a
variety of ways including via the use of energy, generation of waste and indirectly through the activities of its
tenants. The Group recognises its responsibility to help protect the environment, be a responsible neighbour
and provide a comfortable environment for its employees. The Group is committed to:

* Continual improvement in the environmental impact of its business activities.
* Complying with all relevant legal, customer, and other third-party requirements.
« Adopting best practices applicable to its activities wherever possible.

The Group will achieve these commitments by:

* The continued compliance with our management system under ISO14001:2015.
* Protecting the environment and preventing pollution.
¢ Maintaining an environmental performance improvement programme.

To reduce the Group's carbon footprint 100% of its electricity procurement is certified to be from renewable
sources. Its 100% renewable electricity tariffs are certified by the Carbon Trust to be compliant with the
Greenhouse Gas Protocol Scope 2 Guidance which means that the Group can report zero carbon emissions
for purchased electricity. Actions taken to reduce electricity consumption in the past year have included the
extensive replacement of almost all legacy lighting systems with low energy LED lighting and improved control
over HVAC systems to reduce consumption. There is also particular focus on the reduction in use of gas
which now accounts for most of its emissions. Investment has been made in new energy efficient gas boilers
and we are reviewing alternative methods of heating such as air source heat pumps and improved thermal
insulation to reduce gas consumption. Given the nature and age of some buildings occupied by the Group
there is an element of energy usage that will be difficult to to reduce quickly.

The emissions of the Group in the 52-week period ended 28 January 2024 are summarised below. In
presenting this information we note that we have reported all of emission sources under the Companies Act
2006 (Strategic Report and Director's Reports) Regulations 2013 as required. We have calculated and
reported our emissions in line with the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (revised
edition) and emission factors from the UK Government's GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting
2022 and 2023. The information is given as it relates to Jarrold & Sons Limited as an entity, having regard to
the fact that no other entities in the Group meet the criteria for reporting.

Our calculated carbon footprint for our current financial year is 124 tCO2e, whilst energy consumption was
2,944,000 kWh (2.9 MWh).

The boundaries of the GHG inventory are defined using the operational control approach. In general, the
emissions reported are the same as those which would be reported based on a financial control boundary.
Emissions for previous years are retrospectively adjusted as and when more accurate data is provided

Dividends
Payment of a dividend in the amount of £0.04 per ordinary share was made in June 2023, totalling £200,000.

A further interim dividend of £0.02 per ordinary share was paid in January 2024, totaling £100,000.
Subsequent to 28 January 2024 the payment of a final dividend of £0.02 per ordinary share was approved.
The total amount of £100,000 is expected to be paid in June 2024.

No dividends were paid or proposed on ordinary shares in the 52 week period ended 29 January 2023.
See note 11 for details of preference share dividends.
Director's and officer's liability insurance

During the period the company maintained liability insurance for its directors and officers, as permitted by
section 223 of the Companies Act 2006.

Fixed assets

Expenditure on tangible fixed assets during the period is shown in note 15 to the financial statements. In the
opinion of the directors the realisable value of the freehold land and buildings used in the Group's trade is
substantially in excess of the book amount, but they do not consider the cost of an independent valuation is
justifiable at the present time.

Donations

Charitable donations amounted to £3,000 (2023: £6,773). This amount would be higher but for the many
appeals supported through the John Jarrold Trust Limited, a charitable foundation connected with the Group
through its shareholding. Actual contributions are administered by the board of directors and are directed
towards assisting charitable organisations in areas where the Group has its principal operations. During the
period the John Jarrold Trust Limited made charitable donations amounting to £50,975 (2023: £52,700). In
addition, Retail Staff Charity. Challenge raised £16,702 (2023: £19,313) for good causes.

The company also provides office accommodation for local charity Norfolk Community Foundation on a
service charge contribution basis only. The estimated market rent forgone is £45,000 (2023: £45,000). No
contributions were made to political organisations.

Employment of disabled persons

The Group gives every consideration to employment of disabled persons who are able to meet the
requirements of the job. Training, career development and promotion will be available to such persons where
this is in their own and the Group's, best interest.

Where employees become disabled the Group endeavours to continue to employ them, provided there are
duties which they can perform, bearing in mind the nature of their disability.

the ongoing running of the business.

Section 172 statement

This section serves as our section 172 statement and should be read in conjunction with the Strategic report
on pages 2 to 6. Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 requires Directors to take into consideration the
interests of stakeholders in their decision making. The Directors continue to have regard to the interests of
the Group's and company's employees and other stakeholders, including the impact of its activities on the
community, the environment and the Group's reputation, when making decisions. Acting in good faith and
fairly between members, the Directors consider what is most likely to promote the success of the group and
company for its members in the long term. Whilst the importance of giving due consideration to our
stakeholders is not new, we are explaining in more detail this year how the Board engages with our
stakeholders, thus complying with the requirement to include a statement setting out how our Directors have
discharged this duty.

In this context we note the following:

* The Directors are fully aware of their responsibilities to promote the success of the Group and
company in accordance with section 172 of the Companies Act 2006. To ensure the Group and
company the Board regularly reflects on how the Group engages with its stakeholders and
opportunities for enhancement in the future. Such reflections are facilitated by the Board's
composition; being made up of a mix of executive and non-executive members who combine a
shareholder's perspective with that of management and independent members (who themselves
have a wide range of experience). :

* The Board regularly reviews our principal stakeholders and how we engage with them. The
stakeholder voice is brought into the boardroom through information provided by management and
also by direct engagement with stakeholders themselves. Such stakeholders include shareholders,
employees, customers, tenants and the wider community in which the Group operates. The relevance
of each stakeholder group may increase or decrease depending on the matter or issue in question,
so the Board seeks to consider the needs and priorities of each stakeholder group during its
discussions and as part of its decision making.

Jarrold & Sons Limited
Directors' report (continued)

52 week period from 30 January 2023 to 28 January 2024

* The Board continues to enhance its methods of engagement with the workforce.

* We aim to work responsibly with our suppliers. The importance of supplier relationships is also
recognised, as evidenced by paying suppliers to agreed terms.

* The Group contributes to the communities of Norwich and Norfolk in many different ways. Requests
for charitable donations on behalf of the company are usually referred to the John Jarrold Trust and
over many years Directors and other staff have also been involved in local institutions and charities
as Trustees, Governors or Board Directors. The Group recognises that it is important for the healthy
development of the community in which it operates to participate in this way.

The fundamental overriding principles in the governance of the Group and company is that of ensuring
transparent conduct which reflects fairness in all dealings with the shareholder, employees, customers and
suppliers. The Group has been part of the business community in Norwich and Norfolk since 1823 and is
rooted in the community with an exciting vision for the future.

Directors’ responsibilities statement

The directors are responsible for preparing the strategic report, directors’ report and the financial statements
in accordance with applicable law and regulations.

Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial period. Under that law
the directors have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company
law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and
fair view of the state of affairs of the group and the company and the profit or loss of the group for that period.

In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:
* select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
* make judgments and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;

+ state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material
departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements;

* prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the
company will continue in business.

The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain
the company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the
company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They
are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and hence for taking reasonable steps for
the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

Disclosure of information to auditor

. so far as they are aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Group and the company's
auditor is unaware; and ‘

. they have taken all steps that they ought to have taken as a director to make themselves aware of any

relevant audit information and to establish that the Group and the company's auditor is aware of that

Jarrold & Sons Limited
Independent auditor's report to the members of Jarrold & Sons Limited

52 week period from 30 January 2023 to 28 January 2024

Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of Jarrold & Sons Limited (the ‘parent company’) and its subsidiaries
(the ‘Group') for the 52 week period ended 28 January 2024 which comprise the consolidated statement of
comprehensive income, consolidated statement of financial position, company statement of financial position,
consolidated statement of changes in equity, company statement of changes in equity, consolidated
statement of cash flows and the related notes, including a summary of significant accounting policies. The
financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom
Accounting Standards, including FRS 102 The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and
Republic of treland (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

In our opinion the financial statements:

. give a true and fair view of the state of the Group's and of the parent company's affairs as at 28 January
2024 and of the Group's loss for the 52 week period then ended;

° have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice;

. have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and
applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor responsibilities
for the audit of the Annual report and financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the
group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the Annual report and
financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Conclusions relating to going concern

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of
accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or
conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as
a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for
issue.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the
relevant sections of this report.

52 week period from 30 January 2023 to 28 January 2024

Other information

The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial
statements and our auditor's report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. Our
opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise
explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and,
in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or
our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such
material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is
a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If,
based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other
information, we are required to report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

° the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial period for which the
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and

. the strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal
requirements.

Matters on which we are required to report by exception

In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the parent company and its environment
obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or
the directors’ report.

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006
requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:

. adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our
audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or

° the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns;
or

° certain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or

. we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

Responsibilities of directors

As explained more fully in the directors' responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such
internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group's and the parent
company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern

and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or
the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Jarrold & Sons Limited
Independent auditor's report to the members of Jarrold & Sons Limited (continueg)

52 week period from 30 January 2023 to 28 January 2024

Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the annual report and financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Annual report and financial statements
as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report
that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an
audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate,
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these
Annual report and financial statements.

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design

procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of

irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities,

including fraud is detailed below:

Our approach to identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities,

including fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations, was as follows:

° we identified the principal laws and regulations applicable to the company and group through
discussions with management and our wider knowledge and experience; and

° identified laws and regulations were considered in our planning of the audit.

We assessed the susceptibility of the company's financial statements to material misstatement, including

obtaining an understanding of how fraud might occur, by:

. making enquiries of management and directors as to where they considered there was susceptibility
to fraud, their knowledge of actual, suspected and alleged fraud;

. considering the results of prior year financial statement audits; and

. reflecting on our wider experience and client base.

To address the risk of fraud through management bias and override of controls, we:

. performed analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships;
. reviewed (on a sample basis) journal entries to identify material unusual transactions; and

. assessed whether judgements and assumptions made in determining key accounting estimates were
indicative of potential bias.

In response to the risk of irregularities and non-compliance with laws and regulations, we designed
procedures which included, but were not limited to:

. sample based testing of revenue;

. agreeing material financial statement disclosures to underlying supporting documentation; and

. obtaining representations from management and directors as to actual and potential litigation and
claims.

Because of the inherent limitations of an audit, there is a risk that we will not detect all irregularities, including
those leading to a material misstatement in the financial statements or non-compliance with

regulation. This risk increases the more that compliance with a law or regulation is removed from the events
and transactions reflected in the financial statements, as we will be less likely to become aware of instances
of non-compliance. The risk is also greater regarding irregularities occurring due to fraud rather than error,
as fraud involves intentional concealment, forgery, collusion, omission or misrepresentation.

A further description of our responsibilities is available on the FRC’s website at
www. frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor's report.

Use of our report

This report is made solely to the company's members, as a body, in accordance with chapter 3 of part 16 of
the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company's
members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To
the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the
company and the company's members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we
have formed.

Jarrold & Sons Limited

Notes to the annual report and financial statements

52 week period from 30 January 2023 to 28 January 2024

1.

General information

Jarrold & Sons Limited (‘the company’) and its subsidiaries (together ‘the group") operate a retailing,
business services and property letting, development, management business and distribution. The
company is a private company limited by shares and is incorporated in the United Kingdom under the
Companies Act 2006. The address of its registered office is St James Mill, Whitefriars, Norwich, Norfolk,
NR3 1SH.

Statement of compliance

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom
accounting standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 102 — 'The Financial Reporting Standard
applicable in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland’ (‘FRS 102'), and with the Companies Act
2006.

Accounting policies
Basis of preparation

The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except that certain freehold
land and buildings held as investments are shown at their fair vatues. In addition certain derivative
financial instruments are shown at their fair values also as specified in the accounting policies below.

The accounting period of the Group and company ends on the Sunday nearest to 31 January, which
results in financial periods of either 52 or 53 weeks. The financial statements are presented in Sterling

(£).
Going concern

The Group has generated sufficient liquid financial resources from its activities to allow the directors to
believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully in the current challenging
economic climate. The Group continues to meets its day-to-day working capital requirements through
its cash balances and bank facilities.

In reviewing the application of going concern the directors have also recognised that the COVID-19
pandemic and the more recent Ukrainian war and subsequent inflationary pressures, have significantly
changed the economic environment in which the Group presently operates. In this context the directors
have sought to take into account a number of specific factors when preparing the forecasts for the 12
months following the signing of the financial statements (considering the foreseeable future). Such
factors include (but are not limited to) the following:

« Uncertainty as to the timing and level of retail demand. This can affect wider consumer
confidence and levels of disposable income. These in turn can be inhibited by the effects of
price inflation, particularly as it relates to essential goods such as energy and food.

* Disruption to the supply chain of our retail activities. Whilst subsiding post-pandemic
this remains subject to variations of freight availability and an increase in direct
costs. Ongoing international conflict can lead to availability issues that manifest themselves
in further inflated prices which combined with reducing consumer demand as a result of the
same can have concentrated impact.

* —Longer-term shifts in demand for office accommodation. While to date the Group has been

successful in securing new appropriate tenants when required, this may prove more difficult
as working patterns evolve and demand for space fluctuates.

Jarrold & Sons Limited

Notes to the annual report and financial statements (continued)

52 week period from 30 January 2023 to 28 January 2024

3.

Accounting policies (continued)

Mitigating considerations that have also been taken into account include the Group's ownership of its
key operating assets (including the main retail store), substantial level of cash balances presently held,
ongoing availability of secured loan facilities, a significant unencumbered asset base and a proven
ability to manage costs and working capital in the event of a reduction in trading levels. Activities
continue to diversify the business away from the capital intensive elements of the traditional retail
operation further minimising the exposure to large swings in working capital and therefore cash
requirements.

Taken together, the directors consequently have a reasonable expectation that the company and Group
has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the
directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.

Disciosure exemptions

FRS 102 allows a qualifying entity certain disclosure exemptions, subject to certain conditions, which
have been complied with, including notification of, and no objection to, the use of exemptions by the
company’s shareholders.

The company has taken advantage of the following exemptions:

- from preparing a statement of cash flows, on the basis that it is a qualifying entity and the
consolidated statement of cash flows, included in these financial statements, includes the company’s
cash flows;

- from disclosing the company key management personnel compensation, as required by FRS 102
paragraph 33.7

- from disclosing related party transactions with entities that are wholly owned by Jarrold & Sons
Limited.

Basis of consolidation

The consolidated financial statements present the results of Group and its own subsidiaries as if they
formed a single entity. Intercompany transactions and balances between Group companies are
therefore eliminated in full.

The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of business combinations using the
purchase method. In the statement of financial position, the acquiree's identifiable assets, liabilities and
contingent liabilities are initially recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date. The results of
acquired operations are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the date
on which control is obtained. They are deconsolidated from the date control ceases.

The parent company has applied the exemption contained in section 408 of the Companies Act 2006
and has not presented its individual profit and loss account.

Accounting policies (continued)
True and fair override on the transfer of investments in subsidiary undertakings

On 28 January 2024 a Group reorganisation took place whereby assets were moved between entities.
Although having no effect on the consolidated financial statements, investments in three subsidiaries
held directly by Jarrold & Sons Limited were transferred to an intermediate holding company (Jarrold
(Property Holding Company) Limited). The issued share capital of Jarrold (Property Holding Company)
Limited (received by Jarrold & Sons Limited in exchange for the investments) was valued at £15.1m,
being £12.7m in excess of the carrying value of the investments being transferred. Following the
principles of merger accounting and to present a true and fair view (i.e. there is considered to have been
no change in the underlying cost of investments), the gain of £12.7m has not been recognised by Jarrold
& Sons Limited.

Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty

In the application of the Group's accounting policies, the Directors are required to make judgements and
estimates. Such judgements and estimates (together with associated assumptions) are based on
historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant and are reviewed on an
ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is
revised, if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the
revision affects both current and future periods.

The judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial
statements, the key assumptions concerning the future and other sources of estimation uncertainty at
the reporting date that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts
of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are outlined below:

Fair value of investment properties (note 15):

Investment properties are recorded at their fair value. Such values are determined by the directors by
applying published market indices to rental income being earned at the period end. While it is noted that
other methods might be applied that could result in materially different valuations, it is judged that the
chosen method is transparent and less susceptible to bias or inconsistent application over time (having
been applied in this way for many years).

The method adopted nonetheless requires the application of judgement with regard to the nature of
such properties, relative to those that underpin the general indices used by the directors as the basis
for their estimations of value. The majority of the Group's portfolio is considered to comprise of prime
office accommodation in a provincial location and it is a yield consistent with that judgement that has
been applied to the largest part of the asset base held for investment purposes.

Notes to the annual report and financial statements (continueg)

52 week period from 30 January 2023 to 28 January 2024

3.

Accounting policies (continued)

Aside from these pervasive judgements, recurring factors that may affect the fair value of a property
include quality of tenant covenant, length of lease terms and general demand for office accommodation.
Assumptions made concerning these and other matters (which may reasonably be expected to give rise
to a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year)
may be summarised as follows:

Occupancy and rental inflation: The valuations are calculated by reference to current rental income
and assume that present and imminent voids will be filled and at rental levels consistent with those
achieved historically. Present voids are minimal, and it is expected that these will be filled in the
next 6 to 12 months (being subject to ongoing negotiation). While there are material lease
arrangements that are in the process of being finalised, these are expected to be concluded
positively at rental levels consistent with those presently earned. In the event that present or future
voids are not filled, the effect on property valuations could be materially adverse. No material
increase in rental levels are anticipated in the property valuation process and to the extent that they
were achieved this may be expected to positively affect overall values.

Lotting: The overall valuation is an aggregation of value applied to individual assets. No adjustment
has been made to apply a premium or discount in the event that one or more properties were valued
together. Given that the majority of the Group's investment properties are locationally close to each
other, it might be considered acceptable to apply such an adjustment. It is not considered possible
to accurately reflect the different permutations that might arise in this regard.

Yields: As noted above the directors assess the quality of property held and apply appropriate
yields, informed by recognised data sources. Such published yields cover a broad range of property
type, and a purchaser might seek to apply a higher or lower yield depending on many different
factors (including but not timited to occupancy, rental inflation and the number of properties
acquired). The effect of a sensitivity applied to the yield rates could be materially adverse or positive.
In broad terms an increase of 1% in yields across the investment property portfolio would use reduce
values by approximately £6m. Inversely, a decrease of 1% in yields across the investment property
portfolio would increase values by approximately £8m.

Classification of tangible fixed assets (note 15):

The classification of fixed assets determines the basis upon which they are accounted for. Such
classification is a matter of judgement. In this regard the judgements that are considered to have the
most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements relate to:

Assets in the course of construction: Such amounts relate to land and infrastructure costs incurred
as part of a long-term development that are not allocated to complete and separable assets. The
nature of the development is such that it has been in progress for more than 15 years and is being
undertaken to maximise the financial return thereon in the context of complex planning and
commercial factors. Consequently, it is judged appropriate to consider the assets as being in the
course of construction and not therefore subject to depreciation. They are nonetheless subject to
an annual review for impairment (see below).

Investment properties: Such assets are held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation or both. The
group holds a number of assets that are (presently or formerly), predominantly functional assets for
use in the supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes. While elements of such assets
may be let on an incidental basis or may in the long-term yield a capital gain, they are not judged to
be investment properties and are therefore accounted for as fixed assets on an amortised cost
basis. It is not possible to reliably estimate the quantum of any gain that might reasonably be
expected to arise or the timing thereof.

Carrying value of tangible fixed assets (note 15):

Other than investment properties, tangible fixed assets are recorded at cost less accumulated
depreciation. The application of judgement and estimation is required in accounting for such assets.
Specific points in this regard relate to:

« Useful economic lives and residual values: The assessment of these is an estimate determined by
the application of judgement. While consideration is given to past experience and the present basis
of operation, it is likely that the actual experience will differ from that anticipated. Details are given
later in this note of the useful economic lives that underpin the calculation of depreciation. While it
is not uncommon for assets to be retained in the business after they are fully depreciated, this is is
not considered to indicate a material change in the rates applied is required.

+ Impairment review: Judgement is applied in determining whether there are impairment indicators
relating to tangible fixed assets (including assets in the course of construction against which
depreciation is not charged) and whether an impairment has arisen in the period. No such
impairments have arisen in this financial period.

Fair value of derivative financial instruments (note 25):

The Group has entered into swap arrangements to manage interest rate cost risk. Such swap
arrangements are recorded at their fair value which are based upon information provided by the financial
institutions with whom such instruments are held. The estimation of such values requires the
combination of several assumptions - many of which are linked directly to the terms of the instruments.
The value included in the financial statements is provided directly by the counterparty and no
adjustments are judged necessary or appropriate as at the period end.

Defined benefit pension scheme (note 24):

The group has obligations to pay pension benefits to certain employees via its defined benefit pension
scheme. In accounting for this matter it is necessary to apply judgement and to make estimates that are
material to the reported position and/or financial statement disclosures. In this context the following
should be noted:

* Judgement in accounting for a buy-in transaction: During the 52 week period ended 29 January
2023, the group entered into a ‘buy-in’ arrangement with a third-party insurer. The arrangement is
such that the payment of future scheme benefits will be funded by the insurer, although Jarrold &
Sons Limited remains legally obligated to ensure such liabilities are discharged. As the cost of
buying such a policy exceeded its subsequent carrying value (the discount rate used by the insurer
is lower than that used for financial reporting purposes) a loss arose on the transaction, which was
recognised in other comprehensive income. This treatment reflected a judgement that the loss
resulted from exchanging one plan asset for another. An alternative treatment would be to recognise
the loss as a settlement loss recognised as a charge to profit. The directors consider that taking into
account the ongoing legal obligation (which underpins the continued accounting for scheme assets
and liabilities) that the adopted approach is a consistent and appropriate one.

¢ Estimation uncertainty: The cost of benefits provided by the scheme and the consequential present
value of obligations depend on a number of factors, including; life expectancy, inflation, asset
valuations and the discount rate on corporate bonds. Management adopt the services of a third-
party qualified actuary to make such estimates and to determine the net pension asset/obligation
reported in the balance sheet. The assumptions reflect historical experience and current trends. No
changes are made by management to the assumptions applied by the retained actuary. Given the
buy-in transaction entered into during the 52 week period ended 29 January 2023 any variation in
assumptions applied in calculating liabilities would be matched by an equal and opposite movement
in the value attributed to insurance policies held. On this basis no sensitivities have been calculated
or disclosed in this regard.

Carrying value of stock (note 17):

The group retails clothing, food and other goods that are subject to changing customer demand,
deterioration and seasonal/fashion related factors. Consequently, in calculating the carrying value of
stock (being the lower of cost and its net realisable value) there is a degree of judgement as to which
stock items will be so affected and to what extent (the latter being an estimation). Given the nature and
volume of items held this matter is addressed by the application of well-established methodology, that
nonetheless gives rise to the risk of estimation uncertainty.

Revenue

Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the group
and the revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is measured as the fair value of the consideration
received or receivable, excluding discounts, rebates, value added tax and other sales taxes. The
following criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised:

Sale of goods

Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when all of the following conditions are satisfied:

- the group has transferred the significant risks and rewards of ownership to the buyer;

- the group retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated
with ownership nor effective control over the goods sold;

- the amount of revenue can be measured reliably;

- itis probable that the group will receive the consideration due under the transaction; and

- the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.
Rendering of services

Revenue from a contract to provide services is recognised in the period in which the services are
provided in accordance with the stage of completion of the contract when all of the following conditions
are satisfied:

- the amount of revenue can be measured reliably;

- it is probable that the group will receive the consideration due under the contract;

- the stage of completion of the contract at the end of the reporting period can be measured reliably;

- the costs incurred and the costs to complete the contract can be measured reliably.

Retail concessions

Turnover comprises the commission received from retail concessions operating in the department store
recognised in the period to which it relates.

Rental income

Rental income from investment properties is recognised in the period to which it relates.

Current and deferred taxation

The tax expense for the 52 week period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, except that a charge attributable to an item of
income and expense recognised as other comprehensive income or to an item recognised directly in
equity is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.

The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of tax rates and laws that have been enacted
or substantively enacted by the reporting date in the countries where the company and the Group
operate and generate income.

Deferred tax balances are recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not
reversed by the Statement of Financial Position date, except that:

- The recognition of deferred tax assets is limited to the extent that it is probable that they will be
recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits;

- Any deferred tax balances are reversed if and when all conditions for retaining associated tax
allowances have been met; and

- Where they relate to timing differences in respect of interests in subsidiaries, associates,
branches and joint ventures and the Group can control the reversal of the timing differences and such
reversal is not considered probable in the foreseeable future.
Operating leases

Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive
Income on a straight line basis over the lease term.

Goodwill

Goodwill arises on business acquisitions and represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition over
the company's interest in the net amount of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of
the acquired business.

Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. It is
amortised on a straight-line basis over its useful life.

Tangible assets

Tangible fixed assets under the cost model, other than investment properties, are stated at historical
cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Historical cost includes
expenditure that is directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for
it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.

Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is charged so as to allocate the cost of assets
less their residual value over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method. The estimated
useful lives range as follows.

The assets' residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted
prospectively if appropriate, or if there is an indication of a significant change since the last reporting
date.

Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount
and are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.

Depreciation

Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost or valuation of an asset, less its residual value, over
the useful economic life of that asset as follows:

Freehold property -  2-4% straight line
Plant and machinery - 10-33% per annum
Motor vehicles - 20% straight line

Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated until they are bought into use.
Investment property

Investment property is carried at fair value determined annually by the directors and derived from the
current market rents and investment property yields for comparable real estate, adjusted if necessary
for any difference in the nature, location or condition of the specific asset. No depreciation is provided.
Changes in fair value are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.

Changes in fair value are transferred into the separable non-distributable revaluation reserve within the
Statement of Changes in Equity.

Valuation of investments
Investments in subsidiaries are measured at cost less accumulated impairment.
Impairment of assets

At each reporting date fixed assets (both tangible and intangible) are reviewed to determine whether
there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If there is an indication of
possible impairment, the recoverable amount of any affected asset is estimated and compared with its
carrying amount. If estimated recoverable amount is lower, the carrying amount is reduced to its
estimated recoverable amount, and an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.

\f an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carry amount of the asset is increased to the revised
estimate of its recoverable amount, but not in excess of the amount that would have been determined
had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss
is recognised immediately in profit or loss.

Stocks

Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value, being in certain instances estimated
using the retail method of stock valuation, measuring cost by reducing the sales value of the inventory
by the appropriate percentage gross margin, as permitted by FRS 102 (para 13.16).

At each reporting date, stocks are assessed for impairment. If stock is impaired, the carrying amount is
reduced to its selling price. The impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.

Financial assets and liabilities

Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual
arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the
assets of the entity after deducting all of its financial liabilities.

Where the contractual obligations of financial instruments (including share capital) are equivalent to a
similar debt instrument, those financial instruments are classed as financial liabilities. Financial liabilities
are presented as such in the Statement of Financial Position. Finance costs and gains or losses relating
to financial liabilities are included in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.

Where the contractual terms of share capital do not have any terms meeting the definition of a financial
liability then this is classed as an equity instrument. Dividends and distributions relating to equity
instruments are debited direct to equity.

Derivative instruments

The Group uses an interest rate swap agreement to reduce exposure to interest rate movements.

The instruments are initially measured at fair value when the instrument is first entered into and are
subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss. Upon extinguishment a gain or loss is

fealised, being the difference between the settlement cost and the instrument's fair value at
extinguishment.

The derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when fair value is
negative.

Finance costs

Finance costs are charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income over the term of
the debt using the effective interest method so that the amount charged is at a constant rate on the
carrying amount. Issue costs are initially recognised as a reduction in the proceeds of the associated
capital instrument.

Dividends
Equity dividends are recognised when they become legally payable. Interim equity dividends are
recognised when paid. Final equity dividends are recognised when approved by the shareholders at an

annual general meeting.

Dividends on shares recognised as liabilities are recognised as expenses and classified within interest
payable.

Defined benefit plans

The Group operates a defined benefit plan for certain employees. A defined benefit plan defines the
pension benefit that the employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent upon several factors
including but not limited to age, length of service and remuneration. A defined benefit plan is a pension
plan that is not a defined contribution plan.

The asset or liability recognised in the Statement of financial position in respect of the defined benefit
plan is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting date less the fair
value of plan assets at the reporting date (if any) out of which the obligations are to be settled.

The defined benefit obligation is calculated using the projected unit credit method. Annually the
company engages independent actuaries to calculate the obligation. The present value is determined
by discounting the estimated future payments using market yields on high quality corporate bonds that
are denominated in sterling and that have terms approximating to the estimated period of the future
payments (‘discount rate’).

The fair value of plan assets is measured in accordance with the FRS 102 fair value hierarchy and in
accordance with the Group's policy for similarly held assets. This includes the use of appropriate
valuation techniques.

Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions
are charged or credited to other comprehensive income. These amounts together with the return on
plan assets, less amounts included in net interest, are disclosed as ‘Actuarial gains/(losses) on defined
benefit pension scheme’.

The cost of the defined benefit plan, recognised in profit or loss as employee costs, except where
included in the cost of an asset, comprises:

a) the increase in net pension benefit liability arising from employee service during the period; and
b) the cost of plan introductions, benefit changes, curtailments and settlements.

The net interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of the defined benefit
obligation and the fair value of plan assets. This cost is recognised in profit or loss as a ‘finance expense’.

Defined contribution plans

Contributions to personal pension and defined contribution plans are recognised as an expense in the
Income statement when they fall due. Amounts not paid are shown in accruals as a liability in the
Statement of financial position. The assets of such plans are held separately from the group in
independently administered funds.

Holiday pay accrual
A liability is recognised to the extent of any unused holiday pay entitlement which is accrued at the
Statement of financial position date and carried forward to future periods. This is measured at the

undiscounted salary cost of the future holiday entitlement so accrued at the Statement of financial
position date.

Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method.

The cost of a business combination is measured as the aggregate of the fair values, at the acquisition
date, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued plus any costs
directly attributable to the business combination.

Where control is achieved in stages, the cost of the business combination is the aggregate of the fair
values of the assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued at the date of
each transaction in the series.

Where the business combination requires an adjustment to the cost contingent on future events, the
estimated amount of that adjustment is included in the cost of the combination at the acquisition date
providing it is probable and can be measured reliably. Where it is not recognised at the acquisition date
but subsequently becomes probable and can be measured reliably, the additional consideration is
treated as an adjustment to the cost of the combination. If such expected future events do not occur, or
the estimate needs to be revised, the cost of the business combination is adjusted accordingly. The
unwinding of any discounting is recognised as a finance cost in profit or loss in the period it arises.

Turnover

The turnover for the Group is comprised of the sale of goods of £25,083k (2023: £25,850k) and
tendering of services of £6,784k (2023: £6,241k).

The whole of the turnover is attributable to the principal activities of the group wholly undertaken in the
United Kingdom.

Investment properties are revalued annually, in accordance with FRS 102, by the directors. Property
data sheets, obtained from a national professional property agency, help to provide market yield
information for valuation purposes. While inherently subject to estimation uncertainty (see note 3), the
method adopted is applied consistently year to year (and has been for an extended period), such that
there is a clear linkage to the rental income earned. |n the period estimated yields have increased (2023:
increased) resulting in a lower (2023: lower) valuation. It is the Directors’ intention to hold these assets
as long-term investments with no foreseeable intention of disposal.

On the historical cost basis the Group net book value of properties carried at valuation is £42,009,000
(2023: £42,009,000). Included within the historic cost of the investment properties are capitalised
interest and bank charges of £918,000 (2023: £918,000).

Included within tangible assets for the Group is non-depreciable land of £6,596,000 (2023: £6,596,000).

On 28 January 2024 the Group undertook a reorganisation to better align trading activities and
associated assets to statutory entities. This led to transfers of shareholdings in subsidiaries held directly
by Jarrold & Sons Limited to subsidiaries of the company. Although having no impact on the
consolidated position of the Group, the company received consideration for certain of the transfers that
has increased the value of its investment. This, together with the acquisition of RDM Distribution
(subsequently renamed Jarrold (Logistics) Limited (see note 29) gives rise to the additions shown in the
table above.

Employee benefits
Defined contribution plans

The amount recognised in profit or loss as an expense in relation to defined contribution plans was
£468,968 (2023: £380,467).

Defined benefit plans

The Group and company also operates a Defined Benefit Pension scheme which, although not
contracted out of the earnings related part of the state pension scheme, cover the Group's obligations
to provide pensions to its retired employees and the current work force. The assets of the fund are held
independently of the Group's finances. All administration expenses of the funds are met by the company
and Group with the exception of investment fees. The Directors consider that the funding arrangements
are satisfactory and adequate to meet the liabilities of the fund. The funding rate of the fund is
determined in accordance with the advice of an independent professional actuary on the basis of
triennial valuation. The latest valuation of the fund was carried out as at 31 January 2020 using the
market valuation approach. Allowance was made for post-retirement pension increases at the rate of
either 2.30% (if pension earned between 5 April 1997 and 31 January 2006) or 3.00% (if pension earned
after 31 January 2006) per annum. At 31 January 2020 the market value of the investments of the fund
was £37,270,000. This was sufficient to cover 103% of the benefits that had accrued to the members
allowing for the future salary increases for active members and other assumptions described below.
Following the introduction of a defined contribution stakeholder plan in 2001, the defined benefit fund
was closed to new entrants as from 30 June 2001. The funding rate of the fund recognises that the fund
is closed to new entrants and whose active membership can therefore be expected to exhibit a steadily
increasing average age profile. The current service cost will increase significantly as the members of
this scheme approach retirement. The plan is now closed to any future accrual of benefit and there are
no active members. :

During the 52-week period ended 29 January 2023 a buy-in arrangement was completed, which is
reflected in the analysis below. See note 3 for further comment on this matter. As part of the transaction
monies paid across to the insurance provider were £0.2m less than the premium needed at inception if
based on data provided to the insurer while agreeing the transaction's terms. While it has subsequently
been confirmed that the lower payment is supported by data and membership changes that arose during
the process of agreeing the transaction's terms, there remains a possibility that an additional sum may
be payable as a contribution. It is not expected to be significant.
