Accounting policies

Company information
Aspire Training Team Limited is a private company limited by shares incorporated in England and Wales.
The registered office is 3 Wollaston Road, Bournemouth, BH6 4AR. .

Accounting convention

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 102 “The Financial Reporting
Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland” (“FRS 102”) and the requirements of the
Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies subject to the small companies regime. The disclosure
requirements of section 1A of FRS 102 have been applied other than where additional disclosure is
required to show a true and fair view.

The financial statements are prepared in sterling, which is the functional currency of the company.
Monetary amounts in these financial statements are rounded to the nearest £.

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention. The principal
accounting policies adopted are set out below.

Reporting period
The current financial statements are prepared for the year ended 31 March 2024.

Turnover

Turnover is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for services provided
in the normal course of business, and is shown net of VAT and other sales related taxes. The fair value
of consideration takes into account trade discounts, settlement discounts and volume rebates.

Intangible fixed assets other than goodwill
Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are recognised at cost and are subsequently
measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.

Amortisation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over
their useful lives on the following bases:

Impairment of fixed assets

At each reporting period end date, the company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and
intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an
impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order
to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the
recoverable amount of an individual asset, the company estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-
generating unit to which the asset belongs.

Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and vatue in use. In assessing value in
use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate
that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset
for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.

If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying
amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit.or loss, unless the relevant asset is carried at a
revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.

Recognised impairment losses are reversed if, and only if, the reasons for the impairment loss have
ceased to apply. Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or
cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the
increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had
no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of
an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless the relevant asset is carried at a
revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents are basic financial assets and include cash in hand, deposits held at call with
banks, other short-term liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, and bank
overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities.

Accounting policies (continued)

Financial instruments
The company has elected to apply the provisions of Section 11 ‘Basic Financial Instruments’ and Section
12 ‘Other Financial Instruments Issues’ of FRS 102 to all of its financial instruments.

Financial instruments are recognised in the company's statement of financial position when the
company becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

Financial assets and liabilities are offset, with the net amounts presented in the financial statements,
when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to
settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Basic financial assets

Basic financial assets, which include debtors, are initially measured at transaction price including
transaction costs and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method
unless the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where the transaction is measured at the
present value of the future receipts discounted at a market rate of interest. Financial assets classified as
receivable within one year are not amortised.

Classification of financial liabilities

Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual
arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the
assets of the company after deducting all of its liabilities.

Basic financial liabilities

Basic financial liabilities, including creditors, bank loans, loans from fellow group companies and
preference shares that are classified as debt, are initially recognised at transaction price unless the
arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where the debt instrument is measured at the present
value of the future payments discounted at a market rate of interest. Financial liabilities classified as
payable within one year are not amortised.

Debt instruments are subsequently carried at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.

Trade creditors are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary
course of business from suppliers. Amounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due
within one year or less. If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities. Trade creditors are
recognised initially at transaction price and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective
interest method.

Equity instruments

Equity instruments issued by the company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of transaction
costs. Dividends payable on equity instruments are recognised as liabilities once they are no longer at
the discretion of the company.

1s Accounting policies (continued)

1.9 Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.

Current tax

The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as
reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or
deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The
company’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the reporting end date.

Deferred tax

Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all timing differences and deferred tax assets are
recognised to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred
tax liabilities or other future taxable profits. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the timing
difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a
transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting end date and reduced to the
extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of
the asset to be recovered. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the
period when the liability is settled, or the asset is realised. Where items recognised in other
comprehensive income or equity are chargeable to or deductible for tax purposes, the resulting current
or deferred tax expense or income is presented in the same component of comprehensive income or
equity as the transaction or other event that resulted iri the tax expense or income. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are offset when the company has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets
and liabilities and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority.

1.10 Employee benefits
The costs of short-term employee benefits are recognised as a liability and an expense, unless those
costs are required to be recognised as part of the cost of stock or fixed assets.

The cost of any unused holiday entitlement is recognised in the period in which the employee’s services
are received.

Termination benefits are recognised immediately as an expense when the company is demonstrably
committed to terminate the employment of an employee or to provide termination benefits.

1.11 Retirement benefits
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall
due.

1.12 Leases
Rentals payable under operating leases, including any lease incentives received, are charged to profit or
loss on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease except where another more systematic
basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leases asset are
consumed. : ,
