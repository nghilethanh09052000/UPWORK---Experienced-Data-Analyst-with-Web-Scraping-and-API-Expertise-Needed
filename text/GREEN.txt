Compliance with accounting standards
The accounts have been prepared in accordance with the provisions of FRS 102 Section 1A Small Entities. There were no material departures from that standard.
3
Accounting policies
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial statements are set out below and have remained unchanged from the previous year, and also have been consistently applied within the same accounts.
Basis of preparation
The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of certain fixed assets.
Presentation currency
The accounts are presented in £ sterling.
Turnover
Turnover is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, excluding discounts, rebates, value added tax and other sales taxes. Turnover from the rendering of services is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract.
Tangible fixed assets and depreciation
Tangible assets are included at cost less depreciation and impairment. Depreciation has been provided at the following rates in order to write off the assets over their estimated useful lives:
Plant & machinery
25% on cost
Motor vehicles
25% on reducing balance
Fixtures & fittings
25% on reducing balance
Computer equipment
33.3% on cost
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax arises as a result of including items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in which they are included in the company's accounts. Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences which result in an obligation to pay more (or less) tax at a future date, at the average tax rates that are expected to apply when the timing differences reverse, based on current tax rates and laws.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Pension costs
The company operates a defined contribution scheme for the benefit of its employees. Contributions payable are recognised in the profit and loss account when due.
Financial instruments
Basic financial instruments are recognised at amortised cost, except for investments in non-convertible preference and non-puttable ordinary shares which are measured at fair value, with changes recognised in profit or loss. Derivative financial instruments are initially recorded at cost and thereafter at fair value with changes recognised in profit or loss.
