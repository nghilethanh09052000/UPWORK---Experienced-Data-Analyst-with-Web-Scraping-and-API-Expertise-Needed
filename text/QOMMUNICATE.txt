Directors' responsibilities statement

The directors are responsible for preparing the Directors’ report and the financial statements in accordance with
applicable law and regulations.

Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors
have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting
Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice), including Financial Reporting Standard 102 ‘The
Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland’. Under company law the directors must not
approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of
the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period.

In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:

. select suitable accounting policies for the Company's financial statements and then apply them consistently;
° make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
. prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the

Company will continue in business.

The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the
Company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and
to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible
for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of
fraud and other irregularities.

Independent Auditor's Report to the Members of Qommunicate Ltd

Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of Qommunicate Ltd (the ‘Company’) for the year ended 31 December 2023,
which comprise the Statement of comprehensive income, the Balance sheet, the Statement of changes in equity and the
related notes, including a summary of significant accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that has been
applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including Financial Reporting
Standard 102 ‘The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland’ (United Kingdom
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

In our opinion the financial statements:

° give a true and fair view of the state of the Company's affairs as at 31 December 2023 and of its loss for the year
then ended;

° have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice: and

° have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law.
Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the
financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the ethical
requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the United Kingdom, including the Financial
Reporting Council's Ethical Standard and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these
requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for
our opinion.

Conclusions relating to going concern

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting
in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or
conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going
concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant
sections of this report.

Independent Auditor's Report to the Members of Qommunicate Ltd (continued)

Other information

The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and
our Auditor's report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the Annual Report.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise
explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. Our responsibility is to read
the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the
financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially
misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine
whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have
performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that
fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006

!n our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

. the information given in the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are
prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
. the Directors’ report has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

Matters on which we are required to report by exception

In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Company and its environment obtained in the course of the
audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the Directors’ report.

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to
report to you if, in our opinion:

. adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received
from branches not visited by us; or

. the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or

° certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or

. we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or

. the directors were not entitled to prepare the financial statements in accordance with the small companies
regime and take advantage of the small companies’ exemption from the requirement to prepare a Strategic
report.

Independent Auditor's Report to the Members of Qommunicate Ltd (continued)

Responsibilities of directors

As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 1, the directors are responsible for the
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal
control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a
going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of
accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic
alternative but to do so.

Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an Auditor's report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with
ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic
decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line
with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The
extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below:

Our approach to identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including fraud
and non-compliance with laws and regulations, was as follows:

e the senior statutory auditor ensured that the engagement team collectively had the appropriate competence,
copabilities and skills to identify or recognise non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations;

e ~=we identified the laws and regulations applicable to the company through discussions with directors and other
management, and from our commercial knowledge and experience of the training sector;

« we focused on specific laws and regulations which we considered may have a direct material effect on the financial
statements or the operations of the company, including the financial reporting legislation, Companies Act 2006,
taxation legislation, anti-bribery, employment, and environmental and health and safety legislation;

« we assessed the extent of compliance with the laws and regulations identified above through making enquiries of
management and inspecting legal correspondence; and

e — identified laws and regulations were communicated within the audit team regularly and the team remained alert to
instances of non-compliance throughout the audit.

We assessed the susceptibility of the company’s financial statements to material misstatement, including obtaining an
understanding of how fraud might occur, by:

¢ making enquiries of management as to where they considered there was susceptibility to fraud, their knowledge of

actual, suspected and alleged fraud; and
¢ considering the internal controls in place to mitigate risks of fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations.

Page 5

Qommunicate Ltd

Independent Auditor's Report to the Members of Qommunicate Ltd (continued)

Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements (continued)
To address the risk of fraud through management bias and override of controls, we:

e performed analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships;

® tested journal entries to identify unusual transactions;

« assessed whether judgements and assumptions made in determining the accounting estimates as set out in note 3
were indicative of potential bias; and

e — investigated the rationale behind significant or unusual transactions.

In response to the risk of irregularities and non-compliance with laws and regulations, we designed procedures which
included, but were not limited to:

* agreeing financial statement disclosures to underlying supporting documentation;

* reading the minutes of meetings of those charged with governance;

*® ~~ enquiring of management as to actual and potential litigation and claims; and

*® reviewing correspondence with HMRC, relevant regulators and the company’s legal advisors.

Because of the inherent limitations of an audit, there is a risk that we will not detect all irregularities, including those
leading to a material misstatement in the financial statements or non-compliance with regulation. This risk increases the
more that compliance with a law or regulation is removed from the events and transactions reflected in the financial
statements, as we will be less likely to become aware of instances of non-compliance. The risk is also greater regarding
irregularities occurring due to fraud rather than error, as fraud involves intentional concealment, forgery, collusion,
omission or misrepresentation.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting
Council's website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our Auditor's report.

Use of our report

This report is made solely to the Company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company's members those
matters we are required to state to them in an Auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted
by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company's members, as
a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

General information

Qommunicate Limited is a private company, limited by shares and registered in England and Wales. The address
of the registered office is Unit 6250 Bishops Court, Birmingham Business Park, Solihull Parkway, Birmingham, B37
7B. The principal activity of the Company is that of the provision of pre-employment and in work training.

Accounting policies

Basis of preparation of financial statements

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention unless -otherwise
specified within these accounting policies and in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102, the
Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and the Republic of Ireland and the Companies Act 2006.

The preparation of financial statements in compliance with FRS 102 requires the use of certain critical
accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise judgement in applying the Company's
accounting policies (see note 3).

The following principal accounting policies have been applied:
Revenue

Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Company
and the revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is measured as the fair value of the consideration
received or receivable, excluding discounts, rebates, value added tax and other sales taxes. The following
criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised:

Rendering of services

Revenue from a contract to provide services is recognised in the period in which the services are provided
in accordance with the stage of completion of the contract when all of the following conditions are satisfied:

. the amount of revenue can be measured reliably:

. it is probable that the Company will receive the consideration due under the contract;

. the stage of completion of the contract at the end of the reporting period can be measured reliably;
and

. the costs incurred and the costs to complete the contract can be measured reliably.

Finance costs

Finance costs are charged to the Statement of comprehensive income over the term of the debt using the
effective interest method so that the amount charged is at a constant rate on the carrying amount.

Accounting policies (continued)

2.6

2.7

2.9

Tangible fixed assets

Tangible fixed assets under the cost model are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and
any accumulated impairment losses. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to
bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner
intended by management.

Depreciation is charged so as to allocate the cost of assets less their residual value over their estimated
useful lives, using the straight line method or reducing balance method.

Depreciation is provided on the following bases:

Motor vehicles - 20% straight line
Furniture and fixtures - 10% reducing balance
Computer equipment - 25% straight line

The assets’ residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted prospectively
if appropriate, or if there is an indication of a significant change since the last reporting date.

Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and
are recognised in profit or loss.

Debtors
Short term debtors are measured at transaction price, less any impairment.
Cash and cash equivalents

Cash is represented by cash in hand and deposits with financial institutions repayable without penalty on
notice of not more than 24 hours. .

Creditors
Creditors are measured at the transaction price.
Leased assets: the Company as lessee

Assets obtained under hire purchase contracts and finance leases are capitalised as tangible fixed assets.
Assets acquired by finance lease are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives.
Assets acquired by hire purchase are depreciated over their useful lives. Finance leases are those where
substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership are assumed by the company. Obligations under
such agreements are included in creditors net of the finance charge allocated to future periods. The finance
element of the rental payment is charged to the Statement of comprehensive income so as to produce a
constant periodic rate of charge on the net obligation outstanding in each period.

Financial instruments

The Company only enters into basic financial instrument transactions that result in the recognition of
financial assets and liabilities like trade and other debtors and creditors, and loans to and from group

undertakings.
Pensions
Defined contribution pension plan

The Company operates a defined contribution plan for its employees. A defined contribution plan is a
pension plan under which the Company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. Once the
contributions have been paid the Company has no further payment obligations.

The contributions are recognised as an expense in the Statement of comprehensive income when they fall
due. Amounts not paid are shown as a liability in the Balance sheet. The assets of the plan are held
separately from the Compony in independently administered funds.

Current and deferred taxation

The tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in profit or loss except
that a charge attributable to an item of income and expense recognised as other comprehensive income or
to an item recognised directly in equity is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in
equity respectively.

The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of tax rates and laws that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date in the countries where the Company operates and
generates income.

Deferred tax balances are recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not
reversed by the balance sheet date, except that:

. The recognition of deferred tax assets is limited to the extent that it is probable that they will be
recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits; and

. Any deferred tax balances are reversed if and when all conditions for retaining associated tax
allowances have been met.

Deferred tax balances are not recognised in respect of permanent differences except in respect of business
combinations, when deferred tax is recognised on the differences between the fair values of assets
acquired and the future tax deductions available for them and the differences between the fair values of
liabilities acquired and the amount that will be assessed for tax. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates
and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.

Accounting policies (continued)

2.12 Provisions for liabilities

Provisions are made where an event has taken place that gives the Company a legal or constructive
obligation that probably requires settlement by a transfer of economic benefit, and a reliable estimate can
be made of the amount of the obligation.

Provisions are charged as an expense to profit or loss in the year that the Company becomes aware of the
obligation, and are measured at the best estimate at the balance sheet date of the expenditure required to
settle the obligation, taking into account relevant risks and uncertainties.

When payments are eventually made, they are charged to the provision carried in the Balance sheet.

Judgements in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty

In the application of the Company's accounting policies, which are described in note 2, the directors are required
to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not
readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical
experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant are as follows:

Trade debtors

An allowance for doubtful debts is maintained for estimates losses resulting from the inability of the Company's
customers to make required payment. The allowance is based on the Company's regular assessment of the
credit worthiness and financial condition of customers.

Accrued income .
Income is accrued based on management's assessment of whether trainees are expected to sit exams and
whether customers are expected to confirm progression of trainees, based on available historic data and
knowledge of trainees and customers.

Actual results could differ from those estimated. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an
ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if
the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both
current and future periods.
