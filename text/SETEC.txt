Notes to the Abridged Financial Statements
Year ended 31 December 2023
1.
General information
The company is a private company limited by shares, registered in England and Wales. The address of the registered office is 11 Mallard Way, Pride Park, Derby, DE24 8GX.
2.
Statement of compliance
These abridged financial statements have been prepared in compliance with Section 1A of FRS 102, 'The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and the Republic of Ireland'.
3.
Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, as modified by the revaluation of certain financial assets and liabilities and investment properties measured at fair value through profit or loss.
The financial statements are prepared in sterling, which is the functional currency of the entity.
Consolidation
The company has taken advantage of the option not to prepare consolidated abridged financial statements contained in Section 398 of the Companies Act 2006 on the basis that the company and its subsidiary undertakings comprise a small group.
Revenue recognition
Turnover is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods supplied and services rendered, net of discounts and Value Added Tax. Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the buyer (usually on despatch of the goods); the amount of revenue can be measured reliably; it is probable that the associated economic benefits will flow to the entity; and the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transactions can be measured reliably.
Income tax
The taxation expense represents the aggregate amount of current and deferred tax recognised in the reporting period. Tax is recognised in profit or loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, tax is recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively. Current tax is recognised on taxable profit for the current and past periods. Current tax is measured at the amounts of tax expected to pay or recover using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences at the reporting date. Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits. Deferred tax is measured using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date that are expected to apply to the reversal of the timing difference.
Tangible assets
Tangible assets are initially recorded at cost, and subsequently stated at cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Any tangible assets carried at revalued amounts are recorded at the fair value at the date of revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses. An increase in the carrying amount of an asset as a result of a revaluation, is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity, except to the extent it reverses a revaluation decrease of the same asset previously recognised in profit or loss. A decrease in the carrying amount of an asset as a result of revaluation, is recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent of any previously recognised revaluation increase accumulated in equity in respect of that asset. Where a revaluation decrease exceeds the accumulated revaluation gains accumulated in equity in respect of that asset, the excess shall be recognised in profit or loss.
Depreciation
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost or valuation of an asset, less its residual value, over the useful economic life of that asset as follows:
Motor vehicles
-
25
%
reducing balance
Equipment
-
33
%

Impairment of fixed assets
A review for indicators of impairment is carried out at each reporting date, with the recoverable amount being estimated where such indicators exist. Where the carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount, the asset is impaired accordingly. Prior impairments are also reviewed for possible reversal at each reporting date. For the purposes of impairment testing, when it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, an estimate is made of the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. The cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that includes the asset and generates cash inflows that largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. For impairment testing of goodwill, the goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the company are assigned to those units.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the entity has an obligation at the reporting date as a result of a past event, it is probable that the entity will be required to transfer economic benefits in settlement and the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably. Provisions are recognised as a liability in the abridged statement of financial position and the amount of the provision as an expense. Provisions are initially measured at the best estimate of the amount required to settle the obligation at the reporting date and subsequently reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate of the amount that would be required to settle the obligation. Any adjustments to the amounts previously recognised are recognised in profit or loss unless the provision was originally recognised as part of the cost of an asset. When a provision is measured at the present value of the amount expected to be required to settle the obligation, the unwinding of the discount is recognised as a finance cost in profit or loss in the period it arises.
Defined contribution plans
Contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as an expense in the period in which the related service is provided. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that the prepayment will lead to a reduction in future payments or a cash refund. When contributions are not expected to be settled wholly within 12 months of the end of the reporting date in which the employees render the related service, the liability is measured on a discounted present value basis. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as a finance cost in profit or loss in the period in which it arises.
