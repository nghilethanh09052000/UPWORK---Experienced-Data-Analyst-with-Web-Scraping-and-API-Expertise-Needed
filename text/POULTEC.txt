Notes to the financial statements

Year ended 31 July 2024

1. General information
The company is a private company limited by shares, registered in UK. The address of the registered
office is Poultec Training Limited, South Green Park Enterprise Centre, South Green, Mattishall,
Dereham, NR20 3JY, Norfolk.

2. Statement of compliance
These financial statements have been prepared in compliance with Section 1A of FRS 102, 'The
Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and the Republic of Ireland’.

3. Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, as modified by the.
revaluation of certain financial assets and liabilities and investment properties measured at fair value
through profit or loss.
The financial statements are prepared in sterling, which is the functional currency of the entity.

Cash flow statement

In the opinion of the directors the company qualifies as a small company and accordingly a cash flow
statement is not required.

Revenue recognition

Turnover is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods supplied
and services rendered, net of discounts and Value Added Tax.

Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership

have transferred to the buyer (usually on despatch of the goods); the amount of revenue can be

_.. .measured reliably; it-is probable that: the associated economic benefits will flow to the entity; and the
costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transactions can be measured reliably.

Taxation

Provision is made, under the liability method, to take account of timing differences between the
treatment of certain items for accounts purposes and their treatment for tax purposes. Tax deferred or
accelerated is accounted for in respect of all timing differences.

Operating leases

Lease payments are recognised as an expense over the tease term on a straight-line basis. The
aggregate benefit of lease incentives is recognised as a reduction to expense over the lease term, on
a straight-line basis.

Intangible assets

Intangible assets are initially recorded at cost, and are subsequently stated at cost less any
accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Any intangible assets carried at revalued amounts,
are recorded at the fair value at the date of revaluation, as determined by reference to an active
market, less any subsequent accumulated amortisation and subsequent accumulated impairment
losses.

Accounting policies (continued)
Intangible assets (continued)

Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are only recognised separately from
goodwill when they arise from contractual or other legal rights, are separable, the expected future
economic benefits are probable and the cost or value can be measured reliably.

Amortisation

Amortisation is calculated so as to write off the cost of an asset, less its estimated residual value, over
the useful life of that asset as follows:

Website costs - Fully amortised

If there is an indication that there has been a significant change in amortisation rate, useful life or
residual value of an intangible asset, the amortisation is revised prospectively to reflect the new
estimates.

Tangible assets

Tangible assets are initially recorded at cost, and subsequently stated at cost less any accumulated
depreciation and impairment losses. Any tangible assets carried at revalued amounts are recorded at
the fair value at the date of revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and
subsequent accumulated impairment losses.

An increase in the carrying amount of an asset as a result of a revaluation, is recognised in other
comprehensive income and accumulated in equity, except to the extent it reverses a revaluation
decrease of the same asset previously recognised in profit or loss. A decrease in the carrying amount
of an asset as a result of revaluation, is recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent of
any previously recognised revaluation increase accumulated in equity in respect of that asset. Where
a revaluation decrease exceeds the accumulated revaluation gains accumulated in equity in respect
of that asset, the excess shall be recognised in profit or loss.

Depreciation

Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost or valuation of an asset, less its residual value,
over the useful economic life of that asset as follows:

Gym equipment - 25% reducing balance

Fixtures and fittings - 25% reducing balance

Motor vehicles - 25% reducing balance

Training equipment - 33% straight line and 10% reducing balance
Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the entity has an obligation at the reporting date as a result of a past
event, it is probable that the entity will be required to transfer economic benefits in settlement and the
amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably. Provisions are recognised as a liability in the
statement of financial position and the amount of the provision as an expense.

Provisions are initially measured at the best estimate of the amount required to settle the obligation at
the reporting date and subsequently reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted to reflect the
current best estimate of the amount that would be required to settle the obligation. Any adjustments to
the amounts previously recognised are recognised in profit or loss unless the provision was originally
recognised as part of the cost of an asset. When a provision is measured at the present value of the
amount expected to be required to settle the obligation, the unwinding of the discount is recognised as
a finance cost in profit or loss in the period it arises.

3. Accounting policies (continued)
Defined contribution plans
Contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as an expense in the period in which the
related service is provided. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that the
prepayment will lead to a reduction in future payments or a cash refund.
When contributions are not expected to be settled wholly within 12 months of the end of the reporting’
date in which the employees render the related service, the liability is measured on a discounted
present value basis. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as a finance cost in profit or loss in
the period in which it arises.

4. Employee numbers
The average number of employees during the year was 37 (2023: 37).
