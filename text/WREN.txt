Wren Kitchens Limited (Registered Number: 06799478)

STRATEGIC REPORT

for the year ended 31 December 2023

The directors present their strategic
report for the year ended 31 December
2023.

PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES AND
REVIEW OF THE BUSINESS

The principal activities of the company are
the manufacture, retail and installation
of kitchens, bedrooms, solid surface
worktops and associated products.

The directors are satisfied with the
company’s performance for the year.

As expected, following two years of
exceptionai growth, as demand surged
post the global pandemic, the kitchen
market experienced some normalisation
in 2023. This situation was exacerbated
by elevated interest rates and the cost of
living pressures faced by all consumers.
Despite these factors, the company's
turnover remained broadly similar to
the year before at £967,356,626 (2022:
£1,065,289,642)

As part of the long-term business
plan, the company has over recent
years been investing significantly in its
manufacturing facilities. In 2023 the
company's new state of the art kitchen
manufacturing plant in Barton upon
Humber became fully operational and
works have also been completed to the
company’s bedroom manufacturing
plant in Howden. These investments
were necessary not only for the continued
expansion into the UK retail market but
also to give the business the necessary
capacity to begin a push into new
markets including the -contract kitchen
market.

The additional manufacturing plant
has allowed the business to spread its
operations across multiple locations
reducing the risk of disruption to our
supply. chain from an incident at any
one site, again this was a key element

of the long-term business plan as the
business evolves. Inevitably, and indeed
as identified in last year's strategic
report, multiple production sites and the
significant additional capacity means
that in the short term there is some
duplication of costs until the volumes
grow and the new plant can operate
efficiently. Whilst this has not had an
impact on the gross profit percentage, it
has affected our EBITDA which in the year
under review amounted to £116,997,021
(2022: £150,492,359)

The expansion of the company’s retail
network slowed during the year under
review as the focus has been on building
the manufacturing capacity the directors
feel is necessary to meet future demand
both in the UK and at a group level in the
USA. As a,result, only two new showrooms
opened in the UK, one in St Helens and
the other in Kidderminster. This brings
the total number of showrooms in the UK
toTl0 which is less than half of the number
of showrooms of our major competitors.
There remains significant areas of the UK
where the company has no presence and
where customers cannot easily reach us.
Additional locations have been identified
and sites are being sought to address this
issue but as has always been the case,
new properties will only be taken on if the
commercial terms are appropriate.

KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
The directors monitor the group's
performance using both financial and
non-financial performance measures.
From a financial point of view, key
performance indicators for the company
include turnover, gross profit, EBITDA
and profit before tax. EBITDA is calculated
as profit on ordinary activities before
tax adjusted by adding back interest,
depreciation -and amortisation. These
values can be found in the notes to the
financial statements.

STRATEGIC REPORT (continued)

for the year ended 31 December 2023

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Asummary of the last five years’ trading is detailed below:
2023 2022 2021 2020 2019
£000 £000 £000 £000 £’000
TURNOVER 967,357 1,065,290 916487 703,119 612,661
GROSS PROFIT 468,226 $127,327 445621 342,659 299483
EBITDA 116,997 150,492 136,364 107401 91,052
PROFIT BEFORE TAX 74,834 ; 112,248 100,586 75,313 65,184
FINANCIAL POSITION higher stock level until it has more clarity

At 31 December 2023 the net assets of the
business amounted to £274,900,989 (2022:
£261,510,930).

The company has continued with its policy
of re-investment to ensure that it is in a
position to take advantage of opportunities
to grow further and to reinforce its position
as the country's largest kitchen retailer and
to expand into the fitted bedroom market.

A new milestone was reached in 2023 as the
company invested a further £42,664,109 into
the fixed assets of the business, principally
into the manufacturing sites in Barton Upon
Humber. This means that since formation the
company has re-invested over half a billion
pounds into its infrastructure here in the UK.

There remains significantuncertainty in the
world whether that be asa result of conflict
or other macroeconomic factors. In light of
these risks the company continued with
its policy of holding significantly higher
stock fevels than would traditionally be the
case. The directors believe this continues
to be the correct course of action, but the
decision did however mean that at the
year end the company was holding stock
of £54,866,321 (2022: 57,954,633). Due to
the company's Just in Time manufacturing
model, the vast majority of this stock is
held in the form of raw materials and
work in progress and less than a third of
that number represents finished goods
stock, all of which is produced for a specific
customer and is simply awaiting despatch.
The company intends to maintain this

regarding the strength and security of the
global supply chain.

The directors have paid close attention
to the company’s cash management
throughout the year. Action has been taken
where necessary, but the directors have also
been conscious of the need to, continue
investing in the future and ensuring that the
group is able to continue its expansion both
in the UK and the USA. The directors are
significantly assisted in this process by the
long-term approach of the shareholders.

During the year the group enacted an
internal corporate restructure. The West
Retail Group Limited (the previous direct
parent of Wren Kitchens Limited) has
transferred its shareholding in the company
to Wren Group Limited. This was enacted
by means of a share for share exchange. As
a result, at the period end, the company's
immediate parent is now Wren Group
Limited, with the ultimate parent entity
remaining as The West Retail Group Limited.
As a step in this restructure, the company
redeemed Preference Shares held by The
West Retail Group for a total of £26,000,000.

FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS

The directors remain confident in the
company’s strategy and believe that
significant opportunities exist to expand the
company’s operations and activities in the
UK and abroad. Additional retail locations
have beencommittec to and willbe opening
in 2024. All of the existing showrooms been
comprehensively re-fitted throughout 2024

and are now able to provide customers
with the opportunity to see a full range of
bedroom furniture. Significant costs has
been imcurred in ensuring that all of the
retail team have been through bedroom
design training and are therefore able to
provide our customers with inspirational
designs. With those foundations now firmly
in place, the company will begin its drive
into the bedroom market and whilst we
would expect to a see only. a moderate level
of sales in 2024 we would expect reasonable
growth in this market thereafter.

in the second half of 2023, the company
began to invest in its new contract kitchen
division. Senior personnel were recruited
to head up that division and they in turn
recruited a full team of contract managers.
New product lines have been developed
and launched specifically for this market
and the company is confident that it is
able to offer a unique proposition to the
contract kitchen market. The costs for this
project:were written off in the year and will
continue to be written off as incurred. The
company does not expect the division to
be immediately revenue generative as the
nature of these large projects is that tenders
are sent.out and awarded far in advance but
initial feedback is encouraging.

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND
UNCERTAINTIES

The principal risks faced by the company are
similar to those faced by other major retailers
of big-ticket items. The kitchen market is
highly competitive, and the company must
therefore be alert to changes in consumer
trends, the actions of its competitors and
to new entrants to the market. In addition,
the business closely monitors the impact
of inflationary pressures on both consumer
demand and the cost of raw materials
used in manufacturing kitchens. The risks
identified are, to some extent, mitigated by
the company controlling much of its supply
chain, and equally the company does not
hold large stocks of finished products and
because it manufactures its own products
it is able to adapt quickly to changes in
market trends or new product launches by
competitors. By constantly developing its
showrooms and the bespoke technology

which is used by the retail team to plan and
sell kitchens, the company aims to be at the
forefront of change rather than following.

The company must also be alert to the
impact of general economic factors and how
those changes will affect our customers. The
company seeks to mitigate any such risks by
continually reviewing its processes to identify
opportunities to improve its efficiency
and the value it offers its customers. These
risks are also mitigated by ensuring that all
financial investments are in line with the
company’s business plan and that costs and
cash flows are carefully monitored.

CREDIT RISK

The company has implemented procedures
to minimise the company's exposure to bad
debts. The majority of revenue is derived
from the sale of goods to the end consumer
and these goods are paid for prior to
despatch.:Credit checks and insurance is in
place for sales to trade customers and there
is very little concentration with no single
customer accounting for a significant
proportion of the company’s revenue.

LIQUIDITY AND CASH FLOW RISK
The directors regularly review the
company’s cash position and its future cash
flow forecasts.

The company has a strong balance sheet,
significant cash reserves and the nature
of the business is highly cash generative.
Whilst it has continued to take advantage
of favourable rates in respect of commercial
vehicle financing, other than this finance,
the company does not borrow from banks
or third-party financial institutions.

The company is also part of The WEST Retail
Group Limited and has access to additional
funding through the group should it be
required, Overall, therefore the directors do
not believe that the company is exposed to
a significant risk in this regard.

Reporting) Regulations 2018 corporate

* RESPONSIBILITIES

Wren Kitchens Limited (Registered Number: 06799478)

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES

for the year ended 31 December 2023

The directorsare responsible for preparing
the Strategic Report, the Directors’
Report and the financial statements
in accordance with applicable law and
regulation.

Company law requires the directors to
prepare financial statements for each
financial year. Under that Jaw the directors
have prepared the financial statements
in accordance with Wnited Kingdom
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice
(United Kingdom Accounting Standards,
comprising FRS 102 “The Financial
Reporting Standard applicable in the UK
and Republic of Ireland”, and applicable
law).

Under company law, directors must not
approve the financial statements unless
they are satisfied that they give a true
and fair view of the state of affairs of the
company and of the profit or loss of the
company for that period. In preparing the
financial statements, the directors are
required to:

select suitable accounting policies
and then apply them consistently;

make judgements and accounting
estimates that are reasonable and
prudent;

state whether applicable United
Kingdom Accounting Standards
have been followed, subject to any
material departures disclosed and
explained in the financialstatements;

assess the company’s ability to
continue as a going concern
disclosing, as applicable, matters
related to going concern;

use the going concern basis of
accounting unless they either
intend to liquidate the company or
to: cease operations, or have’ no
realistic alternative but to do so.

The directors are responsible for keeping
adequate accounting records that
are sufficient to show and explain the
company's transactions and disclose
with reasonable accuracy at any time the
financial position of the company and
enable them to ensure that the financial
statements comply with the Companies
Act 2006.They are responsible for such
internal control as they determine is
necessary to enable the preparation
of financial statements that are. free
from material misstatement, whether
due to fraud or error, and have general
responsibility for taking such steps as are
reasonably open to them to safeguard
the assets of the company and to prevent
and detect fraud and other irregularities.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT

Wren Kitchens Limited (Registered Number: 06799478)

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS
OF WREN KITCHENS LIMITED

OPINION

We have audited the financial
statements of Wren Kitchens Limited
(‘the company’) for the year ended 31
December 2023 which comprise the
statement of comprehensive income, the
balance sheet, the statement of changes
in equity, and related notes, including the
accounting policies in note 2.

In our opinion the financial statements:

give a true and fair view of the
state of the company’s affairs as at 31
December 2023 and ofits profitforthe
year then ended;

have been properly prepared in
accordance with UK accounting
standards, including FRS 102
The Financial Reporting Standard
applicable in the UK and Republic of
Ireland; and

have been prepared in accordance
with the requirements of the
Companies Act 2006.

BASIS FOR OPINION

We conducted our audit in accordance
with International Standards on Auditing
(UK) (“ISAs (UK)") and applicable law. Our
responsibilities are described below. We
have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities
under, independent of the
company in accordance with, UK ethical

and are

requirements including the FRC Ethical
Standard as applied to other entities of
public interest. We believe that the audit
evidence we have obtained is a sufficient
and appropriate basis for our opinion.

GOING CONCERN

The directors have prepared the financial
statements on the going concern basis
as they do not intend to liquidate the
company or to cease their operations,
and as they have concluded that the
company's financial position means that
this is realistic. They have also concluded
that there are no material uncertainties

that could have cast significant doubt
over their ability to continue as a going
concern for at least a year from the date
of approval of the financial statements
("the going concern period”).

We used our knowledge of the company,
its industry, and the general economic
environment to identify the inherent risks
to its business model and analysed how
those risks might affect the company's
financial resources or ability to continue
operations over the going concern period.

The risks that we considered most likely to
adversely affect the company's available
financial resources over this period'were:

a decline in consumer confidence as
a result of cost of living crisis;

the impact of a significant business
continuity affecting the
company's manufacturing facilities

issue

or those of its suppliers;

the impact of current economic
environment on the company's
supply chain.

We also considered less predictable but
realistic second order impacts, such as
possible impacts from the potential
recession of the UK economy.

We considered whether these risks could
plausibly affect the liquidity in the going
concern period by comparing severe, but
plausible, downside scenarios that could
arise from these risks individually and
collectively against the level of available
financial indicated by the company's
financial forecasts.

We considered whether the going
concern disclosure in note 2 to the
financial statements gives a full and
accurate description of the directors’
assessment of going concern, including
the identified risks, dependencies, and
related sensitivities.

PENIDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT

Wren Kitchens Limited (Registered Number: 06799478)

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS
OF WREN KITCHENS LIMITED (continued)

Our conclusions based on this work:

we consider that the directors’ use of
the going concern basis of
accounting in the preparation of the
financial statements is appropriate;

we have not identified, and concur
with the directors’ assessment that
there is not, a material uncertainty
related to events or conditions that,
individually or collectively, may cast
significant doubt on the company's
ability to continue as a going concern
for the going concern period; and
we found the going concern
disclosure in note 2 to be acceptable.

However, as we cannot predict ail future
events or conditions and as subsequent
events may result in outcomes that
are inconsistent with judgements that
were reasonable at the time they were

made, the above conclusions are not |

a@ guarantee that the company will
continue in operation.

FRAUD AND BREACHES OF LAWS
AND REGULATIONS - ABILITY TO
DIRECT

Identifying and responding to risks of
material misstatement due to fraud.

To identify risks of material misstatement
due to fraud ("fraud risks"} we assessed
events or conditions that could indicate an
incentive or pressure to commit fraud or
provide an opportunity to commit fraud.

Our risk assessment procedures included:

enquiring of directors and inspection
or policy documentation as to The
WEST Retail Group Limited's policies
and procedures to prevent and
detect fraud that apply to this group
company as well as enquiring
whether the directors have
knowledge of any actual, suspected
or alleged fraud;

reading Board minutes;

considering remuneration incentive
schemes and performance targets; and

using analytical procedures to
identify unusual or unexpected
relationships.

We communicated identified fraud
risks throughout the audit team and
remained alert to any indications of fraud
throughout the audit.

As required by auditing standards, and
taking into account possible pressures to
meet profit targets, we perform procedures
to address the risk of management override
of controls and the risk of fraudulent
revenue recognition, in particular:

the risk that revenue is overstated
by being recorded in the wrong
period; and

the risk that management may be
in a position to make inappropriate
accounting entries.

We did not identify any additional fraud
risks.

In determining the audit procedures
we took into account the results of our
evaluation of some of company-wide
fraud risk management controls and

* performed procedures including:

identifying journal entries and other
adjustments to test based on risk
criteria and comparing the identified
entries to supporting
documentation. These included
posted to unusual accounts involving
revenue and cash accounts.

for a sample of revenue transactions
around the period end, vouching to
supporting external documentation
to corroborate whether those items
were recorded in the correct
accounting period.

identifying and responding to risks
of material misstatement related to
compliance with laws and regulations.

We identified areas of laws and
regulations that could reasonably be
expected to have a material effect on the
financial statements from our general

commercial and sector experience and
through discussion with the directors
(as required by auditing: standards) and
discussed with the directors the policies
and procedures regarding compliance
with laws and regulations.

We communicated identified laws and
regulations throughout our team and
remained alert to any indications of non-
compliance throughout the audit.

The potential effect of these laws and
regulations on the financial statements
varies considerably.

Firstly, the company is subject to laws
and regulations that directly affect the
financial statements including financial
reporting legislation (including related
companies _ legislation}, distributable
profits legislation and taxation legislation
and we assessed the extent of compliance
with these laws and regulations as part of
our procedures on the related financial
statement items.

Secondly, the company is subject to many
other laws and regulations where the
consequences of non-compliance could
have a material effect on amounts or
disclosures in the financial staternents, for
instance through the imposition of fines or
litigation. We identified the following areas
as those most likely to have such an effect
health and safety, anti-bribery, employment
law and certain aspects of company
legislation, recognising the nature of the
company’s activities. Auditing standards
limit the required audit procedures to
identify non-compliance with these
laws and regulations to enquiry of the
directors inspection of regulatory and legal
correspondence, if any. Therefore, if a breach
of operational regulations is not disclosed to
usor evident from relevant correspondence,
an audit will not detect that breach.

Context of the ability of the audit to detect
fraud or breaches of law or regulation.

Owing to the inherent limitations of an
audit, there is an unavoidable risk that

we may not have detected some material
misstatementsinthefinancialstatements,
even though we have properly planned
and performed our audit in accordance
with auditing standards. For example, the
further removed non-compliance with
laws and regulations is from the events
and transactions reflected in the financial
statements, the less likely the inherently
limited procedures required by auditing
standards would identify it.

In addition, as with any audit, there
temained a higher risk ‘of non-
detection of fraud, as these may involve
collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,
misrepresentations, or the override of
internal controls. Our audit procedures
designed to detect
misstatement. We are not responsible

are material
for preventing non-compliance or fraud
and cannot be expected to detect non-
compliance with all {jaws and regulations.

STRATEGIC REPORT AND
DIRECTORS’ REPORT

The directors are responsible for the
Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report.
Our opinion on the financial statements
does not cover those reports and we do
not express an audit opinion thereon.

Our responsibility is to read the Strategic
Report and the Directors’ Report and,
in doing so, consider whether, based
on our financial statements audit work,

the information therein is materially
misstated of inconsistent with the
financial statements or our audit

knowledge. Based solely on that work.

we have not identified material
misstatements in the Strategic
Report and the Directors’ Report;

in our opinion the information given
in those reports for the financial
year is consistent with the financial
statements; and

in our opinion those reports have
been prepared in accordance with
the Companies Act 2006.

remuneration specified by jaw are
not made; or

information and explanations we
require for our audit.

We have nothing to report in these
respects.

necessary to enable the preparation of
financial statements that are free from
material misstatement, whether due to
fraud or error: assessing the company’s
ability to continue as a going concern,
disclosing, as applicable, matters related
to going concern; and using the going
concern basis of accounting unless they
either intend to liquidate the company or
to cease operations, or have no realistic
alternative but to do so.

AUDITOR'S RESPONSIBILITIES

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial
statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to
fraud or error, and to issue our opinionin

is a high level of assurance, but does not
guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with ISAs (UK) will always
detect a material misstatement when
it exists. Misstatements can arise from
fraud or errorandareconsidered material
if, individually or in aggregate, they could
reasonably be expected to influence the
economic decisions of users taken on the
basis of the financial statements.

A fuller description of our responsibilities
is provided on the FRC'’s website at

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

Wren Kitchens Limited (Registered Number: 06799478)

NOTES TO THE. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

for the year ended 31 December 2023

1. STATUTORY INFORMATION

Wren Kitchens Limited is a_ private
company limited by shares, registered
in England and Wales. The company’s
registered number and registered office
address can be found on the Company
Information page.

2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of preparation of financial
statements

The financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with applicable
accounting standards including Financial
Reporting Standard 102 The Financial
Reporting Standard Applicable in the
UK and Republic of Irelamd (FRS 102) and
the Companies Act 2006. The financial
statements have been prepared on a
going concern basis under the historical
cost convention, modified to include
certain items at fair value.

The significant accounting — policies
applied in the preparation of these
financia! statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently
applied to all years presented unless
otherwise stated.

Going concern

The financial statermemts have been
prepared on a going concern basis which
the directors consider to be appropriate.
The directors have prepared cash flow
forecasts for a period of at least 12 months
from the date of approval of these
financial statements. These base case
forecasts have then been stress tested for
sensitivity. In each scenario considered,
the company will have sufficient funds to
meet its liabilities as they fall due.

The company has previously used
asset finance to fund the growth in its
transport fleet as this approach mirrors
the ownership life of the assets

Other than this the company has no
third-party borrowings. The forecasting
scenarios do not indicate any new
facilities will be required.

At the balance sheet date, the company
had net current assets of £37.5m although
this includes intercompany debt of
£128.0m which falls due for payment
after more than one year. This has been
considered as part of the going concern
assessment but is not. considered an
issue given the significant amount of
profitability and cash generation in the
forecast period, which will bridge this
temporary net current liabilities position.
Within net current liabilities are deferred
lease incentives and deferred income in
excess of £88m which will not result in a
cash outflow which further demonstrates
that working capital levels are more than
sufficient. Cash balances at the time of
approving these financial statements
were in excess of £36m.

Consequently, the directors are confident
that the company will have sufficient
funds to continue to meet its liabilities
as they fall due for at least 12 months
from the date of approval of the financial
statements and therefore have prepared
the financial statements on a going
concern basis.

Financial Reporting Standard 102-
reduced disclosure exemptions

The company has taken advantage of
the following disclosure exemptions in
preparing these financial statements,
as permitted by FRS 102 “The Financial
Reporting Standard applicable in the UK
and Republic of Ireland”:

the requirements of Section
7 Statement of Cash Flows;

the requirement of paragraph 3.17(d):

the requirement of paragraph 33.7.

incurred or to be incurred in respect of
the transaction can be measured reliably.
This is usually on delivery of the goods to
the customer or on completion of any
contract including third-party services
such as installation.

For the sale of kitchens and bedrooms
the company also offers customers an
installation service. Where the contract
with the customer includes an installation
service, the revenue in respect of that
contract is recognised on completion of
the installation service which is of a short-
term nature.

progress, cost includes an appropriate
share of overheads based on normal
operating capacity. Costs outside of

measured using tax rates and laws that
have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the year end and that are
expected to apply to the reversal of the
timing difference.

contracts or finance leases are capitalised
in the balance sheet. Those held under
hire purchase contracts are depreciated
over their estimated useful lives. Those
held under finance leases are depreciated

changes in the estimated
economic lives of the assets. The useful

useful

economic lives are re-assessed annually

fixed assets and note 2 for the useful
economic lives for each class of asset.

estimates for any associated provision
required. When calculating the stock
provision management considers the
nature, age, and condition of its stock in
addition to assumptions around future
usage of raw materials and finished
goods.

Amounts owed by group undertakings.

recoverability of amounts owing from
group undertakings. The loans due from
Wren US Holdings Inc relate to funding of
the initial growth and US expansion. This
is in accordance with the group's business
plan and repayment of the debt will be
in the medium term. In undertaking
this assessment management has
considered future anticipated growth
plans, experience in the United Kingdom

has

and financial forecasts which indicate
the group companies will generate
profits and cash to repay the debt. Clearly
these forecasts include judgemental
assumptions and estimates, particularly
around expansion and growth rates for
