Strategic report
for the year ended 31 December 2023

The directors present their Strategic report of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2023.
Principal activities

The Company’s principal activity is to act as a holding company for the Group and undertake central
service functions to support the subsidiary undertakings in the delivery of their principal activity of
provision of children’s services. ,

Business review

The Company's profit for the financial year was £10;686,000 (2022: £10,740,000).

The results for the year and final position of the Company are as shown in the financial statements
on pages 11 to 28.

Future developments

The Company will continue to invest in the recruitment, training and retention of foster parents and
social workers. This will enable the company to continue to provide best-in-class fostering services,
delivering exceptional outcomes to children and young people, and working in close co-operation
with local authority partners.

Key performance indicators (“KPIs”)

The Company uses a range of key performance indicators (KPls) to measure the effectiveness of
operational and financial performance. The KPls focus on the quality of provision to ensure that
placements are successful and positive outcomes are achieved, as well as financial performance.
These KPIs are monitored on a weekly and monthly basis.

Risk Management

Operational risk management

Nutrius UK TOPCO Limited (‘The Group’) sets out the risk management policies and in turn, Nutrius
Central Services Limited delivers and supports the operational risk management for the wider group
including centrally managed Quality Assurance and Safeguarding, Finance, Human Resources and
Information Technology functions. ;

The Group operates its policies and procedures in line with the new Data Protection Act 2018.
Financial risk management

The Group's operations expose it.to a variety of financial risks that include price risk, credit risk,
liquidity risk, cash flow and interest rate risk. The Company has in place a risk management
programme that seeks to limit the adverse effects on the financial performance of the Company by
monitoring levels of income, expenditure and liquidity.

Price risk

The Group is responsive to the needs of its customers, working in partnership with them to ensure
that services provided deliver exceptional placement outcomes and are value for money. This
supports customers in working within their financial budget whilst receiving a high quality service.

Credit risk

Almost all of the Group’s customers are local authorities and as such this risk is considered to be
relatively low.

Strategic report
for the year ended 31 December 2023 (Continued)

risk is considered to be relatively low. The level of the Company’s ‘Porrowing facilities are actively
reviewed by management.

Cash flow and interest rate risk
The Company prepares monthly cash flow projections monitoring funds available in order to manage
this exposure.

NUTRIUS CENTRAL SERVICES LIMITED

Directors’ report
for the year ended 31 December 2023

The directors present their Directors report and audited financial statements of the Company for the
year ended 31 December 2023.

Results

The Company's profit on ordinary activities after taxation for the financial year ended 31 December
2023 is £10,686,000 (2022: £10,740,000).

Dividends
The directors have not recommended a dividend. No dividends were paid in 2023 (2022: ENil).
Going Concern

The company is a member of the Nutrius UK BIDCO Group and is a party to the financing
arrangements of the wider Group. Hence the Directors have assessed the future funding
requirements of the Company through the consideration of financial forecasts for the Group for at
least 12 months from the date of signing these financial statements. Taking into account the current
and anticipated financial performance of the Group and Company the forecasts include an
assessment of the impact of severe but plausible downsides on the future trading performance of the
group.

The Group manages its liquidity needs through a combination of working capital (including cash
balances) and long term senior debt facilities, the latter of which includes certain quarterly covenant
tests. The company is subject to cross party guarantees for bank debt due by the Group (see Note
18). The long term senior debt facilities are due to mature in April 2025 and October 2025 and the
Group has secured new debt facilities to refinance these existing facilities.

The Group monitors its debt servicing requirements through the daily and weekly assessment of the
business performance including cashflows. Forecasts have been assessed against current and
future debt servicing payments and quarterly covenant tests.

The forecasts indicate that the Group and therefore the Company has sufficient facilities and
covenant headroom to meet is liabilities as they fall due for at least 12 months from the date of the
financial statements even in the severe but plausible scenario. On this basis the Directors consider
it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing these financial statements.

Directors

The directors of the Company who were in office during the financial year under review and up to the
date of signing the financial statements were:

J August
J Clark

The directors benefit from qualifying third party indemnity provisions in place during the financial year
and at the date of this report.

Charitable contributions and political donations

The Company made charitable contributions during the year of £Nil (2022: ENil).
Employee involvement

The Company's policy is to consult and discuss with employees, through unions, staff councils and
at meetings, matters likely to affect employees’ interests.

Information on matters of concern to employees is given through information bulletins and reports
which seek to achieve a common awareness on the part of all employees of the financial and
economic factors affecting the Company's performance.


NUTRIUS CENTRAL SERVICES LIMITED

Directors’ report
for the year ended 31 December 2023 (continued)

Future developments

The future developments of the Company are discussed within the Strategic report.

Financial Risk Management

The Company's approach to financial risk management is discussed within the Strategic report.
Employment of disabled persons

The Company's policy is to recruit disabled workers for those vacancies that they are able to fill. All
necessary assistance with initial training courses is given. Once employed, a career plan is developed
so as to ensure suitable opportunities for each disabled person. Arrangements are made, wherever
possible, for retraining employees who become disabled, to enable them to perform work identified
as appropriate to their aptitudes and abilities.

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES IN RESPECT OF STRATEGIC REPORT, THE
DIRECTORS’ REPORT AND THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic Report, the Directors’ Report and the financial
statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.

Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland.

Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied
that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the
Company for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:

departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements;

related to going concern; and

The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and
explain the Company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial
position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the
Companies Act 2006. They are responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary
to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether

NUTRIUS CENTRAL SERVICES LIMITED

Independent auditors’ report to the members of Nutrius Central
Services Limited

Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Nutrius Central Services Limited (“the Company’) for

the year ended 31 December 2023 which comprise the Profit and Loss Account, Balance Sheet,
Statement of Changes in Equity, and related notes, including the accounting policies in note 1.

in our opinion the financial statements:

e give a true and fair view of the state of the Company's affairs as at 31 December 2023 and of its
profit for the year then ended;

e have been properly prepared in accordance with UK accounting standards, including FRS 102
The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of freland; and

e have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”)
and applicable law. Our responsibilities are described below. .We have fulfilled our ethical
responsibilities under, and are independent of the Company in accordance with, UK ethical
requirements including the FRC Ethical Standard. We believe that the audit evidence we have
obtained is a sufficient and appropriate basis for our opinion.

Going concern

The directors have prepared the financial statements on the going concern basis as they do not
intend to liquidate the Company or to cease its operations, and as they have concluded that the
Company's financial position means that this is realistic. They have also concluded that there are no
material uncertainties that could have cast significant doubt over its ability to continue as a going
concern for at least a year from the date of approval of the financial statements (“the going concern
period”). , :

In our evaluation of the directors’ conclusions, we considered the inherent risks to the Company's
business model and analysed how those risks might affect the Company’s financial resources or
ability to continue operations over the going concern period.

Our conclusions based on this work:

« we-consider that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of
the financial statements is appropriate;

ewe have not identified, and concur with the directors’ assessment that there is not, a material
uncertainty related to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant
doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for the going concern period.

However, as we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result
in outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made,
the above conclusions are not a guarantee that the Company will continue in operation.

Fraud and breaches of laws and regulations - ability to detect

To identify risks of material misstatement due to fraud (“fraud risks”) we assessed events or
conditions that could indicate an incentive or pressure to commit fraud or provide an opportunity to
commit fraud. Our risk assessment procedures included:

¢ enquiring of the directors as to the Company's high-level policies and procedures to prevent
and detect fraud as well as whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged
fraud; .

e reading Board minutes;

e using analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships.


NUTRIUS CENTRAL SERVICES LIMITED

Independent auditors’ report to the members of Nutrius Central
Services Limited (continued)

Fraud and breaches of laws and regulations — ability to detect (continued)

We communicated identified fraud risks throughout the audit team and remained alert to any
indications of fraud throughout the audit.’

As required by auditing standards, we perform procedures to address the risk of management
override of controls. On this audit we rebutted the presumed risk of fraudulent revenue recognition
due to the routine nature of revenue transactions and non-complex revenue recognition criteria.

We did not identify any additional fraud risks. We performed procedures including:

e Identifying journal entries to test based on risk criteria and comparing the identified entries to
supporting documentation.

Identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement related to compliance with laws and
regulations

We identified areas of laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a material
effect on the financial statements from our general commercial and sector experience, and through
discussion with the directors and other management (as required by auditing standards), and
discussed with the directors and other management the policies and procedures regarding
compliance with laws and regulations.

We communicated identified laws and regulations throughout our team and remained alert to any
indications of non-compliance throughout the audit.

The potential effect of these laws and regulations on the financial statements varies considerably.

Firstly, the Company is subject to laws and regulations that directly affect the financial statements
including financial reporting legislation (including related companies legislation), distributable profits
legislation and taxation legislation and we assessed the extent of compliance with these laws and
regulations as part of our procedures on the related financial statement items.

Secondly, the Company is subject to many other laws and regulations where the consequences of
non-compliance could have a material effect on amounts or disclosures in the financial statements,
for instance through the imposition of fines or litigation or the need to include significant provisions.
We identified no such indirect laws on this audit. -

Context of the ability of the audit to detect fraud or breaches of law or regulation

Owing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk that we may not have
detected some material misstatements in the financial statements, even though we have properly
planned and performed our audit in accordance with auditing standards. For example, the further
removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in
the financial statements, the less likely the inherently limited procedures required by auditing
standards would identify it.


NUTRIUS CENTRAL SERVICES LIMITED

Independent auditors’ report to the members of Nutrius Central
Services Limited (continued)

Fraud and breaches of laws and regulations — ability to detect (continued)
Context of the ability of the audit to detect fraud or breaches of law or regulation (continued)

In addition, as with any audit, there remained a higher risk of non-detection of fraud, as these may
involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal
controls. Our audit procedures are designed to detect material misstatement. We are not responsible
for preventing non-compliance or fraud and cannot be expected to detect non-compliance with alt
laws and regulations.

Strategic report and directors’ report

The directors are responsible for the strategic report and the directors’ report. Our opinion on the
financial statements does not cover those reports and we do not express an audit opinion thereon.

Our responsibility is to read the strategic report and the directors’ report and, in doing so, consider
whether, based on our financial statements audit work, the information therein is materially misstated
or inconsistent with the financial statements or our audit knowledge. Based solely on that work:

. we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report and the directors’ report;

. in our opinion the information given in those reports for the financial year is consistent with the
financial statements; and

° in our opinion those reports have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.

Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:

e adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been
received from branches not visited by us; or

¢ — the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or

e certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or

* we have not received ail the information and explanations we require for our audit. We have
nothing to report in these respects.

Directors’ responsibilities

As explained more fully in their statement set out on page 5, the directors are responsible for: the
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, such
internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; assessing the company’s ability
to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and using
the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the company or to cease
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditor's responsibilities

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue our opinion in an
auditor's report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but does not guarantee that an
audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it
exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on
the basis of the financial statements.

Independent auditors’ report to the members of Nutrius Central
Services Limited (continued)

Auditor’s responsibilities (continued)

A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC’s website at
www. frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.

The purpose of our audit work and to whom we owe our responsibilities

This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part
16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the
company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no
other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to
anyone other than the company and the company's members, as a body, for our audit work, for this
report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Notes to the financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2023

Accounting policies
General Information

Nutrius Central Services Limited is a private company limited by shares and is incorporated in the
United Kingdom (England and Wales). The address of its registered office is Malvern View, Saxon
Business Park, Hanbury Road, Stoke Prior, Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, B60 4AD.

Accounting convention and basis of presentation

The financial statements have been drawn up on a going concern basis under the historical cost
convention, and in compliance with United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including Financial
Reporting Standard 102 and the Companies Act 2006.

The financial statements have been prepared to 31 December 2023, which is within 7 days of the
accounting reference date.

The directors have conducted a review of the Company's accounting policies and have confirmed
that they are the most appropriate for the purposes of giving a true and fair view of the Company's
results and have been consistently applied.

Going Concern

The company is a member of the Nutrius UK BIDCO Group and is a party to the financing
arrangements of the wider Group. Hence the Directors have assessed the future funding
requirements of the Company through the consideration of financial forecasts for the Group for at
least 12 months from the date of signing these financial statements. Taking into account the current
and anticipated financial performance of the Group and Company the forecasts include an
assessment of the impact of severe but plausible downsides on the future trading performance of
the group.

The Group manages its liquidity needs through a combination of working capital (including cash
balances) and long term senior debt facilities, the latter of which includes certain quarterly covenant
tests. The company is subject to cross party guarantees for bank debt due by the Group (see Note
18). The long term senior debt facilities are due to mature in April 2025 and October 2025 and the
Group has secured new debt facilities to refinance these existing facilities.

The Group monitors its debt servicing requirements through the daily and weekly assessment of
the business performance including cashflows. Forecasts have been assessed against current and
future debt servicing payments and quarterly covenant tests.

The forecasts indicate that the Group and therefore the Company has sufficient facilities and
covenant headroom to meet is liabilities as they fall due for at least 12 months from the date of the
financial statements even in the severe but plausible scenario. On this basis the Directors consider
it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing these financial statements.

Consolidation exemption

The financial statements contain information about Nutrius Central Services Limited as an individual
company and do not contain consolidated financial information as the parent of a group. The
Company is exempt under section 400 of the Companies Act 2006 from the requirement to prepare
consolidated financial statements as it and its subsidiary undertakings are included by full
consolidation in the consolidated financial statements of its immediate parent, Nutrius UK BIDCO
Limited, a company registered in England and Wales. Registered address is disclosed in note 19.

NUTRIUS CENTRAL SERVICES LIMITED

Notes to the financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2023 (continued)

Accounting policies (continued)

Cashflow statement

The immediate parent undertaking, Nutrius UK BIDCO Limited, has included a cash flow statement
in its financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023. Under the exemptions conferred
by paragraph 1.12(b) of Financial Reporting Standard 102, no cash flow statement is therefore
required in the financial statements of this company.

Turnover

Turnover represents royalty charges made to subsidiary companies for use of intellectual property,
policies and procedures and is recognised over the period utilised, 2023: £4.4m (2022: £4.2m).

Patents and trademarks

Patents and trademarks are stated at historic purchase cost less accumulated amortisation. The
cost of patents and trademarks is their purchase cost, together with any incidental costs of
acquisition. .

Amortisation of patents and trademarks is calculated at annual rates estimated to write off the cost
of each asset, less its residual value, on a straight line basis over the term of its estimated useful
life, which the directors estimate to be 20 years.

Impairment reviews are performed by the directors when there has been an indication of potential
impairment.

Software

Software is stated at historic cost less accumulated amortisation. The cost of software is their
purchase cost, together with any incidental costs of acquisition

Amortisation of software is calculated at annual rates estimated to write off the cost of each asset,
less its estimated residual value, over the term of its estimated useful life. The rates adopted for
Software is straight line over 4 years.

Amortisation of software licenses is calculated at annual rates estimated to write off the cost of each
asset, less its estimated residual value, over the term of its estimated useful life. The rates adopted
for Software licenses is straight line over 3 years.

Assets under course of construction are not being amortised.

Tangible fixed assets and depreciation

Unless otherwise stated tangible fixed assets are stated at historic purchase cost less accumulated
depreciation. The cost of tangible fixed assets is their purchase cost, together with any incidental
costs of acquisition.

Tangible assets are derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected.
On disposal, the difference between the net disposal proceeds and they carrying amount is
recognised the profit or loss. .

NUTRIUS CENTRAL SERVICES LIMITED

Notes to the financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2023 (continued)

Accounting policies (continued)
Tangible fixed assets and depreciation (continued)

Depreciation

Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets over their estimated useful lives, as follows:
Asset class Depreciation method and rate
Fixtures and fittings - 25% straight line

Freehold Property - 2% straight line

Hire purchase and operating leases

Where the Group enters into a lease which entails taking substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership of an asset, the lease is treated as a “finance lease’. The asset is recorded in the balance
sheet as a tangible fixed asset and is depreciated over its estimated useful life or the term of the tease,
whichever is shorter. Future instalments under such leases, net of finance charges, are included within
creditors. Rentals payable are apportioned between the finance element, which is charged to the profit
and loss account, and the capital element which reduces the outstanding obligation for future
instalments. :

Costs in respect of operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis
over the lease term. .

Incentives received to enter into an operating lease are credited to the profit and loss account, to
reduce the lease expense, on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.

The group has taken advantage of the exemption in respect of lease incentives on leases in
existence at the transition date to FRS 102 (1st January 2014) and continues to credit such lease
incentives to the profit and loss account over the period to first review date on which the rent is
adjusted to market rates.

Investments

Investments in subsidiary undertakings are recorded at costs plus incidental expenses less any
provision for impairment. Impairment reviews are performed by the directors when there has been an
indication of potential impairment.

Taxation

Current Tax

Current tax is the amount of income tax payable in respect of the taxable profit for the year and prior
years. Tax is calculated on the basis of tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively
enacted at the period end.

Accounting policies (continued)
Taxation (continued)
Deferred tax

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at
the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the

- future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date. Timing
differences are temporary differences between profits as computed for tax purposes and profits as
stated in the financial statements, which arise because certain items of income and expenditure in the
financial statements are dealt with in different years for tax purposes.

Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the years in which the
timing differences are expected to reverse based on tax rates that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.. Deferred tax is not discounted.

Deferred tax assets are only recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be
suitable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.

Tax on profit (continued)
(b) Factors affecting the tax charge —

The tax assessed on the profit for the year is higher (2022: higher) than the standard rate of corporation
in the UK of 23.5% (2022: 19%)

The differences are explained below:

2023 2022
£'000 £000
Profit before taxation 14,114 13,278
Profit multiplied by the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 23.5% 3,317 2,523
(2022: 19%)
Effects of:
Expenses disallowable for taxation purposes 218 99
Transfer pricing adjustment (96) (58)
Adjustments in respect of prior periods (4) (13)
Tax rate changes (7) (13)
Total tax charge for the year , 3,428 2,538

A change to the UK corporation tax rate was substantively enacted as part of Finance Bill 2021 in May
2021 and from 1 April 2023, the headline rate of corporation tax has increased from 19% to 25%. The
main rate of 25% is applicable to companies with augmented profits over £250,000 whilst for small
businesses (with augmented profits under £50,000) remains at 19%. For augmented profits that fall
between the two thresholds, a marginal relief for businesses has been introduced so that they pay
less than the main rate. The upper and lower augmented profits limits are apportioned according to
the number of companies which are associated for corporation tax purposes and also apportioned for
short accounting periods.

The deferred tax assets and liabilities in these financial statements have been calculated based on

these assets and liabilities reversing at 25% (2022:25%) as this rate has been enacted at the balance
sheet date.
