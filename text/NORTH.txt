Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities

The directors acknowledge their responsibilities for preparing the Directors’ Report and the financial statements
in accordance with applicable law and regulations.

Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the
directors have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company law the
directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of
the state of affairs of the company and of the profit or loss of the company for that period. In preparing these
financial statements, the directors are required to:

* select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently;
* make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;

* prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the
company will continue in business.

The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the
company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company
and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

Independent Auditor's Report to the Members of North Wales Training Ltd.

Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of North Wales Training Ltd. (the ‘company’ for the year ended 31 July
2024, which comprise the Profit and Loss Account and Statement of Retained Earnings, Balance Sheet, and Notes
to the Financial Statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. The financial reporting
framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards,
including FRS 102 'The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland' (United
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

In our opinion the financial statements:

* give a true and fair view of the state of the company's affairs as at 31 July 2024 and of its profit for the year
then ended;

+ have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice;
and

* have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable
law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the auditor responsibilities for the audit of
the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the company in accordance with the ethical
requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical
Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We
believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Conclusions relating to going concern

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the director's use of the going concern basis of
accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or
conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a
going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the original financial statements were authorised
for issue.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the
relevant sections of this report.

Other information

The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements
and our auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and,
except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion
thereon.

Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is
materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears
to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are
required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a
material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.

Independent Auditor's Report to the Members of North Wales Training Ltd.

Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

* the information given in the Directors' Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are
prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and

* the Directors' Report has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of our knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the course of
the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the Directors' Report.

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to

report to you if, in our opinion:

* adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received
from branches not visited by us; or

* the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
* certain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or
+ we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or

+ the directors were not entitled to prepare the financial statements in accordance with the small companies’ regime and
take advantage of the small companies’ exemption to prepare a strategic report.

Responsibilities of directors

As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors' Responsibilities set out on page 3, the directors are
responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair
view, and for such intemal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the company's ability to continue
as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis
of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic
alternative but to do so.

Auditor Responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance
with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or
error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

The extent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including

fraud

Irregularities are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. The objectives of our audit are to obtain
sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding compliance with laws and regulations that have a direct effect on the
determination of material amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, to perform audit procedures to help
identify instances of non-compliance with other laws and regulations that may have a material effect on the financial
statements, and to respond appropriately to identified or suspected non-compliance with laws and regulations
identified during the audit.

In relation to fraud, the objectives of our audit are to identify and assess the risk of material misstatement of the
financial statements due to fraud, to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the assessed risks of
material misstatement due to fraud through designing and implementing appropriate responses and to respond
appropriately to fraud or suspected fraud identified during the audit.

Independent Auditor's Report to the Members of North Wales Training Ltd.

However, it is the primary responsibility of management, with the oversight of those charged with governance, to
ensure that the entity’s operations are conducted in accordance with the provisions of laws and regulations and for
the prevention and detection of fraud.

In identifying and assessing risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including fraud, the audit
engagement team: :

obtained an understanding of the nature of the industry and sector, including the legal and regulatory
framework that the company operates in and how the company is complying with the legal and regulatory
framework;

inquired of management, and those charged with governance, about their own identification and assessment
of the risks of irregularities, including any known actual, suspected or alleged instances of fraud;

¢ discussed matters about non-compliance with laws and regulations and how fraud might occur including
assessment of how and where the financial statements may be susceptible to fraud.

As a result of these procedures we consider the most significant laws and regulations that have a direct impact on
the financial statements are FRS 102 and the Companies Act 2006. We performed audit procedures to detect non-
compliances which may have a material impact on the financial statements which included reviewing financial
statement disclosures.

The audit engagement team identified the risk of management override of controls as the area where the financial
statements were most susceptible to material misstatement due to fraud. Audit procedures performed included but
were not limited to testing manual journal entries and other adjustments and evaluating the business rationale in
relation to significant, unusual transactions and transactions entered into outside the normal course of business.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial
Reporting Council’s website at: http://www. frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities This description forms part of our
auditor’s report.

Use of our report

This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted
by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members
as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Page 9

North Wales Training Ltd.
Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 July 2024

The company recognises revenue when:

The amount of revenue can be reliably measured;
it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity;
and specific criteria have been met for each of the company's activities.

Government grants

Government grants in respect of capital expenditure are credited to the profit and loss account over the estimated
useful life of the relevant fixed assets. The grants shown in the balance sheet represent the total grants receivable
to date less the amount so far credited to the profit and loss account.

Grants relating to revenue shall be recognised in income on a systematic basis over the periods in which the entity
recognises the related costs for which the grant is intended to compensate.

Tax .

The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of tax rates and laws that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the reporting date in the countries where the company operates and generates taxable
income.

Donation of profits
The accounting profits of the company will be paid to the parent charity within nine months of the reporting date
and as such there is no taxable profit.

Tangible assets
Tangible assets are initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost or valuation, net of depreciation
and any impairment losses.

The cost of tangible assets includes directly attributable incremental costs incurred in their acquisition and
installation.

Depreciation
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than land and properties under construction
over their estimated useful lives, as follows:

Asset class , Depreciation method and rate
Freehold Land and buildings 2% on cost

Leasehold Improvements 10% on cost (or over length of lease)
Plant and machinery 33% on cost

Share capital

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Equity instruments are measured at the fair value of the cash or other
resources received or receivable, net of the direct costs of issuing the equity instruments. If payment is deferred
and the time value of money is material, the initial measurement is on a present value basis.

Dividends
Dividend distribution to the company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the
reporting period in which the dividends are declared.

Defined contribution pension obligation

A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which fixed contributions are paid into a pension fund and the
company has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions even if the fund does not hold
sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.

Contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as employee benéfit expense when they are due. If
contribution payments exceed the contribution due for service, the excess is recognised as a prepayment.
