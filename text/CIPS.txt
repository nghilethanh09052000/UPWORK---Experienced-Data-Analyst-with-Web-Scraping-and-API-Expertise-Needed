Directors’ report

The directors present the audited accounts for the year ended 31st October 2024.

The directors have taken the small companies exemption contained in $414B of the Companies Act
2006 from the requirement to prepare a Strategic Report.

CIPS Corporate Services Limited is a private company incorporated in the United Kingdom and
registered in England and Wales under the Companies Act 2006, and limited by shares.

Principal activities and review of the business

The company provides training services and trades in books on behalf of the Chartered Institute of
Procurement and Supply. The directors consider the results for the year and the year-end financial
position to be satisfactory.

Results
Details of the results for the year are shown in the statement of comprehensive income on page 9.

Turnover for the year has increased by 15% to £1,350,177 (2023: £1,174,250) driven by continued
growth in Bookshop sales, and ongoing recovery from declining revenues in prior years.

The profit for the year increased by 17% to £1,016,496 (2023: £865,005) driven by the increase in
revenue and the reduction in the overall level of stock provisions for obsolete stock.

Going concern

These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. In undertaking a going
concern review, the directors have considered the period to 30 April 2026 and are of view that the
company has adequate resources to continue in business for the foreseeable future. Economic
uncertainties affecting the UK during the year, including economic pressures arising from the cost of
living, alongside wider geo-political uncertainties are not expected to directly impact the company’s
activities.

This consideration has been made alongside the forecasting undertaken by the larger group, and takes
into account expected future activity around examinations and training delivery, since this tends to
directly correlate to e-learning and bookshop sales.

Statement of directors’ responsibilities

The directors are responsible for preparing the Directors’ report and the financial statements in
accordance with applicable law and regulations.

Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that
law the directors have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards) and applicable law,
including FRS 102 ‘The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland’. Under
company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs and profit or loss of the company for that period. In
preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:

e select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;

e make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;

© prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to
presume that the company will continue in business.

The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and
explain the company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial
position of the company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the
Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and hence
for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

The directors confirm that:

© so far as each director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the company’s
auditor is unaware; and

e the directors have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as directors in order to
make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the company’s
auditor is aware of that information.

Independent auditor’s report to the
members of CIPS Corporate Services Limited

Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of CIPS Corporate Services Limited (the 'company’) for the
year ended 31 October 2024, which comprise the statement of comprehensive income, the statement
of changes in equity, the statement of financial position and notes to the financial statements,
including a summary of significant accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that has
been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards,
including Financial Reporting Standard 102 ‘The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and
Republic of Ireland’ (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

In our opinion:

e the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the company's affairs as at 31
October 2024 and of its profit for the year then ended;

e the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and

e the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the
Companies Act 2006.

Basis for opinion ;

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and
applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the ‘Auditor's
responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements’ section of our report. We are independent of
the company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial
statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Conclusions relating to going concern

We are responsible for concluding on the appropriateness of the directors’ use of the going concern
basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists
related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as
a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention
in our report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are
inadequate, to modify the auditor’s opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained
up to the date of our report. However, future events or conditions may cause the company to cease
to continue as a going concern.

In our evaluation of the directors’ conclusions, we considered the inherent risks associated with the
company's business model including effects arising from macro-economic uncertainties such as
current rates of inflation and cost of living, we assessed and challenged the reasonableness of
estimates made by the directors and the related disclosures and analysed how those risks might affect
the company's financial resources or ability to continue operations over the going concern period.

Docusign Envelope iD: 4BFB08B1-3E58-4AA6-9403-8FE4582818B6

CIPS Corporate Services Limited
Company number 02610367

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern
basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to
events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the company's
ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial
statements are authorised for issue.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are
described in the relevant sections of this report.

Other information

The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the
financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other
information contained within the annual report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not
cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do
not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other
information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the
audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or
apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material
misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we
conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report
that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.

Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

e the information given in the directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and

e the directors’ report has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

Matter on which we are required to report under the Companies Act 2006
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the
course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the directors’ report.

Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act
2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:

e adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been
received from branches not visited by us; or

e the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
¢ certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or

e we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or

Docusign Envelope ID: 48FB08B1-3E58-4AA6-9403-8FE4582818B6

CIPS Corporate Services Limited
Company number 02610367

e the directors were not entitled to prepare the financial statements in accordance with the small
companies regime and take advantage of the small companies’ exemptions from the requirement
to prepare a strategic report.

Responsibilities of directors

As explained more fully in the statement of directors' responsibilities set out on page 3, the directors
are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a.
true and fair view, and for such internal contro! as the directors determine is necessary to enable the
preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud
or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the company's ability
to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using
the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the company or
to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report
that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee
that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when
it exists.

Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on *
the basis of these financial statements.

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. The extent
to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below:

e We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the
company and the sector in which it operates. We determined that the following laws and
regulations were most significant: The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and the
Republic of Ireland (FRS 102), Companies Act 2006 and the Finance Act;

« We understood how the company is complying with these legal and regulatory frameworks by
making inquiries of management and those charged with governance. We enquired of
management and those charged with governance whether there were any instances of non-
compliance with laws and regulations, or whether they had any knowledge of actual or suspected
fraud. We corroborated the results of our enquiries through our review of board minutes, and
through our legal and professional expenses review;

e We assessed the susceptibility of the company’s financial statements to material misstatement,
including how fraud might occur and the risk of material override of controls. Audit procedures
performed by the engagement team included:

— Identifying and assessing the design effectiveness of certain controls management has in place
to prevent and detect fraud;

— Challenging assumptions and judgments made by management in its significant accounting
policies;

- Identifying and testing journal entries;

Docusign Envelope ID: 4BFB08B1-3E58-4AA6-9403-8F E4582818B6

CIPS Corporate Services Limited,
Company number 02610367

— Identifying and testing related party transactions;
— Inspecting the board minutes; and

— Assessing the extent of compliance with the relevant laws and regulations as part of our
procedures on the related financial statement item.

e These audit procedures were designed to provide reasonable assurance that the financial
statements were free from fraud or error. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to
fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error and detecting irregularities
that result from fraud is inherently more difficult than detecting those that result from error, as
fraud may involve collusion, deliberate concealment, forgery or intentional misrepresentations.
Also, the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is from events and
transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely we would become aware of it;

e The engagement partner’s assessment of the appropriateness of the collective competence and
capabilities of the engagement team included consideration of the engagement team’s:

— Understanding of, and practical experience with, audit engagements of a similar nature and
complexity through appropriate training and participation

— Understanding of the legal and regulatory requirements specific to the entity including the
provisions of the applicable legislation;

¢ The team communications in respect of potential non-compliance with laws and regulations and
fraud included the potential for fraud in revenue recognition through manipulation of income.
e in assessing the potential risks of material misstatement, we obtained an understanding of:

— The company’s operations, including the nature of its revenue sources, to understand the
classes of transactions, accounts balances, expected financial statement disclosures and
business risks that may result in risks of material misstatement, and

— The company’s control environment, including:

— Management's knowledge of relevant laws and regulations and how the company is complying
with those laws and regulations

— The adequacy of procedures for authorisation of transactions and review of management ,
accounts, and

— Procedures to ensure that possible breaches of laws and regulations are appropriately resolved.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the
Financial Reporting Council’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description
forms part of our auditor’s report.

Notes to the financial statements
for the year ended 31 October 2024

1. Accounting policies
a) Basis of preparation

The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom
accounting standards, including FRS 102 ‘The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the United
Kingdom and Republic of Ireland’ and with the Companies Act 2006. The financial statements have
been prepared on the historical cost basis. The presentation and functional currency is sterling (£).
The company has not presented a consolidated set of financial statements as these are included in
the parent company, The Chartered institute of Procurement and Supply own financial statements.

The company has taken advantage of the exemption under section 1A of FRS 102 from preparing a
statement of cash flows and from disclosing related party transactions with the parent company on
the basis that it is a qualifying entity. The parent company, The Chartered Institute of Procurement
and Supply includes the company’s cash flow in its own consolidated financial statements.

Going concern

These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. In undertaking a going
concern review, the directors have considered the period to 30 April 2026 and are of view that the
company has adequate resources to continue in business for the foreseeable future. Economic
uncertainties affecting the UK during the year, including economic pressures arising from the cost of
living, alongside wider geo-political uncertainties are not expected to directly impact the company’s
activities.

This consideration has been made alongside the forecasting undertaken by the larger group, and takes
into account expected future activity around examinations and training delivery, since this tends to
directly correlate to e-learning and bookshop sales.

b) Revenue
Revenue from the sale of books is recognised when the publication is shipped.

Revenue from training services is recognised on a straight-line basis over the duration of the training
course. Payments received in advance of the provision of training services are recognised as deferred
revenue in the balance sheet, and released as the training course is provided.

c) Covenant

The company has entered into an arrangement under a deed of covenant to pay annually to the
Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply the taxable profit arising from its activities.

d) Investments

Invesment in subsidiaries are shown at cost less any provision for impaired carrying value.
e) Stock ;
Stock comprises goods for resale and is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
f) Taxation

The company is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply,
which is a charity within the meaning of Paragraph 1 Schedule 6 of the Finance Act 2010. The company
makes qualifying donations of all taxable profit to its parent charity under a deed of covenant.

The company recognises a corporate tax liability in the same period as it accrues its profits; the liability

Docusign Envelope ID: 4BFB08B1-3E58-4AA6-9403-8F E4582818B6

CIPS Corporate Services Limited
Company number 02610367
is reversed on the distribution of profits to the parent charity.
g) Judgements in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty

In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates
and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and
other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from those estimates and
underlying assumptions are continually reviewed.

The following are critical judgements that the Directors have made in the process of applying the
accounting policies:

e Trade debtors: At each reporting date, trade debtors are assessed for recoverability. If there
is any evidence of impairment, the carrying amount of the debtor is reduced to its recoverable
amount. The impairment foss is recognised immediately in the statement of financial
activities.

e Deferred revenue: At each reporting date, the Directors considered the detailed criteria for
the recognition of revenue from the sales of goods set out in FRS 102 section 23, in order to
defer revenue over the life of the subscription.

2. Turnover

Turnover represents amounts receivable from customers for goods and services rendered excluding
value added tax and is attributable to one class of business.

The geographical analysis of turnover is as follows:
