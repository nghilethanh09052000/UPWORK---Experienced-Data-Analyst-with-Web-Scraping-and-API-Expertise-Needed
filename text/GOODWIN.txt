Annual Report and Financial Statements
‘ 30 April 2024

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Directors' Report and the financial statements in accordance with
applicable law and regulations.

Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law, the Directors
have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law).

Under company law, the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a
true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the company for that period.

In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are required to:

e select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;

« make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;

e state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed
and explained in the financial statements; -

® prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company
will continue in business.

The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and
enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for
safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud
and other irregularities.

Independent Auditor's Report to the members of Goodwin Engineering Training
Company Limited

Opinion :

We have audited the financial statements of Goodwin Engineering Training Company Limited (the ‘Company’) for the

year ended 30 April 2024 which comprise the profit and loss account, the balance sheet, the statement of changes in

equity and notes to the financial statements, including significant accounting policies. The financial reporting framework

that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 101

“Reduced Disclosure Framework” (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

In our opinion, the financial statements:

e give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 30 April 2024 and of its profit for the year then
ended;

* have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice;

* have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

Basis for opinion _

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial
statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that
are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled
our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Conclusions relating to going concern

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting
in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions
that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a
period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the Directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant
sections of this report.

Other information

The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and
our auditor’s report thereon. The Directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise
explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is is materially
inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit or otherwise appears to
be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required
to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the
work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required
to report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.

Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

* the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared
is consistent with the financial statements; and

e the Directors' Report has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

Independent Auditor's Report to the members of Goodwin Engineering Training
Company Limited (continued)

Matters on which we are required to report by exception

In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit,
we have not identified material misstatements in the Directors‘ Report.

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us
to report to you if, in our opinion:

¢ adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from
branches not visited by us; or

the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or

certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or

we have not received ail the information and explanations we require for our audit; or

the Directors were not entitled to take advantage of the small companies exemption from the requirement to
prepare a strategic report.

Responsibilities of Directors

As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set out on page 2, the Directors are responsible
for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such
internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a
going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting
unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to
do so.

Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs
(UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic
decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

The extent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud

Irregularities are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. The objectives of our audit are to obtain

sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding compliance with laws and regulations that have a direct effect on the

determination of material amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, to perform audit procedures to help

identify instances of non-compliance with other laws and regulations that may have a material effect on the financial

statements, and to respond appropriately to identified or suspected non-compliance with laws and regulations identified

during the audit.

in relation to fraud, the objectives of our audit are to identify and assess the risk of material misstatement of the financial

statements due to fraud, to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the assessed risks of material

misstatement due to fraud through designing and implementing appropriate responses and to respond appropriately to

fraud or suspected fraud identified during the audit.

However, it is the primary responsibility of management, with the oversight of those charged with governance, to ensure

that the entity's operations are conducted in accordance with the provisions of laws and regulations and for the

prevention and detection of fraud.

In identifying and assessing risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including fraud, the audit

engagement team:

e@ obtained an understanding of the nature of the industry and sector, including the legal and regulatory framework
that the Company operates in and how the Company is complying with the legal and regulatory framework;

e inquired of management, and those charged with governance, about their own identification and assessment of the
risks of irregularities, including any known actual, suspected or alleged instances of fraud;

e discussed matters about non-compliance with laws and regulations and how fraud might occur including assessment
of how and where the financial statements may be susceptible to fraud.

As a result of these procedures we consider the most significant laws and regulations that have a direct impact on the

financial statements are FRS 101, the Companies Act 2006 and tax compliance regulations. We performed audit

Independent Auditor's Report to the members of Goodwin Engineering Training
Company Limited (continued)

procedures to detect non-compliances which may have a material impact on the financial statements which included
reviewing financial statement disclosures and review of any correspondence in the year with tax authorities.

The audit engagement team identified the risk of management override of controls as the area where the financial
statements were most susceptible to material misstatement due to fraud. Audit procedures performed included but
were not limited to testing manual journal entries and other adjustments and evaluating the business rationale in relation
to significant, unusual transactions and transactions entered into outside the normal course of business.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting
Council’s website at: http://www. frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.

Use of our report

This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted
by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a
body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Notes to the financial statements

1. Significant accounting policies

a) General information
Goodwin Engineering Training Company Limited (the “Company”) is a private company, limited by shares,
incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales.

b) Basis of preparation
These unabbreviated financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis, except where the measurement
of balances is required at fair value. Numbers are rounded to the nearest £1.
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101, "Reduced
Disclosure Framework" (FRS 101) and in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
The Company’s ultimate parent undertaking, Goodwin PLC, includes the Company in its consolidated financial
statements. The consolidated financial statements of Goodwin PLC are prepared in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards and are available to the public and may be obtained from the Company’s website:
www.goodwin.co.uk and from the Company’s Registered Office: Ivy House Foundry, Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent, ST1
3NR.
Reporting exemptions
In these financial statements, the Company has applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the
following disclosures:
« the requirement in paragraph 38 of IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements to present comparative period
reconciliations for tangible fixed assets;
e the requirements of paragraphs 134 to 136 of IAS | Presentation of Financial Statements in respect of capital
management;
e the requirements of IAS 7 to present a Cash Flow Statement and related notes;
® the requirements of paragraphs 30 and 31 of IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and
Errors in respect of the effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs;
e the requirements of paragraph 17 and 18a of IAS 24, Related Party Transactions in respect of the compensation
of Key Management Personnel; and
« the requirements in IAS 24 Related Party Transactions to disclose related party transactions between two
members of the Goodwin PLC group, provided that any subsidiary, which is a party to the transactions, is wholly
owned.
As the consolidated financial statements of Goodwin PLC include the equivalent disclosures, the Company has also
taken the exemptions under FRS 101 available in respect of
e the requirements of IFRS 7 Financial Instrument: Disclosures; and
e the requirements of paragraphs 91 to 99 of IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.

The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods
presented in these financial statements.

¢) Going concern

The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which the Directors consider to be
appropriate for the following reasons. :

The Company participates in the Group’s centralised treasury arrangements and so is able to call upon the treasury
facilities.

The Directors have prepared cash flow forecasts for a period of twelve months from the date of approval of these
financial statements which indicate that, taking account of reasonably possible downsides, the Company will have
sufficient funds, initially through funding from Goodwin PLC subsidiary companies, and if required, through Goodwin
PLC, to meet its liabilities as they fall due for that period.

Goodwin Engineering Training Company Limited
Annual Report and Financial Statements
30 April 2024

Notes to the financial statements (continued)

1 __ Significant accounting policies (continued)

The Directors of Goodwin PLC have indicated their intention to continue to make available such funds as are needed
by the Company for the period covered by the forecasts. As with any company placing reliance on other group
entities for financial support, the Directors acknowledge that there can be no certainty that this support will
continue although, at the date of approval of these financial statements, they have no reason to believe that it will
not do so.

Consequently, the Directors are confident that the Company will have sufficient funds to continue to meet its
liabilities as they fall due for at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements and
therefore have prepared the financial statements on a going concern basis.

d) Turnover
Turnover comprises income from the government training levy when the relevant apprentice training milestones
have been achieved and charges to Goodwin PLC group subsidiary companies for training services provided.

e) Pension costs

The Company contributes to a defined contribution pension scheme for employees under an Auto Enrolment
Pension arrangement, as required by Government legislation. The assets of the scheme are held in independently
administered funds. Company pension costs are charged to the profit and loss account in the year for which
contributions are payable.

Contributions to the schemes are made on a monthly basis.

f} Taxation

Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the profit and loss
account except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in
equity.

Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively
enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.

Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for
financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The amount of deferred tax provided is
based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax
rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available
against which the asset can be utilised.

g) Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation is charged to the profit and loss account over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of
tangible fixed assets. Depreciation rates are as follows:

Asset class Depreciation method Useful economic lives

Other equipment Straight line or reducing balance 4 years

h) Non-derivative financial instruments

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Company’s balance sheet when the Company has
become a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. The principal financial assets and liabilities of the
Company are as follows:

Other debtors

After being recognised initially at fair value, other debtors are measured, subsequently, at amortised cost. The
carrying amount of other debtors is considered to be a reasonable approximation of their fair value.

10

Goodwin Engineering Training Company Limited
Annual Report and Financial Statements
30 April 2024

Notes to the financial statements (continued)

1 Significant accounting policies (continued)
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables (including intercompany balances) are recognised initially at fair value, and are
subsequently reported at amortised cost.
Recognition and valuation of equity instruments
Equity instruments are stated at par value, with the par value of ordinary shares being reported as share capital.

i} Impairment

The carrying amounts of the Company’s assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there
is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. The
recoverable amount is the greater of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell or value in use.

An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the profit and loss account.

Reversals of impairment

In respect of assets other than goodwill, an impairment loss is reversed when there is an indication that the
impairment loss may no longer exist and there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the
recoverable amount.

An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying
amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been
recognised.

2. Turnover

Turnover comprises income received from the government training levy when the relevant apprentice training
milestones have been achieved and charges to Goodwin PLC Group subsidiary companies for training services
provided. Turnover is generated entirely in the UK.

3. Expenses and auditor's remuneration
Included in Profit before taxation are the following expenses:
