Trustees’ report
Year ended 31 July 2024

The trustees, who act as directors for the purposes of company law, are pleased to present their annual report
together with the financial statements for the year ended 31 July 2024.

The annual report serves the purposes of both a trustees’ report and a directors’ report under company law. The
trustees confirm that the annual report and financial statements of the charitable company comply with the
current statutory requirements, the requirements of the charitable company's governing document and the
provisions of the Statement of Recommended Practice (SORP) applicable to charities preparing their accounts
in accordance with the Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland (FRS102)
(effective 1 January 2019).

Since the charity qualifies as small under section 382 of the Companies Act 2006, the strategic report required of
medium and large companies under the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors' Report)
Regulations 2013 has been omitted.

OBJECTIVES AND ACTIVITIES
The charity's objectives are specific towards the advancement of learning and education for the public benefit of
persons employed or intending to be employed in industry and commerce.

Core Business Objectives
. Maintain apprenticeship recruitment levels and the number of new employers;

. Maintain or improve overall apprenticeship completion rates;

. Achieve a financial operational surplus; and

. Continually enhance the quality of learning delivery.

Our overall aim is to deliver a high-quality service to an increasing number of apprentices and employers within
the region by increasing the skills, knowledge and understanding of those involved in engineering and business-
related activities.

Contracts with the Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) and employers provide the funding to deliver
accredited advanced apprenticeship standards benefiting young people, the majority whom begin their
apprenticeships between the ages of 16-18 years old. The total number of apprentices on-programme during
2023 — 2024 was 344 (2022 — 2023: 396).

The policy of the trustees is to utilise the charity reserves in supporting business growth and manage risk with
any additional surpluses used to enhance the skills and learning of existing apprentices, support employer
engagement; design and implement business model changes in response to ESFA funding rule changes and be
available as contingency funding in the event of apprentices being made redundant and/or the loss of
government funded contracts.

The charity's main activities are to:

. Continue to align business operations to ESFA funding rules and regulation;
Maximise the availability of high-quality apprenticeship candidates for potential employers;
. Deliver high quality, sustainable engineering manufacturing and business administration apprenticeships.
. Drive and sustain employer engagement and business development activities;
. Finance, plan, resource, implement, and manage business change projects in response to market
opportunities and to mitigate charity risk; and
* . Inthe event of any apprentice being made redundant, support and identify alternative employment

opportunities for the continuation of their apprenticeship.

Funding levels along with the operation and main activities are reviewed on an annual basis by the trustees.
Grant making is not a material part of the charity's activities.

Trustees’ report (continued)
Year ended 31 July 2024

Public Benefit

The charitable company offers a wide range of advanced apprenticeships and functional skills to relevant
apprentices within the local engineering manufacturing and business sectors. We are very committed to
delivering a high standard of quality that will ensure all users of our service are completely satisfied and have the
opportunity to make appropriate comments.

We assist companies to understand and comply with current apprenticeship standards, the contractual
arrangements and the apprenticeship levy system. We also support young people in making appropriate
apprenticeship decisions, many from disadvantaged backgrounds, guiding them with information and advice to
achieve their full potential successfully, progressing them through a level 3 apprenticeship and also providing
encouragement and further support onto higher education courses. Should any apprentice be facing the
prospect of a possible redundancy, we will continue to offer support and ensure the smooth transition from one
employer to another.

ACHIEVEMENTS AND PERFORMANCE

Achievements
Achievements of the charity are assessed internally and externally, both qualitatively and quantifiably through:

Internal assessment

This is performed through a review against company operating policies and procedures within our Quality
Assurance (QA) system that is continually updated along with yearly performance management against business
objectives.

External assessments:

These are performed by Ofsted who assess our apprenticeship delivery against the (EIF) Education Inspection
Framework where we continually maintain our Ofsted ‘Good’ inspection status, demonstrating high standards
and service delivery. Overall Leadership and Management were highlighted as strengths. We are preparing for
the possibility of another inspection during 2025.

Financial Assurance Teams from the ESFA audit our performance against the contractual funding requirements
and performance management against contractual obligations and national quality measures. We achieved our
core apprenticeship completion objective by matching the low target set for unsuccessful apprenticeship
completions specific to both engineering and business administration. The overall qualification achievement rate
(QAR) for apprenticeships was 76.8% (2023: 70.3%). This is an improvement on the previous year’s results for
those apprentices, whose progression was impacted and delayed with COVID, successfully completing their
apprenticeships. This continued into the early part of 2023/24 but all delayed apprenticeships had been
completed by the end of July 2024. We did not achieve our core objective for apprenticeship recruitment targets
which was mainly due to a fall in the number of suitable candidates applying for an apprenticeship combined with
lower-than-expected employer demand for new apprentices.

Strategic Objectives

Our first strategic objective were to recruit and train human resources to meet our functional and business
requirements, this being achieved by supporting our Training Officers. Our second objective was to minimise
external risks and to ensure high levels of compliance through enhanced process standardisation. To achieve
this, we introduced an operational audit process to ensure compliance with the ESFA funding rules.

The ESFA subcontractor rules prohibits any more than 25% of a main providers apprenticeship funding being
subcontracted. This requires us to secure and maintain its ‘Contractor Cap Exemption’ status which was
approved for the current year, with an application made and successfully granted for the 2024/25 year.
Exemption for 2025/26 will be applied for at the appropriate time.

Staff Matters

Stable staff levels have promoted a good work ethic to complete all the required procedures by keeping sufficient
and appropriate records allowing the company to maintain its high standards. Subsequent to the year end, the

Year ended 31 July 2024

former Chief Executive Officer (CEO) left the charity with effect from 30 September 2024. The chair of the board
has temporarily taken on the role of the CEO while a long term solution is found.

External Factors Impacting Achievement

The main external factors effecting the achievement of business objectives during 2023 - 2024 were:

. The continuing workload of staff for those learners that were due for completion in 2023/24 backed up
from those learners with previous years overdue completion dates who were impacted by the coronavirus
pandemic — the delayed learners were completed by the end of the financial year;

. Timely completion of subcontracted delivery of qualifications enabling learners to proceed to End Point
Assessment; and
. The embedding of the new level 3 Machining Technician Standard with extensive work undertaken by

relevant staff to develop an appropriate deliverable programme.

FINANCIAL REVIEW

Investment Policy

In a constant changing world. the investment policy of the trustees remains one of caution. With continuing cost
tises, close monitoring is required to ensure it achieves the best return. Our initial deposit with two investment
managers has result in a small profit. During the year, the funds were withdrawn from one investment manager
bringing the total investments at year end to £357,580 (2023: £635,363).

Financial Performance

Income has remained largely consistent at £1,697,236 (2023: £1,697,366), the key movements being a reduction
in learners that has resulted in less funding from the ESFA, offset by an increase in funding per apprentice and
Investment income increasing due to favourable market conditions. The charitable activities expenditure has
decreased significantly to £1,698,372 (2023: £2,064,983) due to 2023 including a significant accrual for the
former CEO's settlement agreement. The year end result was a deficit of £18,841 (2023: deficit of £374,196) on
unrestricted funds, including a gain on investments. Given some of the challenging circumstances during the
period described above the trustees are satisfied with the year end position.

Reserves Policy
The level of unrestricted reserves at 31 July 2024 was £1,058,063. These are held for important reasons:

1. Fund necessary activities to minimise risk to the charities ability to operate as a going concern.

2. Enable the charity to discharge all its commitments to existing apprentices and companies should
government funding diminish or cease;

3. Fund business development and growth to remain competitive and to offer the charities services to a
wider business community; and

4. Support apprentices made redundant to continue and complete their apprenticeships with alternative
Employers.

A designated capital fund of £340,796 was held at 31 July 2024 which is equal to the net book value of the
property. The free reserves held at 31 July 2024 were £717,267.

Principle Funding Sources
Principle funding sources and associated activities during 2023-24

. ESFA - 100% government funding up to the apprenticeship standard funding cap for 16-18 apprentices to
cover training costs when employed within a small company employing less than 50 employees with a
payroll of less than £3 million, however there is a 5% employer funding contribution should they recruit a
19+ apprentice; 95% funding from the ESFA and 5% funding cost for an employer recruiting an apprentice
who employs more than 50 employees but has a payroll of less than £3 million;

. Employers - Large companies who employ more than 50 employees with a payroll in excess of £3 million
fund Tyne North Training apprenticeships direct through their employer levy accounts.

. Commercial income - investment income and interest — a small proportion of income is generated
through the delivery of NVQs to existing adult employees working within apprenticeship employing
companies.

Trustees’ report (continued)
Year ended 31 July 2024

. Investments - These are held by an investment manager aiming to bring short term funding through
interest and dividend income and long term funding through capital growth and interest received on those
reserves held.

Going Concern

Whilst the charity has gone through a period of change at management level, the board have prepared and
reviewed forecasts for the coming periods based upon expected apprenticeship take up rates and known funding
sources. With robust systems in place to ensure ongoing high quality delivery of work and taking into account
the significant reserves held, the trustees are satisfied that the going concern basis of preparation remains
appropriate for these financial statements.

PLANS FOR FUTURE PERIODS

The company will continue to effectively manage external changes and challenging targets contained within the
core objectives agreed each year, to effectively capitalise on future growth opportunities and enhance quality
delivery.

The charity will continue to focus on achieving its core objectives to:

. Ensure we continue to meet ESFA contractual obligations and maintain both EAL and Pearson
assessment centre status;

. Focus on sustaining an improvement apprenticeship completion rate;

. Improve the quality of learning underpinned by effective training officer continuous professional
development (CPD);

. Continue to be active in seeking to increase the number of apprenticeships and new employers through
proactive business development supported with quality candidate attraction; and

. Work on the curriculum design with delivery meeting or exceeds both employer and apprentice need and
expectations.

The achievement of our strategic objectives will seek to safeguard effective, high quality subcontracted delivery
along with our currently embedded proactive account management system across all business functions.

The Trustees are currently reviewing the management structure to ensure that the charity has the right
leadership to continue to deliver its charitable objective whilst ensuring it can continue for the long term future.

Trustees’ report (continued)
Year ended 31 July 2024

The trustees make and agree strategic objectives and policy decisions on behalf of the business. Implementing
the strategic and operational objectives along with the day to day running of the company is delegated to the key
management personnel.

Financial expenditure is authorised by two signatories required, including the chairman.

The number of trustees must not be less than three. No external body or person is entitled to appoint a trustee to
the board.

Organisation structure

The trustees provide delegated authority to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), who in turn leads the employees
to successfully operate the business and set the strategic direction. From 30 September 2024, the chair of the
board has acted as CEO on a temporary basis while the board seek to appoint a longer term solution into the
new role.

Pay policy for senior staff
All trustees give their time freely throughout the year without receiving any form of financial remuneration. Staff
salaries are reviewed annually by the board.

Risk Management
Several major risks to which the charity may be exposed to has been identified:

. An inadequate Ofsted inspection;
. Loss or withdrawal of ESFA contracts;
. Inadequate financial ESFA health grade leading to ESFA intervention;

Misalignment to ESFA subcontracting rules and regulations and therefore the non-award of the
subcontracting cap exemption status;
: Removal of the charity from the ESFA Register of Apprenticeship Training Providers (RoATP) list; and
. The loss of approval as an assessment centre for EAL and/or Pearson, all of which would render the
business unable to deliver engineering manufacturing and business & administration apprenticeships.

To mitigate risks and to ensure the quality and financial performance of the organisation does not give cause for
concern should the loss or withdrawal of these ESFA contracts; RoATP and/or approval centre status occur,
there are in place a number of policies, systems and procedures:

. Internal quality system designed in accordance with ESFA, Ofsted, EAL and Pearson, requirements;

. Board approved strategic and operational business objectives;

: A sound financial base, exercising financial probity with a minimum financial ‘satisfactory’ rating from the
ESFA;

. Continuous, close monitoring of ESFA funding rule changes, contractual requirements and minimum level

performance criteria along with the need to continually align its operations to Ofsted, Education Inspection
Framework (EIF) requirements;

. Ensure performance figures and success rates are consistently above national averages;

. Retain and employ expert, highly qualified and committed staff who regularly undertake training and CPD
activities; and

. Ensuring reports are consistent and favourable from EAL external verifier and Pearson standards verifier
audits.

Additional to the above there are always competitive risks and pressures from other training providers as
government funding, apprentice funding rate and the apprenticeship policy is continuously redefined within a
financially and operationally competitive environment.

Independent auditor's report to the Members of Tyne North Training Limited

Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of Tyne North Training Limited (the ‘charitable company’) for the year
ended 31 July 2024 which comprise the statement of financial activities, the balance sheet, the statement of
cash flows and the related notes, including a summary of significant accounting policies. The financial reporting
framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting
Standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 102 ‘The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK
and Republic of Ireland’ (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

In our opinion the financial statements:

e give a true and fair view of the state of the charitable company's affairs as at 31 July 2024 and of its
incoming resources and application of resources, including its income and expenditure for the year then
ended;

° have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice; and

. have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (‘ISAs (UK)') and applicable
law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit
of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the charitable company in accordance
with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the United Kingdom,
including the Financial Reporting Council's Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Conclusions relating to going concern

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the trustees’ use of the going concern basis of
accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or
conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the charitable company's ability to
continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are
authorised for issue.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the trustees with respect to going concern are described in the
relevant sections of this report.

Other information

The other information comprises the information included in the annual report other than the financial statements
and our auditor's report thereon. The trustees are responsible for the other information contained within the
annual report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the
extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. Our
responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is
materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material
misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial
statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material
misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

° the information given in the Trustees’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are
prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
° the Trustees’ report has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

Matters on which we are required to report by exception

In the light of our knowledge and understanding of the charitable company and its environment obtained in the
course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the Trustees’ report.

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which Companies Act 2006 requires
us to report to you if, in our opinion:

° adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been
received from branches not visited by us; or

the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or

certain disclosures of trustees' remuneration specified by law are not made; or

we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or

the trustees were not entitled to prepare the financial statements in accordance with the small companies
regime and take advantage of the small companies’ exemptions in preparing the Trustees’ report and
from the requirement to prepare a Strategic report.

Independent auditor's report to the Members of Tyne North Training Limited
(continued)

Responsibilities of trustees

As explained more fully in the trustees’ responsibilities statement, the trustees (who are also the directors of the
charitable company for the purposes of company law) are responsible for the preparation of the financial
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal contro! as the trustees
determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the trustees are responsible for assessing the charitable company's ability
to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going
concern basis of accounting unless the trustees either intend to liquidate the charitable company or to cease
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures
in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities,
including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is
detailed below:

We identified areas of law and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the
financial statements from our general and sector experience and through discussions with the directors and
other management (as required by Auditing Standards) and from inspection of the charity's legal
correspondence and we discussed with the directors and other management the policies and procedures in
place regarding compliance with laws and regulations. We communicated identified laws and regulations
throughout our audit team and remained alert to any indications of non-compliance throughout the audit.

Firstly, the charity is subject to laws and regulations that directly affect the financial statements including financial
reporting legislation (including related companies legislation), distributable profits legislation and taxation
legislation and we assessed the extent of compliance with these laws and regulations as part of our procedures
on the related financial statement items.

Secondly, the charity is subject to many other laws and regulations where the consequences of non-compliance
could have a material effect on amounts or disclosures in the financial statements, for instance through the
imposition of fines or litigation. We identified the following areas as those most likely to have such an effect;
health and safety, employment law, data protection, safeguarding, environmental law and certain aspects of
company legislation, recognising the nature of the charity's activities. Auditing Standards limit the required audit
procedures to identify non-compliance with these laws and regulations to enquiry of the directors and other
management and inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence, if any. Through these procedures we did
not become aware of any actual or suspected non-compliance material to the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of an audit, there is a risk that we will not detect all irregularities, including
those leading to a material misstatement in the financial statements or non-compliance with regulation. This risk
increases the more that compliance with a law or regulation is removed from the events and transactions
reflected in the financial statements, as we will be less likely to become aware of instances of non-compliance.
The risk is also greater regarding irregularities occurring due to fraud rather than error, as fraud involves
intentional concealment, forgery, collusion, omission or misrepresentation.

Notes to the financial statements
Year ended 31 July 2024

1. Accounting policies

A summary of the principal accounting policies adopted (which have been applied consistently, except
where noted), judgments and key sources of estimation uncertainty, is set out below. :

1.1

1.2

1.3

1.4

Basis of preparation of financial statements

The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Accounting and Reporting by
Charities: Statement of Recommended Practice applicable to charities preparing their accounts in
accordance with the Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland (FRS
102) (effective 1 January 2019), the Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic
of Ireland (FRS 102) and the Companies Act 2006.

Tyne North Training Limited meets the definition of a public benefit entity under FRS 102. Assets and
liabilities are initially recognised at historical cost or transaction value unless otherwise stated in the
relevant accounting policy.

The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention, are presented in pounds
sterling and rounded to the nearest £1.

Company status

The company is a company limited by guarantee, incorporated and domiciled in United Kingdom and
registered in England and Wales. The members of the company are the trustees named on page 1.
In the event of the company being wound up, the liability in respect of the guarantee is limited to £20
per member of the company.

Going concern

The trustees have concluded that the material uncertainty that existed in prior year has been
sufficiently resolved and there are no current material uncertainties about the charity's ability to
continue as a going concern. The charitable company continues to have a strong level of free
reserves of £717,267 to support the operations, a strong number of current apprentices in training
with more in the pipeline for the 2024/25 academic year and the sub-contracted exemption for the
2024/25 has been granted. The trustees will apply for the 2025/2026 year exemption at the
appropriate time and do not believe there are any reasonable grounds for this application to be
rejected. Therefore, the trustees believe there is sufficient certainty the charity has the ability to
continue as a going concern for at least 12 months from signing these financial statements.

Income
ESFA income is recognised in accordance with apprenticeship funding guidance based upon the

amount of progress made by the students concerned or on a straight line basis over the expected
duration of the apprenticeship for each student.

Expenditure

Expenditure is recognised once there is a legal or constructive obligation to transfer economic benefit
to a third party, it is probable that a transfer of economic benefits will be required in settlement and
the amount of the obligation can be measured reliably. Expenditure is classified by activity. The costs
of each activity are made up of the total of direct costs and shared costs, including support costs
involved in undertaking each activity. Direct costs attributable to a single activity are allocated directly
to that activity. Shared costs which contribute to more than one activity and support costs which are
not attributable to a single activity are apportioned between those activities on a basis consistent with
the use of resources. Central staff costs are allocated on the basis of time spent, and depreciation
charges allocated on the portion of the asset's use.

Expenditure on raising funds includes all expenditure incurred by the company to raise funds for its
charitable purposes and includes fees of investment managers relating to investments held for
income generation.

Expenditure on charitable activities is incurred on directly undertaking the activities which further the
company's objectives, as well as any associated support costs.

All expenditure is inclusive of irrecoverable VAT.

Interest receivable

Interest on funds held on deposit is included when receivable and the amount can be measured
reliably by the company; this is normally upon notification of the interest paid or payable by the
institution with whom the funds are deposited.

Tangible fixed assets and depreciation

Tangible fixed assets are carried at cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.

Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost of fixed assets, less their estimated
residual value, over their expected useful lives on the following bases:

Freehold property - over 50 years
Office equipment - 15% straight-line
Investments

Fixed asset investments are a form of financial instrument and are initially recognised at their
transaction cost and subsequently measured at fair value at the balance sheet date, unless the value
cannot be measured reliably in which case it is measured at cost less impairment. Investment gains
and losses, whether realised or unrealised, are combined and presented as ‘Gains/(Losses) on
investments’ in the statement of financial activities.

Debtors

Trade and other debtors are recognised at the settlement amount. Prepayments are valued at the
amount prepaid.

Accounting policies (continued)

1.10 Cash at bank and in hand

Cash and cash equivalents includes cash and short term highly liquid investments with a short
maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition or opening of the deposit or similar
account.

1.11 Liabilities and provisions

Liabilities are recognised when there is an obligation at the balance sheet date as a result of a past
event, it is probable that a transfer of economic benefit will be required in settlement, and the amount
of the settlement can be estimated reliably. Liabilities are recognised at the amount that the company
anticipates it will pay to settle the debt or the amount it has received as advanced payments for the
goods or services it must provide.

1.12 Financial instruments

The company only has financial assets and financial liabilities of a kind that qualify as basic financial
instruments. Basic financial instruments are initially recognised at transaction value and subsequently
measured at their settlement value with the exception of bank loans which are subsequently
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

1.13 Contingent liabilities

Contingent liabilities are not recognised. Contingent liabilities arise as a result of past events when (i)
it is not probable that there will be an outflow of resources or that the amount cannot be reliably
measured at the reporting date or (ii) when the existence will be confirmed by the occurrence or non-
occurrence of uncertain future events not wholly within the group’s control. Contingent liabilities are
disclosed in the financial statements unless the probability of an outflow of resources is remote.

1.14 Operating leases

Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to the statement of financial activities on a straight
line basis over the lease term.

1.15 Employee benefits

Short-term benefits
Short-term benefits, including other non-monetary benefits, are recognised as an expense in the
period in which the service is received.

Defined contribution pension plan

The company operates a defined contribution pension plan for its employees. Contributions are
recognised as an expense when they fall due. Amounts due but not yet paid are included within
creditors on the balance sheet. The assets of the plan are held separately from the company in
independently administered funds.

Subsequent to the year end, a legal claim has been brought against the charity which in part relates to
periods up to and including the year ended 31 July 2024. The board are seeking appropriate legal advice
and at this current time, the amount of the liability, if any, and subsequent timing of settlement, is

extremely uncertain therefore no amount can be reliably estimated.

Pension commitments

The charity operates a defined contribution pension scheme. The pension cost charge for the year
represents contributions payable by the charitable company which amounted to £37,970 (2023:

£132,321).
