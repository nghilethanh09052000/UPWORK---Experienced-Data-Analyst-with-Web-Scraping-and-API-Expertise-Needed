Chair Introduction

After a recruitment process, | was
thrilled to take on the Chair role

in May 24, following on from Andy
Watson's 3-year tenure. My thanks
go to him, for steering the Brathay
ship through a substantial period of
change not least impacted by COVID
but also a change in CEO in 2023.

As we reflect on the past year, it is

with immense pride and gratitude
that | present this overview of our

journey and achievements during

2023 to 2024.

With the recruitment of our new CEO
Teresa Jennings in July 2023, and with
support from a refreshed Board of
Trustees and a new Senior Leadership
Team, Teresa is driving a significant
change programme to ensure our
long term mission and objectives are
met.

The last 12 months have been marked
by both challenges and triumphs,
underscoring the resilience and
dedication of our team, volunteers,
and the communities we serve.

Despite the ongoing global
uncertainties, we have remained
steadfast in our vision to improve the
lives of young people, inspiring them
to build their brighter futures. Our
commitment to providing support,
guidance, and opportunities has
never been stronger, and this year, we
have seen remarkable progress in the
impact and outcomes our work has
delivered to over 7000 young people.
| have seen this first hand in many of
our projects, it is truly amazing.

Financial sustainability and strategic
income growth have also been at
the forefront of our agenda. Through
careful planning and resource
management, we have refocussed

Trustees’ Report and accounts 2023-
Company Registration Number: 2814206; Charity regist

our financial position, ensuring that
we can continue to offer our services
to those who need them most.

Moreover, we have begun to

forge new partnerships regionally
and nationally with corporates,

other Charities, and philanthropic
organisations, further solidifying our
foundation for future growth. We are
told by our beneficiaries that Brathay
is a special place, and we will continue
to invest in our infrastructure and
estate to create stories and memories
that endure.

As we look ahead, we remain very
optimistic and determined to build
on the successes of this year; and
ultimately building up towards our
5-year ambition of supporting over
40,000 young people by 2029.

As ever, | extend my heartfelt thanks
to everyone involved with Brathay
Trust - your dedication, passion, and
support make all the difference.
Together, we are creating lasting
change and paving the way for a
brighter future for the young people
we serve.

There is much to do, and your
contributions to our delivery are vital
and very much appreciated.

Trustees’ Responsibilities

Trustees (who are also directors of
Brathay Trust for the purposes of
company law) are responsible for
preparing the trustees’ annual report
and the financial statements in
accordance with applicable law and
regulations.

Company law requires trustees to
prepare financial statements for each
financial year. Under that law the
trustees have elected to prepare the
financial statements in accordance
with United Kingdom Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice (United
Kingdom Accounting Standards and
applicable law), including FRS 102,
The Financial Reporting Standard
applicable in the UK and Republic of
lreland.

Under company law the trustees
must not approve the financial
statements unless they are satisfied
that they give a true and fair view of
the state of affairs of the charitable
company and the group and of the
incoming resources and application
of resources, including the income
and expenditure, of the charitable
group for that period. In preparing

. these financial statements, the
trustees are required to:

select suitable accounting policies
and then apply them consistently;

observe the methods and
principles in the Charities SORP
(FRS 102);

+ make judgments and accounting
estimates that are reasonable and
prudent;

state whether applicable UK
Accounting Standards have
been followed, subject to any
material departures disclosed
and explained in the financial
statements; and

prepare the financial statements
on the going concern basis unless
it is inappropriate to presume that
the charitable group will continue
in business.

The trustees are responsible for
keeping adequate accounting
records that are sufficient to show
and explain the charitable company’s
transactions and disclose with
reasonable accuracy at any time the
financial position of the company
and enable them to ensure that the
financial statements comply with

the Companies Act 2006. They are
also responsible for safeguarding the
assets of the charitable company and
hence for taking reasonable steps for
the prevention and detection of fraud
and other irregularities.

The trustees confirm that:

- so far as each trustee is aware,
there is no relevant audit
information of which the
charitable company’s auditor is
unaware; and

+ the trustees have taken all the
steps that they ought to have
taken as trustees in order to
make themselves aware of any
relevant audit information and
to establish that the charitable
company’s auditor is aware of that
information.

The trustees are responsible for the
maintenance and integrity of the
corporate and financial information
included on the charitable
company's website. Legislation in
the United Kingdom governing the
preparation and dissemination of
financial statements may differ from
legislation in other jurisdictions.

Company Registration Number: 2814206; Charity registration number 1021586;

Trustee appointments

When recruiting new trustees against
the Board skill matrix, the Board
looks for members whose skills

and backgrounds complement and
enhance the existing team. Vacancies
are advertised and trustees, staff

and other interested parties may
nominate a person for consideration.

Brathay promotes and values diversity
within the trustee body, recognising
the importance of having a wide
range of views, knowledge and
experiences leading the organisation.
Potential new trustees meet with the
Chair, Chief Executive and trustees
before being elected to the Board.
They are provided with information
about Brathay and visit the head
office in Ambleside and/or one of our
regional offices.

Trustee effectiveness

Following their appointment, each
trustee receives a briefing pack and
comprehensive induction. This covers
their role, duties and accountabilities
as a trustee and includes information
about Brathay, our policies, structure
and work. Particular importance

is placed on matters relating to
safeguarding and child protection.
As part of this process, trustees are
encouraged to observe Brathay’s
work.

Each trustee completes a register

of interests and related party
transactions; this register is updated
annually and whenever any changes
occur.

Risk management

Trustees have overall responsibility
for ensuring that Brathay has an
appropriate system of control and for
taking suitable steps to safeguard
Brathay’s assets.

Asummary of the major risks to
which Brathay is exposed, and
the relevant mitigating factors, is
maintained in a risk register.

Risks are reviewed twice a year by
trustees. They work closely with

the leadership team to ensure that
Brathay has appropriate policies,
systems and procedures to manage
the risks facing Brathay.

Key risks

Trustees recognise that Brathay faces
risk in a wide range of areas including:

financial risks

health and safety
information management
people

reputational risks
safeguarding
technological risks

In all cases control measures are in
place and regularly reviewed. These
controls are designed to reduce

the risk to an acceptable level. In
considering the biggest risks Brathay
faces, as a charity working with a
wide range of people, including some
of the most vulnerable, the correct
management of safeguarding is key.
Following on from this, both data
and information management need
to be robust. Additionally to ensure
an on-going and sustainable impact,
financial risks must be effectively
managed.

Objectives, aims and public benefit

Brathay's objectives, as set out in
the memorandum and articles of
association, are:

+ toestablish and maintain a
centre or centres in any part of
Great Britain for the education,

Trustees’ Report and accounts 2023-24
Company Registration Number: 2814206; Charity registration number 1021586;

including the physical training and
moral, intellectual and physical
development, of young persons
from within the United Kingdom;

to initiate and prosecute, whether
at the said centres or elsewhere,
investigation and research into
questions affecting the education
of such persons;

* to instruct the staff of such centres
and other persons to qualify them
to promote the aforesaid purposes;
and

to promote any other charitable
purposes of an educational nature
relating to any of the purposes
aforesaid.

It should be noted that while the
language of the objectives is now
very dated, the spirt behind the words
remains the same and Brathay seeks
to deliver its work in an inclusive
manner which recognises and values
diversity.

Our vision and the reason why
Brathay Trusts exists is to inspire
young people to build their brighter
futures. Brathay has been inspiring
young people for over 75 years
through activities and adventures
on our beautiful estate overlooking
Windermere, and through
programmes delivered directly in
communities throughout Cumbria
and Bradford.

Brathay continues to be focused on
delivering its strategic ambition of
inspiring over 40,000 young people to
build their brighter futures by 2029. To
do this it is focussing on the following
pillars which will underpin our plans
and strategies:

+ Cultivating a unified Brathay
culture

- Excellence in service delivery

Ensuring financial stability
- Strategic income generation

+ Effective Governance and Board
leadership

Funding our work

Brathay supports the standards as
set out in The Code of Fundraising
Practice and has subscribed to the
Fundraising Regulator. The code has
a number of reporting requirements
and we report as follows:

Our processes and practices are
designed to ensure compliance
with the standards cited.

There have been no complaints in
relation to fundraising activity.

We take appropriate steps
to ensure the data security
of personal information of

individuals.

The organisation has appropriate
controls to ensure the protection
of vulnerable people and others
from unreasonable intrusion on a
person’s privacy and unreasonably
persistent approaches or undue
pressure to donate, in the

course of or in connection with
fundraising for Brathay.

Our income streams are varied. Some
work is directly commissioned, such
as by local authorities, whilst other
work is paid for by funding from
trusts and foundations, corporate
sponsorship, surpluses generated

by fundraising events, the trading
activities of Brathay’s subsidiary,
appeals and individual giving.

When funding is received it is not
taken as income in the accounts until
the programme or project it relates

to is delivered. Any amounts received
in this way are included as deferred
income. This is the case irrespective of

Trustees’ Report and accounts 2023-24
Company Registration Number: 2814206; Charity registration number 1021586;

the source of the income.

Income that comes from funders,
tenders and events involves
considerable upfront time and
resource, often with a significant
delay between this investment being
made and the income showing in the
accounts.

Utilising volunteers to help us in our
efforts

Brathay works in partnership with
volunteers to ensure they feel valued
and have a high quality experience,
where possible providing them

with personal or organisational
development opportunities. The
support of volunteers and local
communities is key to our success
and is very much appreciated.

Developing partnerships

Partnership working and even greater
collaboration is integral to the future
success of Brathay. By developing our
partnership network in a strategic
way it will help drive sustainable
growth, innovation and greater social
impact for the Trust and its partners.
It also helps enhance our ability to
deliver impactful programmes and

services. This collaborative approach
ensures that the Trust can offer
comprehensive and diverse support
to the communities we serve,
addressing a wider range of needs
and challenges.

We are grateful to all our current
partners, which include donors, local
authorities, businesses, charities,
schools, youth groups, universities,
and colleges.

Achievements and Performance

The trustees confirm that they have
referred to the guidance contained
in the Charity Commission's general
guidance on public benefit when
reviewing objectives and activities
described in this section.

Our impact and outcomes for
2023-2024 can be seen in our
annual impact report.

Brathay in Summary

Our Vision

Inspiring young people to build their
brighter futures

Our Mission

Through transformative experiences,
learning and community support,
Brathay Trust exists to ignite the
potential within every young person,
so they can thrive in a rapidly
changing world.

Our Strategic Objective

To inspire 40,000 young people to
build their brighter future by 2029

Brathay Trust works with

young people through their
transformative early years from
5 years old right through to their
early careers (21+ years old).

Brathay delivers in two main
settings:

On the Brathay Estate

in Ambleside - these are
predominantly residential
based programmes

+ Deeper work with young
people and their families
in the community - South
Cumbria and Bradford

We also blend this approach
so that young people are often
able to benefit from support
in both settings.

The diagram below is an illustration
of the range of organisations we work
with and projects we deliver over
that age span of 5+ to 21+ both on the
Brathay Estate (above the line) and in
the Community (below the line).

Financial Review

The accounts, which form part of this
report, comply with the requirements
of FRS102 - The Financial Reporting
Standard applicable in the UK and
Republic of Ireland. The trustees
consider that in preparing these
accounts, they have consistently
applied appropriate accounting
policies supported by reasonable and
prudent judgements and estimates
where required.

Summary

The results for the year showed a
slight fall in income as the various
income streams normalised in

the first full year which had been
unaffected by the pandemic since
2019-20. With a management focus
on aligning costs with income, there
was also an overall reduction in costs,
which was a remarkable achievement
during a year of high inflation. The
year ended with a loss rather than the
break even position which had been
forecast on account of a fall in income

offset by a reduction in costs.
Income review

Income for the year was £5,215k
compared to £5,533k in 2023. The
reduction was attributable to
changes to some key contracts in
our community programmes, and a
change to the client base in our work
with 16+ and early careers young
people. We continue to develop work
in communities where support to
young people and their families has
been crucial, and work closely with
funders and donors and are very
grateful to all those who partner with,
and support us.

cashflow management strategy and
helps to manage the risk inherent

in drawing on investments in an
otherwise unplanned manner. The
cash position is regularly reviewed by
Trustees.

Trustees take a five year view on
investment performance and are
satisfied that investments have
performed in line with wider markets.

Liquidity & Reserves

During the year, the Trustees
reviewed the reserves policy and took
the decision to move to a ‘Liquidity .
and Reserves Policy’.

Historically, Brathay adopted a ‘Free
Reserves’ policy which is defined

by the Charities’ Statement of
Recommended Practice (SORP) as
‘total unrestricted reserves, less fixed
assets and investments, net of long-
term finance’. Trustees have reviewed
this approach alongside Brathay’s
risk matrix, the business model, the
5-year business plan, the cashflow
profile and with consideration to
external stakeholder requirements. In
consideration of all of these elements,
Trustees and the Senior Leadership
Team have agreed that a policy based
on liquidity is a more appropriate
measure of financial stability for
Brathay.

Going forward, the Trust will hold a

cash (or cash equivalent) balance of
between 3 and 6 months’ operating
costs. The Trust has met this policy
for the last 10 years.

Liquidity at 31 March 2024 (cash
plus investment) totalled £1,378k.
3 months’ operating costs as of 31
March 2024 were £1,086k.

Going concern

The accounts have been prepared

on a going concern basis. Trustees
have carefully considered the steps
that Brathay has taken and the
actions necessary to ensure a stable
future. Brathay has sufficient reserves
to manage the liquidity of the
organisation on an on-going basis.

A rigorous and detailed planning
process has been completed.

The delivery of plans is regularly
reviewed and closely monitored in
order to ensure effective business
management. Trustees recognise
there may continue to be an
occasional need to utilise investments
as a result of historical losses already
sustained and investment in the
future.

Post balance sheet events

There are no significant post balance
sheet events to report.

Independent Auditor’s Report
to the Trustees and Members of

Brathay Trust
Year ended 31 March 2024

Opinion

-We have audited the financial
statements of Brathay Trust (the
‘charitable company’) for the year
ended 31 March 2024 which comprise
the consolidated Statement of
Financial Activities (including
income and expenditure account),
consolidated Balance Sheet,
consolidated Cash Flow Statement
and the related notes, including a
summary of significant accounting
policies. The financial reporting
framework that has been applied in
their preparation is applicable law
and United Kingdom Accounting
Standards, including FRS 102 The
Financial Reporting Standard
applicable in the UK and Republic of
Ireland (United Kingdom Generally

. Accepted Accounting Practice).

In our opinion the financial
statements:

give a true and fair view of the
state of the charitable company’s

of its incoming resources and
application of resources, including
its income and expenditure for the
year then ended;

+ have been properly prepared in
accordance with United Kingdom
Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice;

have been prepared in accordance
with the requirements of the
Companies Act 2006.

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in
accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs
(UK)) and applicable law. Our
responsibilities under those standards
are further described in the auditor’s
responsibilities for the audit of the
financial statements section of our
report. We are independent of the
charitable company in accordance
with the ethical requirements that are
relevant to our audit of the financial
statements in the UK, including

the FRC’s Ethical Standard, and

we have fulfilled our other ethical
responsibilities in accordance with
these requirements. We believe that
the audit evidence we have obtained
is sufficient and appropriate to
provide a basis for our opinion.

Conclusions relating to going
concern

In auditing the financial statements,
we have concluded that the trustees’
use of the going concern basis of
accounting in the preparation of the
financial statements is appropriate.

Based on the work we have
performed, we have not identified
any material uncertainties relating to
events or conditions that, individually
or collectively, may cast significant
doubt on the charitable company's
ability to continue as a going concern
for a period of at least twelve months
from when the financial statements
are authorised for issue.

Our responsibilities and the

responsibilities of the trustees

with respect to going concern are
described in the relevant sections of
this report.

Other information

The other information comprises the
information included in the annual
report, other than the financial
statements and our auditor's report
thereon. The trustees are responsible
for the other information. Our opinion
on the financial statements does

not cover the other information

and, except to the extent otherwise
explicitly stated in our report, we do
not express any form of assurance
conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of

the financial statements, our
responsibility is to read the other
information and, in doing so, consider
whether the other information

is materially inconsistent with

the financial statements or our
knowledge obtained in the audit or
otherwise appears to be materially
misstated. If we identify such
material inconsistencies or apparent
material misstatements, we are
required to determine whether
there is a material misstatement

in the financial statements or a
material misstatement of the other.
information. If, based on the work
we have performed, we conclude
that there is a material misstatement
of this other information, we are
required to report that fact. We have
nothing to report in this regard.

Opinions on other matters prescribed
by the Companies Act 2006

In our opinion, based on the work
undertaken in the course of the audit:

+ the information given in the
Trustees’ Report, which includes
the Directors’ Report prepared for
the purposes of company law for

the financial year for which the
financial statements are prepared
is consistent with the financial
statements; and

the Directors’ Report included
within the Trustees’ Report has
been prepared in accordance with
applicable legal requirements.

Matters on which we are required
to report by exception

In the light of the knowledge and
understanding of the charitable
company and its environment
obtained in the course of the audit,
we have not identified material
misstatements in the Directors’
Report included within the Trustees’
Report.

We have nothing to report in respect
of the following matters in relation
to which the Companies Act 2006
requires us to report to you if, in our
opinion:

adequate accounting records
have not been kept, or returns
adequate for our audit have not
been received from branches not
visited by us; or

+ the financial statements are not
in agreement with the accounting
records and returns; or

certain disclosures of trustees’
remuneration specified by law are
not made; or

we have not received all the
information and explanations we
require for our audit; or

the trustees were not entitled to
prepare the financial statements in
accordance with the small companies
regime and take advantage of the
small companies exemption from the
requirement to prepare a Strategic
Report.

Company Registration Number: 2814206; Charity registration number 1021586;

Responsibilities of directors

As explained more fully in the
trustees’ responsibilities statement,
the trustees (who are also the
directors of the charitable company
for the purposes of company law)
are responsible for the preparation
of the financial statements and for
being satisfied that they give a true
and fair view, and for such internal
control as the trustees determine is
necessary to enable the preparation
of financial statements that are free
from material misstatement, whether
due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements,
the trustees are responsible for
assessing the charitable company's
ability to continue as a going
concern, disclosing, as applicable,
matters related to going concern

and using the going concern basis of
accounting unless the trustees either
intend to liquidate the company or to
cease operations, or have no realistic
alternative but to do so.

Auditor’s responsibilities for the
audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements as a whole
are free from material misstatement,
whether due to fraud or error, and to
issue an auditor's report that includes
our opinion. Reasonable assurance is
a high level of assurance but is not a
guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with ISAs (Uk) will always
detect a material misstatement when
it exists. Misstatements can arise from
fraud or error and are considered
material if, individually or in the
aggregate, they could reasonably be
expected to influence the economic
decisions of users taken on the basis
of these financial statements.

Irregularities, including fraud,

are instances of non-compliance
with laws and regulations. We
design procedures in line with our
responsibilities, outlined above, to
detect material misstatements in
respect of irregularities, including
fraud. The extent to which our
procedures are capable of detecting
irregularities, including fraud is
detailed below:

The objectives of our audit in respect
of fraud are: to identify and assess the
risks of material misstatement of the
financial statements due to fraud; to
obtain sufficient appropriate audit
evidence regarding the assessed

risks of material misstatement

due to fraud, through designing

and implementing appropriate
responses to those assessed risks;

and to respond appropriately to
instances of fraud or suspected fraud
identified during the audit. However,
the primary responsibility for the
prevention and detection of fraud
rests with both management and
those charged with governance of the
charitable company.

Our approach was as follows:

+ We obtained an understanding
of the legal and regulatory
requirements applicable to
the charitable company and
considered that the most
significant are: Accounting and
Reporting by Charities: Statement
of Recommended Practice
applicable to Charities preparing
their accounts in accordance
with The Financial Reporting
Standard applicable in the UK
and Republic of ireland (FRS 102)
(Charities SORP (FRS 102)), FRS 102
The Financial Reporting Standard
applicable in the UK and Republic

estimates and related disclosures
made by the trustees.

Conclude on the appropriateness
of the trustees’ use of the going
concern basis of accounting and,
based on the audit evidence
obtained, whether a material
uncertainty exists related to
events or conditions that may cast
significant doubt on the charitable
company's ability to continue as

a going concern. If we conclude
that a material uncertainty exists,
we are required to draw attention
in our auditor’s report to the
related disclosures in the financial
statements or, if such disclosures
are inadequate, to modify our
opinion. Our conclusions are based
on the audit evidence obtained

up to the date of our auditor’s
report. However, future events

or conditions may cause the
charitable company to cease to
continue as a going concern.

+ Evaluate the overall presentation,
structure and content of the
financial statements, including
the disclosures, and whether the
financial statements represent
the underlying transactions and
events in a manner that achieves
fair presentation.

We communicate with those

charged with governance regarding,
among other matters, the planned
scope and timing of the audit and
significant audit findings, including
any significant deficiencies in internal
control that we identify during our
audit.

Use of our report

This report is made solely to the
charitable company’s members, as

a body, in accordance with chapter

3 of part 16 of the Companies Act
2006. Our audit work has been
undertaken so that we might state to
the charitable company’s members
those matters we are required to state
to them in an auditor's report and for
no other purpose. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or
assume responsibility to anyone other
than the charitable company and

the charitable company’s members
as a body, for our audit work, for this
report, or for the opinions we have
formed.

Notes to the Financial Statements
For the year ended 31 March 2024

1. Company Status

Brathay Trust (Brathay) is a charitable company limited by guarantee (incorporated in the UK).
The liability in respect of the guarantee, as set out in the Memorandum of Association, is limited
to £1 per member of the company. The members of the company, who are also directors, are the
trustees.

Company Registration Number: 2814206. Charity registration number 1021586
The registered office is:

Brathay Hall ,

Clappersgate

Ambleside

Cumbria

LA22 OHP

2. Accounting Policies

Basis of Preparation

The financial statements are prepared in accordance with the following and on a going concern
basis

- applicable UK accounting standards
the historical cost convention, as modified by the inclusion of investments at market value,

the Statement of Recommended Practice Accounting and Reporting by Charities FRS 102,
(‘the SORP’), the Companies Act 2006 and the Charities Act 201]

Brathay Trust meets the definition of a public benefit entity under FRS102.
Going Concern

The trustees and officers have considered their obligation to prepare financial statements on

an appropriate basis, having specific regard to Brathay's net liability position. This results from
income being received in advance of projects being delivered, as has been the position for many
years, and is part of normal operations.

The trustees have also assessed the impact of budgets, working capital needs, cash and
investments. As a result, they are of the opinion that Brathay has sufficient reserves to be able
to meet its obligations as they fall due and accordingly the accounts have been prepared ona
going concern basis.

Basis of Consolidation

The consolidated accounts of the group incorporate the accounts of the charity and its subsidiary
undertaking both of which are prepared to 31 March 2024. The trading results of the subsidiary
undertaking as shown in note 14 are consolidated on a line-by-line basis within the consolidated
Statement of Financial Activities. A separate Statement of Financial Activities for the charity is
not presented as permitted by the SORP and the Companies Act 2006.

Income

Donations, other than for specific projects and fundraising appeals, are accounted for at the time
of receipt. Donations for specific projects or appeals are deferred until the projects to which they
relate are delivered.

All deferred income is accounted for in note 11.

25

Trustees’ Report and accounts 2023-24
Company Registration Number: 2814206; Charity registration number 1021586;

26

Donations in kind are included within voluntary income and are included at their estimated
market value.

Income from capital grants is accounted for when entitlement to the grant becomes
unconditional. Until that point it is deferred. Capital grants are accounted for within the
restricted reserve.

Income from fees and grants for delivering charitable activities is accounted for on the basis
of the amount receivable for services delivered in the year. Income received in advance of the
delivery of the activity to which it relates is deferred. Income of this sort is accounted for within
the restricted reserve.

Income from other activities, including entry fees for events, rents, accommodation and bar sales
is accounted for as the service, supply or event to which they relate is delivered.

Investment income is accounted for as receivable.
Expenditure

All expenditure is accounted for on the accruals basis as it is incurred and irrecoverable VAT
is allocated to the category to which it relates. Some central support costs are allocated to
expenditure categories on a basis that is consistent with the use of those resources.

The costs of generating funds and cost of charitable activities include an element of indirect
support costs. Support costs represent the staff costs incurred in providing direct support to
Brathay’s programmes. These include costs relating to central finance, human resources, IT,
health and safety and corporate communications. They have been apportioned between the
costs of generating funds and cost of charitable activities on a basis consistent with the use of
those resources.

Defined contribution pension schemes
Pension contributions are charged to the Statement of Financial Activities as incurred.
Operating leases

Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the Statement of Financial Activities as
incurred over the term of the lease.

Tangible Fixed Assets

Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less depreciation charged to date. Brathay capitalises
assets or groups of assets with an initial cost in excess of £1,000 and depreciation is calculated to
write off the cost of each asset on a straight-line basis over its expected economic life. The lives
used are as follows: .

Improvements to leasehold property: the lesser of 25 years, the life of the lease or the useful
economic life of the asset.

Equipment, fixtures and fittings and motor vehicles: 2-10 years

No impairment review is required and finance costs are not capitalised within the cost of the
asset. :

Financial Instruments

Brathay only has financial assets and financial liabilities of a kind that qualify as basic financial
instruments. They are initially recognised at transaction value and subsequently measured at
amortised cost.

Financial assets held at amortised cost comprise cash at bank and in hand, together with trade
and other debtors.

Financial liabilities held at amortised cost comprise trade and other creditors.

Trustees’ Report and accounts 2023-24
Company Registration Number: 2814206; Charity registration number 1021586;

Investments

Investments are stated at market value. Movements in unrealised gains and losses on
revaluation of fixed asset investments are included under ‘gains on investments’ in the
Statement of Financial Activities.

Reserves: Unrestricted funds

General funds are available for use at the discretion of the Trustees in furtherance of the
objectives of the Charity and which have not been designated for other purposes.

The trustee reserve is an expendable endowment which trustees have the power to convert
into ‘income’. Distinguishable from ‘income’ by the absence of a positive duty on the part of
the trustees to apply it for the purposes of the charity, unless and until this power to convert
into ‘income’ is actually exercised. Trustees apply the income from the Trustee Reserve at their
discretion.
