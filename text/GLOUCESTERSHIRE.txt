CHAIRPERSON’S REPORT
For the year ended 31 August 2024

CHAIRPERSON’S REPORT 2023-2024

Academic year 2023 /24 has seen GET return to normal operational numbers around recruitment and delivery. Following on
from 2022/2023 where we saw growth in apprenticeship numbers, HE and commercial training opportunities. Currently we
have 10 learners who are out of the apprenticeship funding, however we have successfully supported a further 99 through End
Point Assessment. GET has developed and adapted significantly in its operational approach to ensure the Apprentices were
trained to support our employer succession planning. Academic year 2023/2024 has an increased intake of Apprentices (138),
Level 4 (34), Level 3 (104) across our Barnwood and Cinderford sites, and a new cohort of 39 HE learners start on HNC/D.

itis hard to believe that we had our Ofsted inspection over a year ago, where we achieved a Good grade but were very close
to being rated Outstanding. We have continued to improve on the feedback provided to ensure we achieve an outstanding
grade at the next inspection cycle, this has included updating our business functions, delivery planning as well as updating our
board to become a board of governors with the focus on the quality of education and safeguarding. This has been enhanced
with our reporting platform called five streams which reports on the quality of education, behaviour & attitudes, personal
development, leadership & management which are underpinned by safeguarding and finance.

The appointment of a Training & Maintenance Manager has enabled GET to grow our commercial skills offering, creating more
bespoke training packages to meet our employer needs around welding& fabrication, machining, electrical safety and
electronics to name but a few. We have also seen a steady increase in the delivery of direct NVQs in the workplace to support
current staff in employment. GET also purchased a vehicle to support the centre's at Barnwood and Cinderford with our
logistical needs. We decided to have the van branded which has supported marketing and we have had several business
interventions from this.

Our satellite centre in the Forest of Dean welcomed our first cohort of 11 apprentices for training in September 2023. The main
aim of the project is to reduce our carbon footprint and to support the young Apprentices in the Forest, with the logistical
challenge of getting into Barnwood. Many are aged between 16-17 and non-drivers, who are reliant on public transport which
has not been the best. This allows the first years from the Forest to complete the Level 2 practical skills nearer home and
attend GET on a day release basis in Years 2 and 3. We have 20 learners joining us at the Cinderford site in September 2024,
some of our employers requested we adapt our delivery method at short notice to include the new learners attending the
academic delivery at Barnwood to ensure that all their learners progressed at the same speed. This was achieved and the
delivery mode! has now been updated to be four days at the Cinderford site and one day in Bamwood.

There has most definitely been an improvement in the apprenticeship cohort as we did notice significant challenges with
previous intakes due to the school closures and CAG's (Centre Assessments Grades) which had a negative impact on our
leamers’ both academically and socially. The academic qualification has proved a challenge for some learners, where there
have been several learners fail their Math’s and Materials units. GET has however provided support to ensure most of the
learner's progress. Higher Education learners continue to progress on a positive trajectory which is great news.

There have been agreements to provide additional paid support for learners this academic year at both Level 2 or Level 3
Technical Certificate and practical delivery. Just 1 learner failed one or more modules of their HNC/D. A very big improvement
in comparison to the previous two Academic years, which is thanks to the dedication of the Academic Team and the support
of the employers. :

As always, a review of the delivery year was undertaken, with measures put in place to avoid similar issues with learners
failing. We have adapted the curriculum delivery plan and allocated sessions at the end of the year to support those learners
who were close to passing.

Positively, all timetabled delivery for the practical delivery was successfully completed by the last week in July. Thanks to the
dedication and support of the Staff within the Practical Delivery Team, all the learners can now progress to the development
(Level 3) stage of their Apprenticeship.

Financially, as anticipated, we have performed extremely well this academic year, with surplus of £551,757. Recruitment for
2024/2025 has been very positive, with the biggest intake to date Level 3 Apprentices (105 in Barnwood and 20 in Forest of
Dean) and Level 4 Apprentices (29), a total of 154 Apprentices and 54 new Higher Education learners added to the current
groups of HE leamers.

Although the average number of Staff has remained the same year on year, we have successfully recruited two additional
Academic Tutors, two Instructors. We continue with our succession planning for staff to ensure we have strength in depth
moving forward.

GET won the Training champion skills partner award at the UK Enginuity awards in June, this is in recognition of the outstanding
work done to support and develop the future engineers in the UK. This award also recognises our continuous improvement
and investment in our staff and equipment at the centre.

GLOUCESTERSHIRE ENGINEERING TRAINING LIMITED (By Guarantee)
CHAIRPERSON’S REPORT
For the year ended 31 August 2024

We are very mindful of the external pressures around the economy and continue to monitor and discuss any implications with
our trusted employer partners on a regular basis, this supports our regular business plan and strategy review. This also included
the new education reforms around technical education and the current review of the apprenticeship standards. Part of this
strategy is growth of the HE delivery to support the demand from learners and employers. We have very recently agreed to
take on the lease of unit 2.4 which will enable GET to grow the total number of HE learners to 240 from the current 130 which

has been restricted due to space.

We have continued to repay our shortfall deposit deficits with all employers and have a payment plan in place with two of our
customers. This was done to reduce the company's liabilities and finance future growth; we have agreed with employers for
them to stop paying shortfall deposits and in return GET will ringfence their outstanding refunds as designated to offset the
Year 1 Apprenticeship funding deficit and to finance growth. We have agreed an interest free loan with one of our employer
partners to return the shortfall deposits over a period of ten years, The shortfall deposit liability has reduced £125,710 year on

year.

Ithas been a challenging year for everyone, but as a training provider we have made significant strides forward. | want to thank
all the Staff at GET for their continued hard work, efforts, and commitments during these extremely busy but positive times. t
would also like to thank all our customers and Board of Govemors for their patience, input and ongoing support.

Well done and a big thank you.

GLOUCESTERSHIRE ENGINEERING TRAINING LIMITED (By Guarantee)
GOVERNOR'S REPORT
For the year ended 31 August 2024

As a Charity we regularly benchmark our remuneration and benefits packages against a variety of measures — firstly we
took at the local market rates by comparing our salaries and T&Cs against our competitors, we look at benchmarking
against other Group Training Associations (GTA) across the UK and use national statistics from public research (KPMG.
etc.), We aim to make sure we are at least competitive and are paying the market rates but also need to make our offer
attractive without being overly excessive to the market position. This activity is completed internally by HR and the CEO
and presented and discussed at Board level. Board directors who have a suitable background have also carried out these

reviews as a supporting measure.
External Stakeholders

Gloucestershire Engineering Training Limited is audited by the Department of Education (DofE), Education and Skills
Funding Agency (ESFA), Office for standards in education (Ofsted) and Education Awarding Organisations (Aos) in order
to deliver approved Apprenticeship Standards.

Objectives and Strategies

The Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Charitable Company state that the objects for which the Charitable
Company is established are: .

i) to promote and advance adequate training of persons employed or intending to be employed in industry and
commerce.
ii) subject to the foregcing object, to extend such training to members of the public generally.

The objectives are achieved by the provisions of a training centre, offering both the Skills and Knowledge aspects of the
programme, and contracts with each Employer. The contracts are funded by the Apprenticeship Levy for full
Apprenticeships or on a commerciat basis for Skills training. There have been no major policy changes during the year.

Strategic Report

Achievements and Performance

Given the challenges we have faced over the last thirty-six months, the Trustees think it is commendable how the
organisation and the staff within have adapted and grown the business and opened a satellite centre within the Forest
of Dean.

Practical Delivery — the training year ended on time a high number of first year learners completed their training, 98
out of the 102 recruited passing. The learners who were not successful were withdrawn from the apprenticeship
scheme by their employers for failing to meet the behavioural requirements of the apprenticeship programme. Some
leamers finished slightly earlier and retumed to their employer's premises ahead of the revised date or were given
additional free training to support the stretch in their development. The 15 level 2 apprentices are progressing well and
13 have completed their end point assessment (EPA).

Academic Delivery - the Academic delivery finished as planned. We have most definitely noticed a difference in abilities
of the younger apprentices this academic year. Far more support sessions have been provided over the last tweive
months, particularly in areas such as Mathematics and materials for the tevel 3 apprentices.

Failure rates for the academic year 2023-2024 have improved significantly. Learners who unfortunately failed modules
were given the opportunity to repeat the training at the end of the academic year or return for a short period in
September 2024. The failures were down the learners’ attitude and engagement or in some instances capability or
poor retention. Apprenticeship success rates at GET did drop as low as 67%, with the national average as low as
53.4%, this was due to leaver and the delay in completing EPA, however these are now increasing very rapidly to the
levet we are accustomed to, and we have a completion rate of 89.2%.

Skills Development Team — A high volume of work was carried out to keep learners progressing, the recruitment of
dedicated staff to support EPA has been very positive, staff have provided well above and beyond the requirements
of the on-pragramme training. We have supported employers with more engagement visits and provided support for
EPA, such as interview techniques and reviewing learner EPA submission documents.

There is still a delay in learners who need to complete EPA (End Point Assessment), 46 currently. The team is working
hard with the employers to get the apprenticeships completed and we have recruited a further member of staff within the
team to support this and support with succession planning.

GLOUCESTERSHIRE ENGINEERING TRAINING LIMITED (By Guarantee)
GOVERNOR’S REPORT
For the year ended 31 August 2024

HE numbers interestingly have also seen a significant increase, with more learners following a level 4 apprenticeship route
to complete their HNC/D. The commercial training aspect at GET continues to grow in both skills training and direct NVQs,
and the appointment of a skills and maintenance manager has supported this continued growth.

We have been able to show more commitment to our charitable objectives this year and have provided support for two
external organisations as well as supporting employing an individual with academic learning limitations.

Financial Review

The budget for 2023-2024 predicted a surplus of £324k. 6 months into the year, we provided a reforecast for the remainder
of the year and made a small adjustment to end the year with a budgeted surplus of £299k.

We ended 2023-2024 with a net surplus on unrestricted funds of £552k, £252k higher than the forecast mainly due to the
annual accrued income adjustment for leavers of £188k and additional commercial sales income. During this financial
year, the shortfall deposit reserve has increased by a further £50k to £780k with a further two companies signing contracts
to transfer balances.

Overall, this has resulted in an increase to reserves of £602k (see note 16) which supports GET’s initiative to build a £1.2m
reserve to cover the year 1 additional costs, as well as to provide future financial stability & continuity.

The 2024-2025 training year has started very well with 154 learners starting their apprenticeships (123 Level 3 & 31 Level
4) at GET in September 2024 and, together with the successes of this year, we are expecting to end 2024-2025 with a
surplus of £287k.

Principal Funding Sources

The principal funding source is primarily our employer customer base supported by the Education and Skill Funding Agency
funding for Apprenticeships in the main via the Apprenticeship Levy. All businesses regardiess of size are supported by
the apprenticeship levy, either via 5% contribution from the employer or co-investment approach.

We understand the requirements under Charity regulations to disclose our involvement in fundraising. The Charity is not
involved in such activities as all monies are generated from commercial activities and charitable activities funded by local
employers, supported by government funding. The Charitable Company does not have any volunteers.

Investment Policy

The Charitable Company does not have an investment portfolio. All funds are held in bank deposit accounts and monitored
regularly by the Board.

Reserves Policy

The total funds of the Company were £2,020k (2023: £1,419k). The designated funds of £780k (2023: £730k) will be used
to support the future stability and growth of the Company.

The Trustees reserves policy is to build and have sufficient funds to cover 3 to 6 months’ operating costs if apprenticeship
funding ceased to exist. At 31 August 2024, the total unrestricted reserve, excluding designated funds was £1,240k (2023:
£689k) with fixed assets valued at £263k (2023: £292k) resulting in free reserves of £977k (2023: £397k), which is
comfortably within this range. We also have designated funds to finance what were the shortfall deposits from employers
and provide financial security to the charitable organisation.

Plans for Future Periods
Anew 10-year lease has been agreed with a 5 year break out option for unit 2.4, with the following agreed as part of our
Strategy and Business Plan:

Increase the number of Apprentices undertaking the Level 3 programme to 140

Convert the majority of our Commercial HE on to Level 4 Apprenticeship programs.

We are still considering an increase to the number of leamers in academic sessions from 12-16.

Continue to grow and improve our commercial offering, which has shown very positive growth in 2022/23

tdentify new income opportunities such as delivering more commercial academic courses such as CAD-Computer

aided design, Abrasive wheels.

Consideration te evening delivery to support commercial training around welding and electrical safety

Forest of Dean GET site now operational, and we are 18 months into our 10-year lease and presently have 19 Year 1 Level
3 apprentices.

Public Benefit
The trustees confirm that they have complied with the duty set out in section 4 of the Charities Act 2011, to have due regard
to the public benefit guidance published by the Charity Commission.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT TO THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF GLOUCESTERSHIRE
ENGINEERING TRAINING LIMITED

For the year ended 31 August 2024

Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of Gloucestershire Engineering Training Limited (the ‘charitable company’) for
the year ended 31 August 2024 which comprise the statement of financial activities, balance sheet, statement of cash flows
and the related notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. The financial
reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards,
including Financial Reporting Standard 102: The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of treland
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

In our opinion, the financial statements:

* give a true and fair view of the state of the charitable company's affairs as at 31 August 2024 and of its incoming
resources and application of resources, including its income and expenditure, for the year then ended.

+ have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and

+ have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (fSAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our
fesponsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial
statements section of our report. We are independent of the charitable company in accordance with the ethical
requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard, and
we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence
we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Conclusions relating to going concern
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the Trustees’ use of the going concern basis of accounting i in.

the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions
that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the charitable company’s ability to continue as a going
concern for 2 period of at least twelve months from when the original financial statements were authorised for issue.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the trustees with respect to going concern are described in the relevant
sections of this report.

Other information .
The trustees are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the

annual report other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements
does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express
any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so,
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements, or our knowledge obtained
in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material
misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a
material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a
material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.

Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

+ the information given in the Trustees’ Report, which includes the Directors’ Report prepared for the purposes of
company law for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial

Statements; and
* the Directors’ Report included within the Trustees’ Report has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal

requirements.

GLOUCESTERSHIRE ENGINEERING TRAINING LIMITED (By Guarantee)

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT TO THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF GLOUCESTERSHIRE
ENGINEERING TRAINING LIMITED

For the year ended 31 August 2024

Matters on which we are required to report by exception

In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the charitable company and its environment obtained in the course of
the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the Directors Report included in the Trustees’ Report. We have
Nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to
you if, in our opinion:

* adequate accounting records have not been kept or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from
branches not visited by us;

* _ the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns;

* — certain disclosures of trustees’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or

* we have not received ail the information and explanations necessary for the purposes of our audit.

Responsibilities of Trustees

The Trustees are responsible for the other information. As explained more fully in the Board of Govemor’s Responsibilities
statement set out on page 8 the Trustees (who are aiso the Directors of the company for the purposes of company law)
are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view,
and for such internal control as the Trustees determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the Trustees are responsible for assessing the Charitable Company's ability to
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis
of accounting unless the Trustees either intend to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic
attemative but to do so.

Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will
always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users
taken on the basis of these financial statements.

Extent to which the audit was capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud

(regularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line
with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The
extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below:

We considered the nature of the charitable company's industry and its control environment and reviewed the charitable
company’s documentation of their policies and procedures relating to fraud and compliance with laws and regulations. We
also enquired of management about their own identification and assessment of the risks of irregularities.

We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory framework that the company operates in and identified the key
laws and regulations that had a direct effect on the determination of material amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, including the UK Companies Act, UK Charities Act, Charity SORP, Independent Training Providers Handbook
and tax legislation, and, those that do not have a direct effect on the financial statements but compliance with which may
be fundamental to the charitable company's ability to operate or to avoid a material penalty.

We discussed among the audit engagement team regarding the opportunities and incentives that may exist within the
organisation for fraud and how and where fraud might occur in the financial statements.

In common with all audits under ISAs (UK), we are also required to perform specific procedures to respond to the risk of
Management override. In addressing the risk of fraud through management override of controls, we tested the

* appropriateness of journal entries and other adjustments; assessed whether the judgments made in accounting estimates
are indicative of a potential bias; and evaluated the business rationale of any significant transactions that are unusual or
outside the normal course of business. :

In addition to the above, our procedures to respond to the risks identified included the following:

* reviewing financial statement disclosures by testing to supporting documentation to assess compliance with
provisions of relevant laws and regulations described as having a direct effect on the financial statements;

* performing analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships that may indicate risks of
material misstatements due to fraud;

+ enquiring of management concerning actual and potential litigation and claims and instances of non-compliance
with laws and regulations; and

+ — reading minutes of meetings of those charged with govemance.

GLOUCESTERSHIRE ENGINEERING TRAINING LIMITED (By Guarantee)

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT TO THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF GLOUCESTERSHIRE
ENGINEERING TRAINING LIMITED

For the year ended 31 August 2024

‘Our audit procedures were designed to respond to risks of material misstatement in the financial statements, recognising
that the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from
error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery, misrepresentations or through collusion. There
are inherent limitations in the audit procedures performed and the further removed non-compliance with laws and
regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely we are to become aware

GLOUCESTERSHIRE ENGINEERING TRAINING LIMITED (By Guarantee)
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the year ended 31 August 2024

1. GENERAL INFORMATION

The company is a private Charitable Company limited by guarantee, registered in England and Wales.

The address of its registered office is:
Barnwood Point

Corinium Avenue

Gloucester

GL4 3HX

2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Statement of compliance

The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Accounting and Reporting by Charities: Statement of
Recommended Practice applicable to charities preparing their accounts in accordance with the Financial Reporting Standard
applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland (FRS 102) — (Charities SORP (FRS102)), the Financial Reporting Standard
applicable in the UK and Republic of treland (FRS 102), the Companies Act 2006 and the Charities Act 2011.

Basis of preparation
The presentational currency of the financial statements is Pound Sterling, being the functional currency of the primary

economic environment in which the Charitable Company operates. Monetary amounts in these financial statements are
rounded to the nearest Pound.

Gloucestershire Engineering Training Limited meets the definition of a public benefit entity under FRS 102.

Assets and liabilities are initially recognised at historical cost or transaction value unless otherwise stated in the relevant
accounting policy note(s).

Going Concern
The trustees assess whether the use of going concern is appropriate, i.e. whether there are any material uncertainties related

to events or conditions that may cast a significant doubt on the ability of the Charitable Company to continue as a going
concern. The trustees’ make this assessment in respect of a period of at least one year from the date of approval of the
financial statements. In making this assessment the trustees review forecasts prepared and consider the position of the
Charitable Company at the date of signing the financial statements.

On review, the trustees’ have concluded that it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the
financial statements.

Format of Accounts
The Company is a registered charity and is not, therefore, a profit-making organisation. In the opinion of the Board of

Governors, references required by the Companies Act 2006 to profits are misleading in the context of the Charitable
Company’ 's activities and have therefore been substituted by the term surplus where appropriate.

The Charitable Company has no costs which are directly attributable to sales and is therefore unable to adopt any of the
statement of financial activities formats prescribed by the Companies Act 2006

Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty

In the application of the Charitable Company's accounting policies, the Trustees are required to make judgements, estimates
and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The
estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be

televant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision
and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

No judgements have been identified by management in preparing these financial statements.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the year ended 31 August 2024

2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

Key sources of estimation uncertainty have been identified by management in preparing these financial statements as
follows:

Shortfall deposits
The Charitable Company report shortfall deposits of £1,032,468 (2023: £1,159,178) on the balance sheet aged with regard
to management's best estimate of the expected repayment periods of the shortfall deposits.

The discounting element is considered immaterial and therefore no adjustment has been made.

Dilapidation provision

A provision of £175,000 (2023: £175,000) is made in respect of costs that may be incurred at cessation of the property lease
in order to return the property to the same state as when the lease was entered into. This estimate is based on management's
review of dilapidation costs incurred on similar properties.

The discounting element is considered immaterial and therefore no adjustment has been made.

Accrued income
Accrued income of £2,512,335 (2023: £1,945,746) is recognised in respect of funding due to be received, as the Charitable
Company provides learner training, based on historical achievement rates of apprentices.

Incoming Resources

Incoming resources represent fees receivable for training services provided by the Charitable Company during the year and
is recognised once the charity has entitlement to the income, it is probable that the income will be received and the amount
of the income receivable can be measured reliably.

Grants receivable are recognised under the accrual model. They are held in creditors as deferred income until such time as
the Charitable Company can be reasonably certain that the funds can be taken as revenue, rather than being repaid to the
Government or passed on to sponsoring companies.

Government grants

Government grants are recognised based on the accruat model and are measured at the fair value of the asset received or
teceivable. Grants are classified as relating either to revenue or to assets. Grants relating to revenue are recognised in
income over the period in which the related costs are recognised. Grants relating to assets are recognised over the expected
useful life of the asset. Where part of a grant relating to an asset is deferred, it is recognised as deferred income.

Intangible Fixed Assets
Software development costs are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date and have a finite useful life and are carried
at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.

Amortisation
Amortisation is calculated to write off the cost of intangible assets, less any estimated residual value, over their useful life as
follows:

Software development costs 20% of cost per annum

Tangible Fixed Assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated in the balance sheet at cost less depreciation.

Depreciation .

Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost of tangible assets over their estimated useful lives at the following rates:
Improvements to leasehold property Over 10 years
Plant and equipment 10%-33% of cost per annum
Motor vehicles 20% of cost per annum

Cash and cash equivatents.

Cash is represented by cash in hand and deposits with financial institutions repayable without penalty on notice of not more
than 24 hours. Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments that mature in no more than one month from the date of
acquisition and that are readily convertible to know amounts of cash with insignificant risk of change in value.

2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

Trade debtors .
Trade debtors are amounts due from customers for services performed in the ordinary course of business.

Trade debtors are recognised initially at the transaction price. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the
effective interest methad, less provision for impairment. A provision for the impairment of trade debtors is established when
there is objective evidence that the Charitable Company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original

terms of the receivables.

Trade creditors
Trade creditors are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from

suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if the charity does not have an unconditional right, at the end
of the reporting period, to defer settlement of the creditor for at least twelve months after the reporting date. If there is an
unconditional right to defer settlement for at least twelve months after the reporting date, they are presented as non-current
liabilities.

Trade creditors are recognised initially at the transaction price and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the
effective interest method.

Borrowings
interest-bearing borrowings are initially recorded at fair value, net of transaction costs. Interest-bearing borrowings are

subsequently carried at amortised cost, with the difference between the proceeds, net of transaction costs, and the amount
due on redemption being recognised as a charge to the Statement of Financial Activity over the period of the relevant

borrowing.

Interest expense is recognised on the basis of the effective interest method and is included within Other Costs.

Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Charitable Company has an unconditional right to defer settlement
of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting date.

Operating Leases
The cost of operating leases has been charged to the statement of financial activities on a straight-line basis over the term

of the term.

Hire Purchase
Assets acquired under hire purchase have been recorded in the balance sheet as tangible fixed assets at their equivatent

capital value. The corresponding liability has been included under creditors due within or after one year. The interest element
is charged to the statement of financial activities and represents a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments

outstanding.

Resources Expended
All expenditure is accounted for under the accruals concept. The Charitable Company has only one main activity: the

provision of training services. All costs, other than professional fees are allocated to the main charitable activity. Within the
main charitable activity, costs are allocated across Practical, Academic and Assessment costs. These allocations are based
on direct apportionment except for premises costs, which are allocated on approximate floor space and usage. Professional

fees are allocated to governance costs.

Fund structure
Unrestricted income funds are general funds that are available for use at the Trustees discretion in furtherance of the

objectives of the charity.

Pensions .
Contributions payable on behalf of employees to the defined contribution pension scheme are charged to the statement of

financial activities as they become payable in accordance with the rules of the scheme.

Financia! Instruments
The Charitable Company only has financial assets and financial liabilities of a kind that qualify as basic financial instruments.

Basic financial instruments are initially recognised at transaction value and subsequently measured at their settlement value.

Reclassification of comparative amounts
Prior year income in relation to the write-offs of shortfall deposits have been reclassified to income from charitable activities

as other income, as they are considered to be in the usual course of business. The reclassification has had no impact on
the comparative results for the year or brought forward capital and reserves for the current year.
