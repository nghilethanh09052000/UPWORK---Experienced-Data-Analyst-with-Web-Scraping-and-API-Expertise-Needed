For the year ended 31 July 2024

General Information

SR Supply Chain Consultants Ltd is a private company, limited by shares, registered
in England and Wales, registration number 06396769, registration address Parkside
House, 190-192 Wigan Road, Euxton, PR7 6JW.

1. Accounting policies

Significant accounting policies

The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in
accordance with FRS 102, the Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK
and Republic of Ireland (as applied to small entities by Section 1A of the
standard)

Turnover

Turnover comprises the invoiced value of goods and services supplied by the
company, net of Value Added Tax and trade discounts.

Government grants

Government grants received are credited to deferred income. Grants towards
capital expenditure are released to the income statement over the expected
useful life of the assets. Grants received towards revenue expenditure are
released to the income statement as the related expenditure is incurred.

Website cost

Planning and operating costs for the company's website are charged to the
income statement as incurred.

Taxation

Taxation represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax. Tax is
recognised in the statement of income, except to the extent that it relates to items
recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in capital and reserves.
The company’s liability for current tax is calculated using the tax rates and laws
that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

Current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted

Deferred taxation

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated
but not reversed at the reporting date.

Deferred tax is measured using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the reporting date that are expected to apply to the
reversal of the timing difference.

Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised only to the
extent that it is probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of
deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.

Current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.

Tangible fixed assets

Tangible fixed assets, other than freehold land, are stated at cost or valuation
less depreciation and any provision for impairment. Depreciation is provided at
rates calculated to write off the cost or valuation of fixed assets, less their
estimated residual value, over their expected useful lives on the following basis:

Plant and Machinery 25% Reducing Balance
Fixtures and Fittings 25% Reducing Balance
Computer Equipment 25% Reducing Balance
Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the company has a present obligation as a result
of a past event which it is more probable than not will result in an outflow of
economic benefits that can be reasonably estimated.

Preference shares

The company's preference shares are treated as a financial liability since they are
subject to mandatory redemption for a fixed or determinable amount at a fixed or
determinable time and are thus included in creditors in the statement of financial
position rather than as part of the company's issued share capital.

. Average number of employees

Average number of employees during the year was 33 (2023 : 26).
