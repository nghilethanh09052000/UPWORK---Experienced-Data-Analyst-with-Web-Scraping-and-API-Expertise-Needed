2 Accounting policies

Summary of significant accounting policies and key accounting estimates

The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These
policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.

Statement of compliance

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102 Section 1A
smaller entities - 'The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland’ and the
Companies Act 2006 (as applicable to companies subject to the small companies’ regime).

Basis of preparation

These financial statements have been prepared using the historical cost convention except that as disclosed in the
accounting policies certain items are shown at fair value.

Group accounts not prepared

The company is part of a small group. The company has taken advantage of the exemption provided by Section 398
of the Companies Act 2006 and has not prepared group accounts.

Revenue recognition

Turnover comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and provision of
services in the ordinary course of the company’s activities. Turnover is shown net of sales/value added tax, returns,
rebates and discounts.

The company recognises revenue when:

The amount of revenue can be reliably measured;

it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity;

and specific criteria have been met for each of the company's activities.

Tax
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in profit or loss, except that a

change attributable to an item of income or expense recognised as other comprehensive income is also recognised
directly in other comprehensive income.

Notes to the Unaudited Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 August 2023

The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of tax rates and laws that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the reporting date in the countries where the company operates and generates taxable
income.

Deferred income tax is recognised on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and
their carrying amounts in the financial statements and on unused tax losses or tax credits in the company. Deferred
income tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting
date.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and a valuation allowance is set up
against deferred tax assets so that the net carrying amount equals the highest amount that is more likely than not to
be recovered based on current or future taxable profit.

Tangible assets

Tangible assets are stated in the balance sheet at cost, less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and
subsequent accumulated impairment losses.
The cost of tangible assets includes directly attributable incremental costs incurred in their acquisition and installation.

Depreciation

Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than land and properties under construction over
their estimated useful lives, as follows:

Asset class Depreciation method and rate
Fixtures and fittings 15% reducing balance basis
Motor vehicles 25% reducing balance basis
Office equipment 25%/50% reducing balance basis
Short leasehold Over 10 year life of the lease

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and call deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments
that are readily convertible to a Known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value.

Trade debtors

Trade debtors are amounts due from customers for merchandise sold or services performed in the ordinary course of
business.

Trade debtors are recognised initially at the transaction price. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost
using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. A provision for the impairment of trade debtors is
established when there is objective evidence that the company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to
the original terms of the receivables.

Notes to the Unaudited Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 August 2023

Stocks

Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell. Cost is determined
using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.

The cost of finished goods and work in progress comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs
and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. At
each reporting date, stocks are assessed for impairment. If stocks are impaired, the carrying amount is reduced to its
selling price less costs to complete and sell; the impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.

Trade creditors

Trade creditors are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of
business from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if the company does not have an
unconditional right, at the end of the reporting period, to defer settlement of the creditor for at least twelve months
after the reporting date. If there is an unconditional right to defer settlement for at least twelve months after the
reporting date, they are presented as non-current liabilities.

Trade creditors are recognised initially at the transaction price and subsequently measured at amortised cost using
the effective interest method.

Leases

Leases in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as
operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the
period of the lease.

Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and
rewards of ownership to the lessee.

Assets held under finance leases are recognised at the lower of their fair value at inception of the lease and the
present value of the minimum lease payments. These assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter
of the useful life of the asset and the lease term. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance
sheet as a finance lease obligation.

Hire purchase contracts are capitalised in the balance sheet and are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term
and the asset’s useful lives. A corresponding liability is recognised for the lease payments.

Lease payments are apportioned between finance costs in the profit and loss account and reduction of the lease
obligation so as to achieve a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.

Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Equity instruments are measured at the fair value of the cash or other

resources received or receivable, net of the direct costs of issuing the equity instruments. If payment is deferred and
the time value of money is material, the initial measurement is on a present value basis.

Dividends

Dividend distribution to the company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the
reporting period in which the dividends are declared.

Defined contribution pension obligation

A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which fixed contributions are paid into a pension fund and the
company has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions even if the fund does not hold sufficient
assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.

Contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as employee benefit expense when they are due. If
contribution payments exceed the contribution due for service, the excess is recognised as a prepayment.

3 Staff numbers

The average number of persons employed by the company (including directors) during the year, was 35 (2022 - 42).
