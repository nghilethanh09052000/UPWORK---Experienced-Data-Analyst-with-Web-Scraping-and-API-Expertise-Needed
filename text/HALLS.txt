STATUTORY INFORMATION

Halls Of lvy Beauty Academy Limited is a private company, limited by shares , registered in England and
Wales. The company's registered number and registered office address can be found on the Company
Information page.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of preparing the financial statements

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102
"The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland" including the provisions
of Section 1A "Small Entities" and the Companies Act 2006. The financial statements have been prepared
under the historical cost convention.

Turnover
Turnover is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, excluding discounts,
rebates, value added tax and other sales taxes.

Tangible fixed assets
Depreciation is provided at the following annual rates in order to write off each asset over its estimated
useful life.

Stocks
Stocks and work in progress are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value, after making due
allowance for obsolete and slow moving items.

Cost is calculated using the first-in, first-out method and includes all purchase, transport, and handling
costs in bringing stocks to their present location and condition.

Taxation
Taxation for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Income Statement,
except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.

Current or deferred taxation assets and liabilities are not discounted.

Current tax is recognised at the amount of tax payable using the tax rates and laws that have been
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.

Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the
balance sheet date.

Timing differences arise from the inclusion of income and expenses in tax assessments in periods
different from those in which they are recognised in financial statements. Deferred tax is measured using
tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the year end and that are
expected to apply to the reversal of the timing difference.

Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable
that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.
