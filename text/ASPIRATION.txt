1.3

Aspiration Training Limited (the company’) is a limited liability company incorporated and domiciled
in the United Kingdom. The address of its registered office is disclosed on the company information

page.

The financial statements are prepared in Sterling (£), which is the functional currency of the
company. The financial statements are for the year ended 31 July 2024 (2023: year ended 31 July
2023).

Basis of preparation of financial statements

The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost
convention and in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102 (FRS 102), the Financial
Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and the Republic of Ireland, including section 1A of FRS
102, and the Companies Act 2006.

The company and group is small and is exempt from the requirement to prepare group accounts by
virtue of section 398 of the Companies Act 2006. These financial statements therefore present
information about the company as an individual undertaking and not about its group.

The following accounting policies have been applied:

Going concern

At the balance sheet date the Aspiration Training group of which the company is part, had a strong
cash balance and significant net current asset resources amounting to £2,093,782. The directors
have prepared detailed forecasts of trading and cash flow for a period of at least 12 months from the
date of approving these financial statements which indicate that the group has sufficient resources to
meet its financial obligations as they fall due.

On that basis, the directors have prepared these financial statements on a going concern basis.
Turnover

Turnover comprises revenue recognised by the company in respect of services supplied during the
year exclusive of Value Added Tax and trade discounts.

The company turnover is wholly attributable to management charges received from its subsidiaries.

Tangible fixed assets

Tangible fixed assets under the cost model are stated at historical cost less accumulated
depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Historical cost includes expenditure that is
directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable
of operating in the manner intended by management.

The company adds to the carrying amount of an item of fixed assets the cost of replacing part of
such an item when that cost is incurred, if the replacement part is expected to provide incremental
future benefits to the company. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. Repairs
and maintenance are charged to the profit and loss account during the period in which they are
incurred.

Depreciation is charged so as to allocate the cost of assets less their residual value over their
estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method.

Fixtures, fittings and equipment - 20% - 33%

The assets' residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted
prospectively if appropriate, or if there is an indication of a significant change since the last reporting
date.

Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount
and are recognised in the profit and loss account.

At each balance sheet date, the company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible fixed assets to
determine whether there is any indication that any items have suffered an impairment loss. If any
such indication exists, the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated in order to determine the
extent of the impairment loss, if any. Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of
the asset, the company estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the
asset belongs.

If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying
amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount. Any impairment loss is recognised as an
expense immediately in the profit and loss account.

Investments

Investments held as fixed assets are initially measured at cost and reviewed annually for signs of
impairment. If any loss is identified this is recognised immediately in the profit and loss account and
the value of the investment is reduced accordingly.

Provisions for liabilities

Provisions are made where an event has taken place that gives the company a legal or constructive
obligation that probably requires settlement by a transfer of economic benefit, and a reliable estimate
can be made of the amount of the obligation.

Provisions are charged as an expense to the profit and loss account in the year that the company
becomes aware of the obligation, and are measured at the best estimate at the balance sheet date
of the expenditure required to settle the obligation, taking into account relevant risks and
uncertainties.

When payments are eventually made, they are charged to the provision carried in the balance sheet.

Financial instruments

The company only enters into basic financial instrument transactions that result in the recognition of
financial assets and liabilities such as trade and other debtors and creditors and loans with related
parties.

All financial assets and liabilities are intitally measured at transaction price and subsequently
measured at amortised cost.

For financial assets measured at cost less impairment, the impairment loss is measured as the
difference between an asset's carrying amount and best estimate of the recoverable amount, which
is an approximation of the amount that the company would receive for the asset if it were to be sold
at the balance sheet date.

Operating leases

Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line
basis over the lease term.

Pensions

The company operates a defined contribution plan for its employees. A defined contribution plan is a
pension plan under which the company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. Once the
contributions have been paid the company has no further payment obligations.

The contributions are recognised as an expense in the profit and loss account when they fall due.
Amounts not paid are shown in accruals as a liability in the balance sheet. The assets of the plan are
held separately from the company in independently administered funds.

1.10 Dividends

Equity dividénds are recognised when they become legally payable. Interim equity dividends are
recognised when paid. Final equity dividends are recognised when approved.

1.11 Taxation

The tax charge comprises of current and deferred tax.

Current tax is recognised for the amount of corporation tax payable in respect of the taxable profit
for the current or past reporting periods using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the reporting date.

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of ail the timing differences at the reporting date, except as
otherwise indicated.

Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered
against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.

Deferred tax is calculated using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the reporting date that are expected to apply to the reversal of the timing differences.

Employees

The average monthly number of employees, including directors, during the year was 190 (2023: 184).
