STRATEGIC REPORT

STRUCTURE, GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT

GOVERNING DOCUMENT

The Group Training Association is a charitable Company Limited by Guarantee incorporated on the 30 April 1985 and
registered as a charity on 10 February 1987. The Company was established under a Memorandum of Association that
established the objects and powers of the charity and is governed under its Articles of Association. In the event of the
Group Training Association being wound up, members are required to contribute an amount not exceeding £10.

RECRUITMENT AND APPOINTMENT OF COUNCIL

The Directors of the Group Training Association are also Charity Trustees for the purpose of Charity Law and are also
known as Members of the Council. Under the requirements of the Memorandum & Articles of Association, the Members
of the Council are elected to serve until resignation.

Al! Council Members have direct links with the motor trade through their own business or by way of current or past
employment within the motor trade. Most Council Members have served the Group Training Association for a long
time, however, from time to time new members are elected who are known to have the interest of the Association at heart.
Given their in-depth knowledge of the industry, a specific training programme is not considered necessary, however, the
Chairman, the Group Training Manager and other Council Members assist any new members in understanding their
obligations and responsibilities under the Companies and Charities Acts.

ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE

The Organisational Structure of the Group Training Association is made up of a Board of Council Members elected from
the membership of the Company. The Council is responsible for the strategic direction and policy of the Group Training
Association. Structured monthly meetings are held to determine policy and procedures. The Executive Council
members meet every other month and there is a whole Council meeting in the intervening months. Meetings are minuted
by the Company Secretary and minutes are circulated to all members.

A scheme of delegation is in place and day to day responsibility for the provision of training services rests with the Group
Training Manager who attends council meetings but who does not have a vote. The Group Training Manager is
responsible for ensuring that the Company delivers the training services and ensuring that key performance indicators are
met. They are also responsible for the day to day operational management of the Company.

PAY POLICY FOR KEY STAFF

The Council consists of the board of trustees and the senior management team. The management team are the key
personnel of the charity in charge of directing and controlling, running and operating the charity on a day-to-day basis.
All trustees give their time freely and no trustee receives remuneration in the year.

The pay of the senior staff is reviewed annually along with other staff employed by the charity, usually with a percentage
increase relating to inflation and competition in the employee market for staff. Where pay for senior staff falls outside
that percentage increase, that would be reviewed and approved by the Board of Council Members.

The educational and training activities of the Group Training Association are managed by a total of twenty six staff (on
average) employed throughout the Training Association's two Centres and five departments.

STRUCTURE, GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT
APPRENTICES

The Group Training Association tendered for a Government funded contract with the Education and Skills Funding
Agency. This Government legislated contract has an important significance to the Group Training Association as it
accounts for over sixty percent of the course income funding. In June 2017 the Group Training Association was awarded
Government funding apprentice training contract for levy paying employers despite fierce competition from colleges and
other training organisations that operate on a national basis. The 'Register of Approved Training Providers' (RoATP) was
refreshed in December 2021, requiring all approved providers to re-apply under new, stricter conditions. The Group
Training Association was successful in its re-application. In 2023 the register was changed again to Apprenticeship
Provider Assessment Register (APAR) combining the RoATP and EPAO registers. The register has not re-opened since
for any new standard applications.

Since 2017 there have been continued changes to every part of an apprenticeship from the funding through to assessment
and qualifications. Implemented by the Education and Skills Funding Agency, Apprenticeship Frameworks were no
longer be funded from 31 July 2020 leaving only Apprenticeship Standards approved for Government funding. A
training levy was introduced for larger employers with over 250 employees and/or a payroll of over 3 miltion. There
were also changes to funding for medium to small employers. Standards are structured with an emphasis on end testing
for assessment of an apprentices competence. However the lack of available standards for some motor vehicle
Specialisms ie: Paint, Panel, Heavy Vehicle Level 2 and Auto-Electrical means we are unable currently to recruit
apprentices for some of these disciplines. This is having a negative impact on the recruitment of apprentices, and
subsequently income, of the Group Training Association.

The training programme's success is measured by the number of Learners on programme and the attainment of Standards
achieved in their respective career specialism. The targets are challenging and, due to the continuing difficult trading
that garages are experiencing combined with the impact of the pandemic and now the reduction in approved
apprenticeship standards for the motor industry, there is a reduced uptake in apprentice work placements that is affecting
apprentice numbers on our training programme which can take up to 3 years to show statistically. The Qualification
Award Bodies inspection regime (IMI, OCR, SQA, EDI, RTITB, JAUPT, SEG and City & Guilds) audit all Group
Training Association qualification systems and procedures in order to grant their approval to provide a full qualification
structure for the students. :

A Group Training Association Management Team will complete quality audits and assessments to identify and address
any concerns.

The Group Training Association opened a Training Centre in Sheffield in September 2007 to enable it to take up a contract
with Sheffield LEA to deliver motor vehicle vocational programmes for schools in the Sheffield region. GTA have not
re-contracted with Sheffield LEA for the full 2023/2024 academic year and the Alternative Provision Programme with
them ended December 2023. The Group Training Association also has thirty apprentices following their training
programmes at the Sheffield Centre.

We have also continued to invest in equipment to operate various IMI qualifications and End Point Assessment activities,
including Service Technician, Vehicle Air Conditioning, Vehicle Inspection and Vehicle Refinishing from our Doncaster
Centre.

The Group Training Association continues its relationship with motor vehicle manufacturers and is presently involved
with Vertex Professional Services representing Honda and on a temporary basis BOSCH and Renault. Depending upon
car sates and market share the manufacturers increase or decrease the amount of work carried out by the Group Training
Association.

OTHER TRAINING PROGRAMMES

In August 2016 the Group Training Association took the decision to apply for direct approval and to produce all of its
own training material for Driver Certificate of Competence (Driver CPC). This has been successfully carried out and
the Group Training Association has direct approval to operate the Driver CPC courses via DVSA. Ten days of courses
were re-approved in August 2024.

REPORT OF THE COUNCIL
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2024

STRUCTURE, GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT

SAFEGUARDING, PREVENT & BRITISH VALUES

The GTA considers that employee and learner involvement is essential to its continuing success and uses a variety of
methods to inform, consult and involve employees and learners. These include questionnaires, meetings, Every Child
Matters, Prevent Duties, Safeguarding, British Values, Radicalisation Awareness and E-safety. The Group Training
Association has an appointed Safeguarding Lead and Deputy responsible for all Equality, Diversity, Prevent and
Safeguarding.

All staff and apprentices under-take Safeguarding and Prevent training, all staff are subject to DBS checks.

RISK MANAGEMENT
The Council confirms that systems have been established to identify any major risks to which the Company may be
exposed and the perceived risks are reviewed monthly to mitigate these risks.

A Treasurer's report is presented as a fixed and formal agenda item at the Council's bi-monthly meetings. Funds held
for investment are confirmed at this meeting. An annual review of Internal Financial Controls using the Charity
Commission self-checklist is carried out and evaluated against guidelines.

The Council continues to review spending and investment policies

The organisation still has a clear focus on extending the geographical area that the Company operates in to increase the
amount of business into the company. The option to purchase Unit 3 Rands Lane in September 2023 in Doncaster was
executed and involved substantial capital expenditure to be sourced from the organisations own funds.

Staff numbers are currently stable, however, this will continue to be reviewed in 2024/2025 in line with ESFA income.

The council have also explored the utilisation of the GTA's assets and in-particular buildings and property. The funds
raised from the leasing property is expected to be reinvested into the apprentice programme, providing much needed
financiaj stability at a time where the biggest changes in apprenticeships have been made since the introduction of the
Modern Apprenticeship which started in the early 1990's.

The investment policy for surplus monies was reviewed in 201] and an account was opened with Lloyds Bank that has
produced improved interest rates for deposits. These interest rates from Lloyds have now reduced and are closer to the
rates offered by Barclays. The Council maintains a substantial reserve of monies to minimise possible cash flow
problems due to the economic climate. The reserves allow for changes in Apprenticeship funding and the substantial
increase in the delivery of services due to the rapid increase in inflation.

MAIN RISKS

The continued changes to the apprenticeship structure and ESFA funding system through 2022/2023 may have an impact
on achievement rates, apprentice recruitment and financial income. Employers now have to adjust to using the
Apprenticeship Service (AS) to direct Government funding to the GTA for their apprenticeship training.

The introduction of the apprenticeship Standards and Frameworks no longer being funded has created extra burdens on
employers which previously did not exist. Employers are now responsible for funding setup and allocations for
apprenticeships. This is proving more problematic for smaller employers who do not necessarily have the time or
resource to perform these processes. This has consequently increased the load on the GTA who have provided more
staff time allocated to guiding and supporting employers.

With the increase in the school leaving age schools are encouraging learmers to stay in school rather than take up an
apprenticeship. This has ted to schools starting to set up their own motor vehicle workshops to keep vocational training
within the school premises.

REPORT OF THE COUNCIL
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2024

STRUCTURE, GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT
Due to the Government's Spending Review limiting the budgets of schools and changes to the qualification points systems,
in 2014 there was approximately 3,000 approved courses by Ofqual, there are now between 200-300.

In order to reduce the risk to income and expenditure the Group Training Association:-

- Monitors the ESFA contract progression on a monthly basis in order to ensure that it is delivering against
contract requirements.

- Employs staff in a specific marketing role to engage apprentice placement companies in order to maintain
and if possible increase apprentice numbers.

- Has expanded the geographical area that it operates in for apprenticeships.

- Has continued to contain costs associated with the companies operation whilst income has reduced.

- Has a renewed focus on the company’s electronic systems and social media for marketing purposes.

- Continues to monitor the motor and logistics sector for changes manufactures trends, advancing
technologies, changes in government legislation and public opinion. °

Another risk to the GTA's operations is the government's drive to promote electric cars. This will have a major impact
on the motor trade and in particular, the demand for apprenticeships and the nature of the training provided. The GTA
is well placed to provide the relevant training but the impact on the number of apprenticeships is as yet unclear. As a
result, the GTA is looking to increase the range of courses offered for persons "employed or intending to be employed in
such other activities as may benefit from the training services provided by the Association” (to quote from the GTA's
charitable objects).

FUTURE CENTRE DEVELOPMENTS AND OBJECTIVES 2024/2025
- Continue placement marketing in an effort to expand apprentice contract numbers
To expand the operation area for the apprenticeship programme to include all of South Yorkshire and the
- Sheffield City Region .
- To maintain apprenticeship success rates at, or above, KPI's
Invest in training facilities and equipment to be more in line with the latest technological developments in
- the sector
- Monitor Government directives on proposed changes to programmes
- To uphold the staff development programme
- Provide facilities and support for all Manufacturers' courses

We are continuing to modify our training course portfolio and build our existing dedicated educational resources to meet
new demands. Change is not only about investments in bricks and mortar. It must be people led and owned. Our
Group Training Association recognises the support that it must provide to be at the heart of future ambitions of our
learners.

FINANCIAL REVIEW

During the year under review incoming resources have exceeded expended resources, creating a surplus of £122,101,
compared to a deficit of £115,147 in 2023. Total income has risen in the year by £262,967 and, expenditure has increased
by £25,719, to give the increase in overall performance of £237,248. The Council is carefully monitoring projected
income and expenditure levels to ensure that the GTA continues to have a financially viable operation. It should be
noted that there is a surplus before depreciation of £250,427 compared to a deficit of £14,003 in 2023.

RESERVES POLICY

The Group Training Association reserves at the year-end are represented by the accumulated fund of £5,407,987 (2023 -
£5,285,886) shown on the balance sheet. Of this amount, £4,175,463 (2023 - £3,671,558) is represented by the
Company's fixed assets, investment and working capital. The Group Training Association free reserves are represented
by cash held at the bank amounting to £1,307,034 (2023 - £1,614,328). The free reserves are held at this level because
the Council are particularly mindful of the operating costs of Motor Vehicle Training Workshops and in particular the
promotion of a safe environment for training in vehicle body repair and paint operations, not to mention unforeseen
circumstances.

The level of free reserves therefore held and available to be applied to the council's discretion in furtherance of the
Charity's objects, is determined by reference to the specific requirements for capital and refurbishment expenditure in the
short and medium term together with contingency plans to meet any urgent Training Centre financial requirements and
contingencies. In particular, the Council are considering:

(a) Upgrading/modemising the Training Centre.
(b) Large capital spend for equipment needed to upgrade Unit 2 Rands Lane in relation to the lease for Inspiro (BMW,
VW and JLR Group) commencing October 2024.

It is the prudent purchase and construction of property from past surpluses which has created a sound financial basis for
the GTA, since otherwise there would be a large exposure to rental liabilities. It is also considered that the level of free
reserves is necessary to cover any deficits that may arise in the future from a loss of revenue arising from companies or
other institutions cutting back their training programmes, as noted in the "Main Risk" section of this report. The
downturn in income in certain past years demonstrates that this is not a theoretical risk.

As we continue to be unaware of what is " round the corner” the level of reserves held by the GTA does mean that the
GTA should be able to deal with any unforeseen liabilities that might arise in the future.

INVESTMENT POLICY

Short-term funds are principally invested on the money markets, with other monies being held in bank deposits. The
potential risks in the Stock Market were recognised by the Council in October 2007 when the Council decided to liquidate
its investment portfolio with Barclays Bank Ple. Since then, the company has only invested in bank and money market
deposits. When interest rates were high, this produced a good return for the GTA but the continuing decrease in interest
rates has meant that the company's income from interest has continued to decrease over the years, to what is now a very
low figure in relation to the amounts held. Current deposits are held with Barclays Bank Ple and Lloyds Bank Plc.

If these banks decide to stop paying interest, the Council will have to consider alternative institutions if it is to obtain
investment income in the future. The Group Training Association invites Barclays Bank Plc (with whom it has a forty
year history of banking) and Lloyds Bank Pic to its Annual General Meeting to discuss longer term investment funds
along with the Auditors.

At the Annual General Meeting, Senior Bank personnel attend are invited from the Council together with the Auditor,
who is asked to present the Annual accounts and make comment. These valued observations and advice are implemented
by the Council at the meeting following the Annual General Meeting and throughout the financial year.

accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and
United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

In our opinion the financial statements:

- givea true and fair view of the state of the charitable company's affairs as at 31 July 2024 and of its incoming resources
and application of resources, including its income and expenditure, for the year then ended;

- have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and

- have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with Intemational Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law.
Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the
financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the charitable company in accordance with the ethical
requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard,
and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Conclusions relating to going concern
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the trustees’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in
the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions
that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the charitable company's ability to continue as a going
concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the council members with respect to going concern are described in the
relevant sections of this report.

Other information
The council members are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included
in the Annual Report, other than the financial statements and our Report of the Independent Auditors thereon.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly
stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing
so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge
obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or
apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the
financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material
misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

- the information given in the Report of the Council for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared
is consistent with the financial statements; and

- the Report of the Council has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the charitable company and its environment obtained in the course of
the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the Report of the Council.

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you

if, in our opinion:

- adequate accounting records have not been kept or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches
not visited by us; or

- the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or

- certain disclosures of trustees’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or

- we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

Responsibilities of council members

As explained more fully in the Statement of Council Members' Responsibilities, the council members (who are also the
directors of the charitable company for the purposes of company law) are responsible for the preparation of the financial
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the council members
determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether
due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the council members are responsible for assessing the charitable company's ability
to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern
basis of accounting unless the council members either intend to liquidate the charitable company or to cease operations,
or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

REPORT OF THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS TO THE MEMBERS OF
DONCASTER ROTHERHAM AND DISTRICT MOTOR
TRADES GROUP TRAINING ASSOCIATION
LIMITED

Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue a Report of the Independent Auditors that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs
(UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic
decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below:

Based on our understanding of the Company, we identified that the principal risks of non-compliance with laws and
regulations related to corporation tax legislation and we considered the extent to which non-compliance might have a
material effect on the financial statements.

As part of this assessment we considered both quantitative and qualitative factors. We also considered those laws and
regulations that have a direct impact on the preparation of the financial statements, such as the Companies Act 2006 and
FRS 102.

We evaluated management's incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the financial statements which
included the risk of management override of controls. We determined that the principal risks were related to posting
inappropriate journal entries, omitting, advancing or delaying recognition of events and transactions that have occurred
during or after the reporting period, and potential management bias in the determination of accounting estimates or
judgements to manipulate results.

Audit procedures performed by the engagement team include:

- Enquiring of and obtaining written representation from management in relation to known or suspected
instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations and fraud;

-  Enquiring of entity staff in tax and compliance functions to identify any instances of non-compliance with
laws and regulations;

- Evaluation of management's controls designed to prevent and detect irregularities;

- Identifying and, where relevant, testing journal entries posted by senior management or with unusual
combinations;

- Assessing and evaluating the business rationale of significant transactions outside the normal course of
business;

- Reviewing financial statement disclosures and testing to supporting documentation to assess compliance with
applicable laws and regulations;

- Review of correspondence with regulators in so far as they are related to the financial statements;

- Incorporating elements of unpredictability into the nature, timing and/or extent of audit procedures performed.

There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above and the further removed non-compliance with laws
and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely we would become
aware of it. Also, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one
resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional
misrepresentation, or through collusion.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting
Council's website at www. fre.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our Report of the Independent
Auditors.
