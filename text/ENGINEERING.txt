ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of preparing the financial statements

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102 "The Financial
Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland” including the provisions of Section 1A "Small Entities"
and the Companies Act 2006. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.

The disclosure requirements of section 1A of FRS 102 have been applied other than where additional disclosure is required to
show a true and fair view.

The financial statements are prepared in sterling, which is the functional currency of the company. Monetary amounts in
these financial statements are rounded to the nearest £.

Going concern

The directors consider that there are no material uncertainties about the company's ability to continue as a going concern.
They have reviewed the financial position in conjunction with reserve levels and consider them adequate to meet future
operational commitments.

Turnover
Turnover is stated net of VAT and trade discounts, and represents the amounts derived from the provision of services from
operations in the UK, which fall within the company's ordinary activities.

Training revenue is recognised in the period the service is provided. Where payments are received from customers in advance
of services provided, the amounts are recorded as deferred income and included as part of creditors due within one year.

Other income represents a license fee for the use of the company’s training facilities.

Tangible fixed assets

Tangible fixed assets are initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost or valuation, net of depreciation and
any impairment losses.

Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over their useful lives on
the following bases:

Leasehold improvements Straight line over the life of the lease
Plant & Machinery 15% Reducing balance

Fixtures, fittings & equipment 15% Straight line

Office and computer equipment 25% Straight linc

The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying
value of the asset, and is credited or charged to profit or loss.

Financial instruments
The company has elected to apply the provisions of Section 11 'Basic Financial Instruments' and Section 12 ‘Other Financial
Instruments Issues' of FRS 102 to all of its financial instruments.

Financial instruments are recognised in the company's balance sheet when the company becomes party to the contractual
provisions of the instrument.

Financial assets and liabilities are offset, with the net amounts presented in the financial statements. when there is a legally
enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and

settle the liability simultaneously.

Basic financial assets

ENGINEERING TRUST TRAINING LIMITED (REGISTERED NUMBER: 02423523)

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - continued

“FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2024.
Basic financial assets, which include debtors and cash and bank balances, are initially measured at transaction price including
transaction costs and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method unless the arrangement
constitutes a financing transaction, where the transaction is measured at the present value of the future receipts discounted at
a market rate of interest. Financial assets classified as receivable within one year are not amortised.

Classification of financial liabilities

Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered
into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the company after deducting all of
its liabilities.

Basic financial liabilities

Basic financial liabilities. including creditors, bank loans, loans from fellow group companies and preference shares that are
classified as debt, are initially recognised at transaction price unless the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction,
where the debt instrument is measured at the present value of the future payments discounted at a market rate of interest.
Financial liabilitics classified as payable within onc year are not amortised.

Debt instruments are subsequently carried at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.

Trade creditors are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from
suppliers. Amounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less. If not, they are
presented as non-current liabilities. Trade creditors are recognised initially at transaction price and subsequently measured at
amortised cost using the effective interest method.

Derecognition of financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the trusts’ contractual obligations expire or are discharged or cancelled.

Government grants
Grants are accounted for on a received basis. Grants for capital items are credited to the cost of the fixed asset.

Taxation
Taxation for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Income Statement, except to the extent that
it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.

Current or deferred taxation assets and liabilities are not discounted.

Current tax is recognised at the amount of tax payable using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the balance sheet date.

Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date.

Timing differences arise from the inclusion of income and expenses in tax assessments in periods different from those in
which they are recognised in financial statements. Deferred tax is measured using tax rates and laws that have been enacted
or substantively enacted by the year end and that are expected to apply to the reversal of the timing difference.

Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that they will be
recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.

Hire purchase and leasing commitments

Assets obtained under hire purchase contracts or finance leases are capitalised in the balance sheet. Those held under hire
purchase contracts are depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Those held under finance leases are depreciated over
their estimated useful lives or the lease term, whichever is the shorter.

The interest element of these obligations is charged to profit or loss over the relevant period. The capital element of the future
payments is treated as a liability.

Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to profit or loss on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued

Pension costs and other post-retirement benefits
The company operates a defined contribution pension scheme. Contributions payable to the company's pension scheme are
charged to profit or loss in the period to which they relate.

Foreign exchange

Transactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the
transactions. At cach reporting end datc, monctary assets and liabilitics that are denominated in forcign currencies are
retranslated at the rates prevailing on the reporting end date. Gains and losses arising on translation in the period are included
in profit or loss.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY

In the application of the company's accounting policies, the director is required to make judgements, cstimates and
assumptions about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates
and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual
results may differ from these estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised where the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the
revision and future periods where the revision affects both current and future periods.

The following judgements have been made in the process of applying the above accounting policies that have had the most
significant effect on amounts recognised in the financial statements:

- Tangible fixed assets

Depreciation is provided in order to write off each asset over its estimated useful life or, if held under a finance lease, over
the lease term, whichever is the shorter. The actual lives of these assets are reviewed annually and may vary depending on a
number of factors. In assessing asset lives, factors such as life cycles and maintenance programmes are taken into account.
Residual value assessment considers issues such as the remaining life of the assets and projected disposal values.

The following are key sources of estimation uncertainty:

- Impairment of tangible fixed assets

In determining whether there are indicators of impairment of the company's tangible fixed assets, factors taken into
consideration by the directors include the economic value in use and whether there are any expected future cash flows to be
gencrated from such assets.

EMPLOYEES AND DIRECTORS

The average number of employees during the year was 23 (2023 - 14).
