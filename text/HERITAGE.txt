2 Accounting policies

Summary of significant accounting policies and key accounting estimates

The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have
been consistently applied to all the ycars presented, unless otherwise stated.

Statement of compliance

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102 Section 1A smaller entities -
‘The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland’ and the Companies Act 2006 (as
applicable to companies subject to the small companies' regime).

Basis of preparation

These financial statements have been prepared using the historical cost convention except that as disclosed in the accounting
policies certain items are shown at fair value.

These financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling (£), which is the Company’s functional
currency. All amounts have been rounded to the nearest pound, unless otherwise indicated.

Revenue recognition

Turnover comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and provision of services in the
ordinary course of the company’s activities. Turnover is shown net of sales/value added tax, returns, rebates and discounts.

The company recognises revenue when:

The amount of revenue can be reliably measured;

it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity;

and specific criteria have been met for each of the company's activities.

Tax

The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in profit or loss, except that a change
attributable to an item of income or expense recognised as other comprehensive income is also recognised directly in other
comprehensive income.

Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2023

The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by
the reporting date in the countries where the company operates and generates taxable income.

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences between taxable profits and profits reported in the financial
statements.

Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised when it is probable that they will be recovered against the
reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.

Deferred tax is measured using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and
that are expected to apply to the reversal of the timing difference.

Tangible assets

Tangible assets are stated in the balance shect at cost, less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated
impairment losses.
The cost of tangible assets includes directly attributable incremental costs incurred in their acquisition and installation.

Depreciation

Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than land and properties under construction over their estimated
useful lives, as follows:

Asset class Depreciation method and rate
Motor Vehicle 25% reducing balance method
Goodwill

Goodwill arising on the acquisition of an entity represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the company’s interest in the
net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the entity recognised at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and
accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is held in the currency of the acquired entity and revalued to the closing rate at each
reporting period date. Goodwill is amortised over its useful life, which shall not exceed ten years if a reliable estimate of the
useful life cannot be made.

Amortisation

Amortisation is provided on intangible assets so as to write off the cost, less any estimated residual value, over their useful life as
follows:

Asset class Amortisation method and rate
Other intangible assets 25% straight line

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and call deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily
convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value.

Trade debtors

Trade debtors are amounts duc from customers for merchandise sold or services performed in the ordinary course of business.
Trade debtors are recognised initially at the transaction price. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the
effective interest method, less provision for impairment. A provision for the impairment of trade debtors is established when there
is objective evidence that the company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the
receivables.

Trade creditors

Trade creditors are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from
suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if the company does not have an unconditional right, at the end of
the reporting period, to defer settlement of the creditor for at least twelve months after the reporting date. If there is an
unconditional right to defer settlement for at least twelve months after the reporting date, they are presented as non-current
liabilities.

Trade creditors are recognised initially at the transaction price and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective
interest method.

Borrowings

Interest-bearing borrowings are initially recorded at fair value, net of transaction costs. Interest-bearing borrowings are
subsequently carried at amortised cost, with the difference between the proceeds, net of transaction costs, and the amount due on
redemption being recognised as a charge to the profit and loss account over the period of the relevant borrowing.

Interest expense is recognised on the basis of the effective interest method and is included in interest payable and similar charges.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the company has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for
at least twelve months after the reporting date.

Share capital

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Equity instruments are measured at the fair value of the cash or other resources received
or receivable, net of the direct costs of issuing the equity instruments. If payment is deferred and the time value of money is
material, the initial measurement is on a present value basis.

Dividends

Dividend distribution to the company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the reporting period
in which the dividends are declared.

Defined contribution pension obligation

A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which fixed contributions are paid into a pension fund and the company has
no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions even if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees
the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.

Contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as employee benefit expense when they are due. If contribution
payments exceed the contribution due for service, the excess is recognised as a prepayment.

3. Staff numbers

The average number of persons employed by the company (including directors) during the year, was 14 (2022 - 14).
