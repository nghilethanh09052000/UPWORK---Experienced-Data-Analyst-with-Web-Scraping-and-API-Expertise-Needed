GROUP STRATEGIC REPORT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023

Introduction

The directors present the strategic report for the year ended 31 December 2023.

Business review

The principal activity of the group is that of building contractors.

There has been no significant change in these activities during the year.

Turnover has increased by 0.5% to £119.4m (2022: £118.8m). Overall, a net profit before tax of £7.9m was achieved for the year
ended 31 December 2023 compared to a net profit before tax of £7.3m reported for the year ended 31 December 2022. The group
asset base remains strong, with net assets of £45.3m at 31 December 2023 (2022: £38.7m). The group's directors are satisfied with
the group's performance in the year and the emphasis going forward continues to be on securing turnover that will result in sustainable
profitability and cash flow.

Principal risks and uncertainties

The management of the business and the execution of the group's strategy are subject to a number of risks. The key business risks
relate to competition, quality of performance and raw material costs.

The group's operations expose it to a variety of financial risks that include the effects of changes in currency risks, credit risks, liquidity
risk and interest rate risk. The board reviews and agrees policies for the prudent management of these risks as follows:

Currency Risk

The group's activities in Europe are conducted primarily in Euros, this results in low levels of currency transaction risk, variances
affecting operational activities in this regard are reflected in operating costs or in cost of sales in the profit and loss accounts in the
years in which they arise. The principal foreign exchange risk is translation-related arising from fluctuation in the sterling value of the

group's net investment in euros.

Finance and interest rate risk

The group's objective in relation to interest rate management is to minimise the impact of interest rate volatility on interest costs in
order to protect recorded profitability. A long term strategy for the management of the exposure considers the amounts of floating rate
debt that is anticipated over the period and the sensitivity of the interest charge on this debt to changes in interest rates, and the
resultant impact on reported profitability.

Liquidity and cash flow risk

The group's objective is to maintain a balance between the continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of borrowings with a
range of maturities. The group's policy is to ensure that sufficient resources are available either from cash balances, cash flows and
hear liquid investments to ensure all obligations can be met when they fall due.

Credit risk

Customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to strict verification procedures in advance of credit being awarded and are
continually being monitored.

Inflation risk

As a result of the rising rate of inflation the group has seen the impact of this through rising costs. The group have an economic policy
in place to review costs regularly and to minimise the impact of these rising costs where possible.

The Directors of Errigal Contracts Limited must act in accordance with their duties under the Companies act 2006. These include a
fundamental duty to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole. This duty has been central to the
board’s decision-making processes and outcomes for many years and will continue to play a significant part in the decision making.
The information which follows below describes how, in performing their duties during the year, the Directors’ have had regard to the
matters set out in Section 172 (1) (a) to (f) of the Act and constitutes the Board’s section 172 statement for 2023.

to the continued success of the business

Employees — the employees of Errigal Contracts Limited are at the heart of the everything the company does. The board have

working environment. During the year, a number of Lunch 'N' Learn events where held which employees learned about healthy eating,
sun awareness, mental health and the benefits of exercise. Promoting health and safety within the company is vital to the board and
they set practical and realistic targets in order to achieve this. The Board continually strive to improve the health and safety
performance by obtaining regular incident reports and ensuring these are adequately dealt with. Furthermore, the board are committed
to a “zero incidents” policy and regularly carry out risk assessments to minimise risk.

directors maintains strong communication with their supply chain partners by having regular meetings as well as obtaining key
information from routine business updates and presentations.

community. They have developed a training academy whereby they offer apprenticeships to local people who want to work in the
construction industry. Errigal apprentices continued to represent the company in the World Skills UK live finals and uphold excellence
in training standards. The company is also involved with local schools and sports clubs by way of sponsorship and continue to actively
support local charities and local community events.

Directors’ responsibilities statement

The directors are responsible for preparing the Group strategic report, the Directors' report and the consolidated financial statements in
accordance with applicable law and regulations.

Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors have elected to
prepare the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice), including Financial Reporting Standard 102 ‘The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in
the UK and Republic of Ireland’. Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied
that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that
period.

In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:

select suitable accounting policies for the Group's financial statements and then apply them consistently;
make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;

state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and
explained in the financial statements;

prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue in
business.

The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the company's
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and the Group and to enable
them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the
assets of the company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other
irregularities.

Future developments

The group believes that performance will improve for the incoming year as a result of securing new profitable contracts and the focus
continues to be exploring new geographical markets.

Engagement with suppliers, customers and others

DIRECTORS’ REPORT (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023

Greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption and energy efficiency action

In line with the Companies (Directors’ Report) and Limited Liability Partnerships (Energy and Carbon Report) Regulations 2018 and
related government guidance ‘Environmental Reporting Guidelines: Including Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting requirements:
March 2019’, the Group presents details of its carbon and energy usage.

In line with the associated regulations and guidance, the Group has only provided consolidated reporting for companies meeting the
Companies Act definition of a ‘large’ company and were annual energy consumption is greater than 40,000kWh. In addition, under the
associated regulations and guidance, reporting for foreign subsidiaries is not required.

Accordingly, the following report is based on the energy and carbon usage of Errigal Contracts Limited.

As per the associated regulations and guidance, comparative information is not mandatory in the first year of reporting and has not
been presented.

2023 2023 2022 2022

Intensity ratio

The chosen intensity measurement ratio is total gross emissions in metric tonnes CO2e per £m of revenue. Tonnes of CO2e per £m
revenue 4,50 (2022: 10.26).

Quantification and reporting methodology

We have followed the 2019 HM Government Environmental Reporting Guidelines. We have also used the GHG Reporting Protocol —
Corporate Standard and have used the 2020 UK Government's Conversion Factors for Company Reporting.

Gas, biomethane and electricity consumption was based on actual data, obtained from supplier invoices, meter readings and online
supplier portal data dependant on the specific arrangements. Transport fuel consumption was obtained from employee expense
claims and purchase invoices/receipts. The collected consumption data is then converted into greenhouse gas emissions associated
with each activity using annually updated emission factors from the UK government.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023

Measures taken to improve energy efficiency
A sample of energy efficiency actions undertaken in the group during the financial year is outlined below:

Errigal had a strong year as a market leading construction company in the built environment. The company expertise in partition
systems, external facade, interior fitout, ceilings, and bespoke solutions has excelled throughout 2023. The dedicated manufacturing
facility at our headquarters in Monaghan has been developed further and the offices in London, Northern Ireland, and Europe remain
busy. The investment in the Errigal Academy developing competence in the next generation of trade specialists is once again award
winning. We continue to invest in our teams and provide expertise into the Built Environment.

The Enigal sustainability program is embedded across project teams, functions, disciplines, and operational staff. The program was
launched on the 1st of January 2023 and reports across several milestones over the next decade. The word SOLACE was chosen as
its dictionary definition is to comfort in a time of distress, and as you will be aware our planet is under continued pressure from global
warning, carbon emissions and the continued use of fossil fuels. We also used the word SOLACE as an acronym to highlight the focal
points of our program: SOLACE: Sustainability, Circular Economy, Leadership, Alternatives, Carbon Net Zero, Environment

This SOLACE strategy and plan provides all our stakeholders with a clear vision of our intent and outcomes that can be measured,
providing a transparency for data analysis. Accurate data provides us the opportunity to see areas of weakness and positive outcomes
to push forward. We set a base year of 2022 to start establishing our Carbon footprint outputs with a greater understanding of our
impacts through 2023 in preparation to set Science Based Targets in 2025.

SOLACE continues to examine areas to reduce our carbon footprint using data inputs to the Errigal Carbon Tracker. We have in place
several initiatives including driving out the use of fossil fuels where possible and where we have the opportunity on projects to
substitute fossil fuels for renewable energy. The use of our Antrim development facility and the use of Modern Methods of Construction
(MMC) is also enhancing our delivery strategy.

Our Social Value Operational Model continues to follow the UN Sustainable Development Goals framework and enhancing our offering
in the built environment. This includes UN Development Goal Target 8. We remain a strategic partner for several Global Organisations
(Tier 1 Contractors) in the UK and Europe. We have a dedicated Research & Development facility team and a dedicated learning
centre at our headquarters. We work closely with manufacturers in our industry across all sectors testing new products, equipment, and
technology to continually develop and find new solutions to reduce carbon whilst providing decent work.

We continue to drive down waste of construction materials and packaging. We have matured our relationships with major UK recycling
partners to push the agenda on recycling . repurposing, and remanufacturing as part of a strategy for circularity (SOLACE). Our
engagement with several universities has pushed our knowledge and understanding of waste and we will continue the engagement
with academics. Our use of Horizon Scanning and Thought Leadership is moving us developing our relationships with clients and
value proposition too trusted long-term relationships.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023

Measures taken to improve energy efficiency (continued)

As a business we have invested heavily in the development of our people through pursuing further academic qualification, mentoring,
coaching and the Errigal Academy as mentioned earlier. The Errigal Academy provides apprenticeship skills for many individuals from
disadvantaged backgrounds and those wishing to reinvent themselves through our academy. The Academy provides not only practical
work skills but also helps with financial matters, how to budget and domestic skills like cooking and cleaning. The Errigal business
launched a cookbook in 2023 to assist all employees with making healthy and nutritious meals. The restorative care and
communication training delivered by external specialists was richly received by our inhouse specialist Resident Liasion Officers (RLO)
as we empathise with those currently residing in buildings with non-compliant fire materials, like Grenfell.

We have identified five Key Performance Indicators that will remain in place for the next three years in order that we can gather usable
data for analytics and in pursuit of credible change:

Carbon footprint - We measure Scopes 1, 2 and 3 Upstream (Categories 3,5,6,7) of GHG emissions. The figures for 2023 provide a
review of our emissions. Consumption of Energy — We are pushing our technology including the internet of things (loT) which provide
us valuable information on energy consumption.

Supply Chain Engagement is being driven at a Corporate level and whilst in its infancy remains an integral part of our understanding
and lowering of Scope 3 emissions. The carbon attraction from logistics and in particular delivery miles has meant ongoing discussions
with suppliers regarding supply chain miles. The Supply Chain miles to date have been averages in some cases and to move forward
we are looking at Life Cycle Analysis, broken down into Cradle to Gate, Cradle to Site and Cradle to Grave.

Social impact - At the heart of the business we are moving towards reporting by Environmental, social and governance (ESG)
reporting. We believe this gives us a greater insight into the social impacts of our operations. We are investigating a new software tool
to enable us greater transparency for benchmarking across our peers but also to set Science Based Targets (SBTi)

We continue to operate our SHEQ Management systems to the relevant standards applicable to the business including but not limited
to 1$09001,1SO45001,1ISO45003,1S014001. We have moving to ESG Reporting and have appointed 5 sustainability champions to
cover every key function, category, and country across the business — R&D, Procurement, Design, SHEQ, Waste. We are building
expertise in behaviour change including understanding individual carbon footprints (both at home and Work).

Disclosure of information to auditors
Each of the persons who are directors at the time when this Directors' report is approved has confirmed that:

so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the company and the Group's auditors are
unaware, and

the director has taken all the steps that ought to have been taken as a director in order to be aware of any relevant audit
information and to establish that the company and the Group's auditors are aware of that information.

Post balance sheet events
There have been no significant events affecting the Group since the year end.

This report was approved by the board on 19 September 2024 and signed on its behalf.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ERRIGAL CONTRACTS LIMITED

Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of Errigal Contracts Limited (the ‘parent company’) and its subsidiaries (the 'Group') for the
year ended 31 December 2023, which comprise the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the Consolidated Balance
Sheet, the Company Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, the
Company Statement of Changes in Equity and the related notes, including a summary of significant accounting policies. The financial
reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including
Financial Reporting Standard 102 ‘The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland’ (United Kingdom
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

In our opinion the financial statements:

give a true and fair view of the state of the Group's and of the parent company's affairs as at 31 December 2023 and of the
Group's profit for the year then ended;

have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and

have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of

the financial statements in the United Kingdom, including the Financial Reporting Council's Ethical Standard and we have fulfilled our
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Conclusions relating to going concern

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the
preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that,
individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group's or the parent company's ability to continue as a going concern for
a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this
report.

ERRIGAL CONTRACTS LIMITED

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ERRIGAL CONTRACTS LIMITED (CONTINUED)

Other information

The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our Auditors’
report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the Annual Report. Our opinion on the financial
statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express
any form of assurance conclusion thereon. Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the
other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are
required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work
we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

the information given in the Group strategic report and the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
the Group strategic report and the Directors' report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

Matters on which we are required to report by exception

In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the parent company and its environment obtained in the course of
the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the Group strategic report or the Directors’ report.

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if,
in our opinion:

adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been
received from branches not visited by us; or

the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or

certain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or

we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

Responsibilities of directors

As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 4, the directors are responsible for the preparation of
the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors
determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud
or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group's and the parent company’s ability to
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of
accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic
alternative but to do so.

ERRIGAL CONTRACTS LIMITED

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ERRIGAL CONTRACTS LIMITED (CONTINUED)

Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an Auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high
level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate,
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Group financial statements

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our
responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our
procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below:

We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory framework applicable to the company through enquiry of management,
industry research and the application of cumulative audit knowledge. We identified the following principal laws and regulations relevant
to the company — Companies Act 2006 and the Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland (FRS 102).

We developed an understanding of the key fraud risks to the entity (including how fraud might occur), the controls in place to help
mitigate those risks, and the accounts, balances and disclosures within the financial statements which may be susceptible to
management bias. Our understanding was obtained through review of the financial statements for significant accounting estimates,
analysis of journal entries, walkthrough of the key controls cycles in place and enquiry of management.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs (UK), we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout
the audit. We also:

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and
perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from
error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion of the effectiveness of the company’s internal control.

Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related
disclosures made by the directors.

Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors’ use of lhe going concern basis of accounling and, based on the audil
evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the
company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw
attention in our Auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to
modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our Auditors' report. However,
future events or conditions may cause the company to cease to continue as a going concern.

Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the
financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the
Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and
performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and
significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we

Page 10

identify during our audit.

Use of our report

This report is made solely to the company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006.
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company's members those matters we are required to state to them
in an Auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to
anyone other than the company and the company's members, as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have
formed.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023

1.

General information

Errigal Contracts Limited (“the company”) is a private limited company domiciled and incorporated in England and Wales. The
registered office is 8 Oliver Avenue, South Norwood, London, SE25 6TY.

The principal activity of the group is that of building contractors.

Accounting policies

2.1. Basis of preparation of financial statements

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention unless otherwise specified within these
accounting policies and in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102, the Financial Reporting Standard
applicable in the UK and the Republic of Ireland and the Companies Act 2006.

The preparation of financial statements in compliance with FRS 102 requires the use of certain critical accounting
estimates. It also requires Group management to exercise judgement in applying the Group's accounting policies (see
note 3).

The company has taken advantage of the exemption allowed under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and has not
presented its own Statement of comprehensive income in these financial statements.

The company is a qualifying entity for the purposes of FRS 102, being a member of a group where the parent of that
group prepares publicly available consolidated financial statements, including this company, which are intended to give a
true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the group. The company has therefore
taken advantage of exemptions from the following disclosure requirements for parent company information presented
within the consolidated financial statements:

Section 7 ‘Statement of Cash Flows’: Presentation of a statement of cash flow and related notes and disclosures;

and

Section 11 ‘Basic Financial Instruments’ and Section 12 ‘Other Financial Instrument Issues’:

Carrying amounts, interest income/expense and net gains/losses for each category of financial instrument; basis of
determining fair values; details of collateral, loan defaults or breaches, details of hedges, hedging fair value changes
recognised in profit or loss and in other comprehensive income.

Section 33 ‘Related Party Disclosures’: Compensation for key management personnel.

The following principal accounting policies have been applied:

2.2 Basis of consolidation

The consolidated financial statements present the results of the company and its own subsidiaries ("the Group") as if they
form a single entity. Intercompany transactions and balances between group companies are therefore eliminated in full.

The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of business combinations using the purchase method. In the
Balance sheet, the acquiree's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are initially recognised at their fair
values at the acquisition date. The results of acquired operations are included in the Consolidated statement of
comprehensive income from the date on which control is obtained. They are deconsolidated from the date control ceases

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023

2.

Accounting policies (continued)

2.3. Going concern

At the time of approving the financial statements, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the company has
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus the directors continue to adopt
the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.

2.4 Foreign currency translation

Functional and presentation currency
The company’s functional and presentational currency is GBP.
Transactions and balances

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the spot exchange rates at the dates of the
transactions.

At each period end foreign currency monetary items are translated using the closing rate. Non-monetary items measured
at historical cost are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction and non-monetary items measured
at fair value are measured using the exchange rate when fair value was determined.

Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of transactions and from the translation at period-end
exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in profit or loss except
when deferred in other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges.

Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings and cash and cash equivalents are presented in the
Consolidated statement of comprehensive income within ‘finance income or costs’. All other foreign exchange gains and
losses are presented in profit or loss within ‘other operating income’.

On consolidation, the results of overseas operations are translated into Sterling at rates approximating to those ruling
when the transactions took place. All assets and liabilities of overseas operations are translated at the rate ruling at the
reporting date. Exchange differences arising on translating the opening net assets at opening rate and the results of
overseas operations at actual rate are recognised in other comprehensive income.

Revenue
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue
can be reliably measured. Revenue is measured as the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, excluding
discounts, rebates, value added tax and other sales taxes. The following criteria must also be met before revenue is
recognised:

Rendering of services

Revenue from a contract to provide services is recognised in the period in which the services are provided in accordance
with the stage of completion of the contract when all of the following conditions are satisfied:

the amount of revenue can be measured reliably;
it is probable that the Group will receive the consideration due under the contract;
the stage of completion of the contract at the end of the reporting period can be measured reliably; and
the costs incurred and the costs to complete the contract can be measured reliably.
Operating leases: the Group as lessee
Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to sign an operating lease are recognised on a straight-line basis over
the lease term, unless another systematic basis is representative of the time pattern of the lessee's benefit from the use of
the leased asset.
Interest income
Interest income is recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method.
Finance costs
Finance costs are charged to profit or loss over the term of the debt using the effective interest method so that the amount
charged is at a constant rate on the carrying amount. Issue costs are initially recognised as a reduction in the proceeds of
the associated capital instrument.
Borrowing costs
All borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the year in which they are incurred.
Pensions
Defined contribution pension plan
The Group operates a defined contribution plan for its employees. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under
which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. Once the contributions have been paid the Group has no
further payment obligations.
The contributions are recognised as an expense in profit or loss when they fall due. Amounts not paid are shown in

accruals as a liability in the Balance sheet. The assets of the plan are held separately from the Group in independently
administered funds.

Accounting policies (continued)

2.11 Current and deferred taxation

The tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in profit or loss except that a charge
attributable to an item of income and expense recognised as other comprehensive income or to an item recognised
directly in equity is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.

The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the balance sheet date in the countries where the company and the Group operate and generate income.

Deferred tax balances are recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the
balance sheet date, except that:

The recognition of deferred tax assets is limited to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered against
the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits;

Any deferred tax balances are reversed if and when all conditions for retaining associated tax allowances have
been met; and

Where they relate to timing differences in respect of interests in subsidiaries, associates, branches and joint
ventures and the Group can control the reversal of the timing differences and such reversal is not considered
probable in the foreseeable future.

Deferred tax balances are not recognised in respect of permanent differences except in respect of business
combinations, when deferred tax is recognised on the differences between the fair values of assets acquired and the
future tax deductions available for them and the differences between the fair values of liabilities acquired and the amount
that will be assessed for tax. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the balance sheet date.

2.12 Exceptional items

Exceptional items are transactions that fall within the ordinary activities of the Group but are presented separately due to
their size or incidence.

2.13 Intangible assets

Intangible assets are initially recognised at cost. After recognition, under the cost model, intangible assets are measured
at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.

All intangible assets are considered to have a finite useful life. If a reliable estimate of the useful life cannot be made, the
useful life shall not exceed ten years.

2.14 Tangible fixed assets

Tangible fixed assets under the cost model are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any
accumulated impairment losses. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to bringing the asset to
the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.

Page 24

ERRIGAL CONTRACTS LIMITED

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023

2.

Accounting policies (continued)

2.14 Tangible fixed assets (continued)

Depreciation is charged so as to allocate the cost of assets less their residual value over their estimated useful lives,
using the straight-line method.

Depreciation is provided on the following basis:

Freehold property - Not depreciated
Short-term leasehold property - 2% Straight line
Plant and machinery - 25% Straightline
Motor vehicles - 25% Straight line
Fixtures and fittings - 25% Straight line

The assets’ residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted prospectively if
appropriate, or if there is an indication of a significant change since the last reporting date.

Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised
in profit or loss.

2.15 Valuation of investments

Investments in subsidiaries are measured at cost less accumulated impairment.

2.16 Stocks

Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value, being the estimated selling price less costs to complete
and sell. Cost is based on the cost of purchase on a weighted average basis. Work in progress and finished goods
include labour and attributable overheads.

At each balance sheet date, stocks are assessed for impairment. If stock is impaired, the carrying amount is reduced to
its selling price less costs to complete and sell. The impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.

2.17 Debtors

Short-term debtors are measured at transaction price, less any impairment. Loans receivable are measured initially at fair
value, net of transaction costs, and are measured subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less
any impairment.

2.18 Cash and cash equivalents

Cash is represented by cash in hand and deposits with financial institutions repayable without penalty on notice of not
more than 24 hours. Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments that mature in no more than three months from the
date of acquisition and that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash with insignificant risk of change in value.

In the Consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents are shown net of bank overdrafts that are
repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group's cash management.

2.19 Creditors

Short-term creditors are measured at the transaction price. Other financial liabilities, including bank loans, are measured
initially at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are measured subsequently at amortised cost using the effective
interest method.

ERRIGAL CONTRACTS LIMITED

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023

2.

Accounting policies (continued)

2.20 Provisions for liabilities

Provisions are recognised when an event has taken place that gives rise to a legal or constructive obligation, a transfer of
economic benefits is probable and a reliable estimate can be made.

Provisions are measured as the best estimate of the amount required to settle the obligation, taking into account the
related risks and uncertainties.

Increases in provisions are generally charged as an expense to profit or loss.

2.21 Financial instruments

The Group has elected to apply the provisions of Section 11 “Basic Financial Instruments” of FRS 102 to all of its financial
instruments.

The Group has elected to apply the recognition and measurement provisions of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (as adopted
by the UK Endorsement Board) with the disclosure requirements of Sections 11 and 12 and the other presentation
requirements of FRS 102.

Financial instruments are recognised in the Group's Balance sheet when the Group becomes party to the contractual
provisions of the instrument.

Financial assets and liabilities are offset, with the net amounts presented in the financial statements, when there is a
legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to realise
the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Basic financial assets

Basic financial assets, which include trade and other receivables, cash and bank balances, are initially measured at their
transaction price including transaction costs and are subsequently carried at their amortised cost using the effective
interest method, less any provision for impairment, unless the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where the

transaction is measured at the present value of the future receipts discounted at a market rate of interest

Discounting is omitted where the effect of discounting is immaterial. The Group's cash and cash equivalents, trade and
most other receivables due with the operating cycle fall into this category of financial instruments.

Impairment of financial assets

Financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each reporting date.

Financial assets are impaired when events, subsequent to their initial recognition, indicate the estimated future cash flows
derived from the financial asset(s) have been adversely impacted. The impairment loss will be the difference between the
current carrying amount and the present value of the future cash flows at the asset(s) original effective interest rate.

If there is a favourable change in relation to the events surrounding the impairment loss then the impairment can be
reviewed for possible reversal. The reversal will not cause the current carrying amount to exceed the original carrying
amount had the impairment not been recognised. The impairment reversal is recognised in the profit or loss.

Financial liabilities

Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements

entered into. An equity instruments any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after the
deduction of all its liabilities.

2.

Accounting policies (continued)

2.21 Financial instruments (continued)

Basic financial liabilities, which include trade and other payables, bank loans, other loans and loans due to fellow group
companies are initially measured at their transaction price after transaction costs. When this constitutes a financing
transaction, whereby the debt instrument is measured at the present value of the future payments discounted at a market
rate of interest. Discounting is omitted where the effect of discounting is immaterial.

Debt instruments are subsequently carried at their amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.

Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods and services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business
from suppliers. Trade payables are classified as current liabilities if the payment is due within one year. If not, they
represent non-current liabilities. Trade payables are initially recognised at their transaction price and subsequently are
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Discounting is omitted where the effect of discounting is
immaterial.

Derecognition of financial assets

Financial assets are derecognised when their contractual right to future cash flow expire, or are settled, or when the

Group transfers the asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to another party. If significant risks and
rewards of ownership are retained after the transfer to another party. then the Group will continue to recognise the value
of the portion of the risks and rewards retained.

Derecognition of financial liabilities

Financial liabilities are derecognised when the Group's contractual obligations expire or are discharged or cancelled,

2.22 Dividends

Equity dividends are recognised when they become legally payable. Interim equity dividends are recognised when paid.
Final equity dividends are recognised when approved by the shareholders at an annual general meeting.

Judgements in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty

In the application of the Company's accounting policies, the directors are required to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates
and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual

results may differ from these estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are
recagnised in the period in which the estimate is revised where the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the
revision and future periods where the revision affects both current and future periods.

The following judgements (apart from those involving estimates) have had the most significant effect on amounts recognised in
the financial statements.

Amounts recoverable on contracts

When the outcome of a construction project contract can be estimated reliably and it is probable that the contract will be
profitable, contract revenue and accruals/costs are recognised over the period of the contract by reference to the stage of
completion using the 'percentage-of-completion-method' to determine the appropriate amount to recognise in a given period.
When it is probable that the total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised immediately.
