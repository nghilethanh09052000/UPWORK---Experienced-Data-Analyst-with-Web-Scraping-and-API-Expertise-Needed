ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BASIS OF PREPARING THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102 "The Financial
Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland" including the provisions of Section 1A "Small
Entities" and the Companies Act 2006. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost
convention.

TURNOVER
Turnover is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, excluding discounts, rebates,
value added tax and other sales taxes.

TANGIBLE FIXED ASSETS

Depreciation is provided at the following annual rates in order to write off the cost less estimated residual value of
each asset over its estimated useful life.

Plant and machinery etc - 25% on reducing balance and 15% on cost

Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost (or deemed cost) or valuation less accumulated depreciation and
accumulated impairment losses. Cost includes costs directly attributable to making the asset capable of operating
as intended.

TAXATION

Taxation for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Income statement, except to the
extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.

Current or deferred taxation assets and liabilities are not discounted.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued

DEFERRED TAX

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance
sheet date.

Timing differences arise from the inclusion of income and expenses in tax assessments in periods different from
those in which they are recognised in financial statements. Deferred tax is measured using tax rates and laws that
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the year end and that are expected to apply to the reversal of the
timing difference.

Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that they
will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.

HIRE PURCHASE AND LEASING COMMITMENTS
Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to profit or loss on a straight line basis over the period of the
lease.

PENSION COSTS AND OTHER POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS

The company operates a defined contribution pension scheme. Contributions payable to the company's pension
scheme are charged to profit or loss in the period to which they relate.

EMPLOYEES AND DIRECTORS

The average number of employees during the year was 40 (2023 - 34).
