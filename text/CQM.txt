ACCOUNTING POLICIES

8asis of preparing the financial statements

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102 ‘The
Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland" including the provisions of Section 1A
“Small Entities" and the Companies Act 2006. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical
cost convention.

The preparation of the financial statements requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also
requires management to exercise judgement in applying the Company's accounting policies. These estimates
and judgements are continually reviewed and are based on experience and other factors, including
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

In the opinion of management, there are no key areas of judgement of key sources of estimation uncertainty
that have a significant effect on the financial statements.

Going concern

The board recieved detailed forecasts as part of the budget setting exercise for 2024/25. These have been
reviewed alongside an updated forecast with no material changes. The board is also assured that performance
in Pl & P2 is tracking in line with the forecast position. Budgets have also been stress tested looking at worst case
scenarios. Based on the analysis, the board concluded that CQM remains a going concern well beyond the next
12 months.

Turnover

Turnover is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Company and
the turnover can be reliably measured. Turnover is measured as the fair value of the consideration received or
receivable, excluding discounts, rebates, value added tax and other sales taxes. the following criteria must also
be met before turnover is recognised: :

Rendering of services:

Tumover from a contract to provide services is recognised in the period in which the services are provided in
accordance with the stage of completion of the contract when all of the following conditions are satisfied:

- the amount of turnover can be measured reliably:

- it is probable the the Company will receive the consideration due under the contract:

- the stage of completion of the contract at the end of the reporting period can be measured reliably: and
- the costs incurred and the costs to complete the contract can be measured reliably.

Intangible assets
Intangible assets are initially measured at cost. After initial recognition, under the cost model, intangible assets
are measured at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.

Assets under the course of construction are stated at cost and are not amortised until the are brought into use at
the following rates:

Tangible fixed assets

Tangible assets under the cost model are stated at historical cost less accumulated deprecation and any
accumulated impairment losses. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to bringing the
assets to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by
management.

Deprecation is charged as to allocate the cost of assets less their residual value over their estimated useful lives,
using straight line method.

- Furniture and fittings : 20% straight line
- Office equipment : 25% straight line

The asset's residual values, useful lives and deprecation methods are reviewed, and adjusted prospectively if
appropriate, or if there is an indication of a significant change since the last reporting date.

Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are
recognised in profit and loss.

impairment of fixed assets

A review for indicators of impairment is carried out at each reporting date, with the recoverable amount being
estimates where such indicators exist. Where the carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount, the asset is
impaired accordingly.

Financial instruments

The Company only enters into basic financial instrument transactions that result in the recognition of financial
assets and liabilities like trade and other debtors and creditors, loans from banks and other third parties, loans to
related parties and investments in ordinary shares.

Taxation
Taxation for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Income Statement, except to
the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.

Current or deferred taxation assets and liabilities are not discounted.

Current tax is recognised at the amount of tax payable using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.

Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the
balance sheet date.

Timing differences arise from the inclusion of income and expenses in tax assessments in periods different from
those in which they are recognised in financial statements. Deferred tax is measured using tax rates and laws that
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the year end and that are expected to apply to the reversal of
the timing difference.

Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that they
will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.

Hire purchase and leasing commitments

Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to profit or loss on a straight line basis over the period of the
lease.

Pensions

The Company operates a defined contribution pension plan for its employees. A defined contribution plan as
pension plan under which the Company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. Once contribution have
been paid the Company has not further payment obligations,

The contributions are recognised as an expense in the profit or loss when they fall due. Amounts not paid are
shown in accrual as a liability in the Statement of Financial Position. The assets of the plan are held separately
from the Company in independently administered funds.

Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the Company has an obligation at the reporting date as a result of a past event,
it is probable that the entity will be required to transfer economic benefits in settlement and the amount of the
obligation can be estimated reliably. Provisions are recognised as a liability in the statement of financial position
and the amount of the provision as an expense in the statement of comprehensive income.

Provisions are initially measured at the best estimate of the amount required to settle the obligation at the
reporting date and subsequently reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted to reflect the best estimate of
the amount the would be required to settle the obligation. Any adjustments to the amounts previously recognised
in profit or loss unless the provision was originally recognised as part of the cost of an asset. Where a provision is
measured at the present value of the amount expected to be required to settle the obligation, the unwinding of
the discount is recognised as a finance cost in the statement of comprehensive income in the period it arises.

EMPLOYEES AND DIRECTORS

The average number of employees during the year was 21 (2023 - 22).
