STRATEGIC REPORT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023

Introduction

The director aims to present a balanced and comprehensive review of the business during the year and its
position as at the year-end. The review is consistent with the size and non-complex nature of the business and
is written in the context of the risks and uncertainties which are faced.

Business review

The principal activity of the company in the year continued to be that of civil engineering consultancy services,
with a concentration within the rail industry. The company is a principal supplier of engineering services to
Network Rail and other major contractors.

The current 5 year Control Period (CP) for the railway network came into force in April 2019 and the new
Control Period is due to start on the 1 April 2024.

The financial KPls for the business are company turnover, operating profit and net assets. Company turnover
for the year has increased from £31.7m in 2022 to £43.6m in 2023. Operating profit has decreased from £5.1m
to £3.6m. The director considers that the company has done well in growing turnover in a challenging market.
The increase reflects an increased demand in services on contracts won in previous financial periods.

The current economic and political uncertainties within the UK and the general geo-political issues across the
world have an effect on the global economy and in turn the spending on Infrastructure within the UK.

During 2023, the company has continued to invest heavily in its employees and equipment. 2023 saw the
continued focus from 2022 with continued maintenance of the company’s infrastructure and highly skilled
workforce in anticipation of increased activity moving forward. This was a strategic decision taken to make sure
that we move into Control Period 7 with a strong level of infrastructure.

Following a year of successful trading this has resulted in an increase in net assets from £3.3m to £6.1m. The
level of assets available allows the company to respond to potential opportunities and challenges which may
arise.

The company has coped well with the changing demands of its key customers and has managed to generate
growth within some areas of the business in what is still a challenging market. The company has business plans
in place to continue to meet the ongoing demands from its customer base as well as looking to build upon the
hard work of the current financial year.

The Prince's Trust Enterprise Fellowship Initiative
Bridgeway has recently pledged support and sponsorship for The Prince's Trust Enterprise Fellowship Initiative.

My journey with Bridgeway began from humble beginnings, starting from scratch to build the company we are
all a part of today. This journey, filled with challenges and triumphs, has ingrained in me a deep appreciation for
the spirit of entrepreneurship and the impact it can have not just on individuals, but on communities and
economies at large.

It is this belief in the power of entrepreneurship that has led us to support The Prince's Trust Enterprise
Fellowship Initiative. This remarkable programme is dedicated to nurturing the aspirations of young
entrepreneurs, providing them with the guidance, resources, and encouragement needed to turn their dreams
into reality. By sponsoring, we are contributing to a future where every young person has the opportunity to
achieve their potential and make a positive mark on the world.

Our involvement is more than just sponsorship; it is a testament to our commitment to investing in the future
and supporting the growth of the next generation of leaders and innovators. | am incredibly proud to align
Bridgeway with a cause that champions the entrepreneurial spirit — a spirit that is the very cornerstone of our
own company's foundation.

STRATEGIC REPORT (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023

Together, we are laying the groundwork for a future where every young dreamer has the tools and confidence to
succeed and supporting those from disadvantaged backgrounds is something that | am personally very
passionate about.

Principal risks and uncertainties

The competitive pressures generated by the UK economy and specific challenges within the rail industry remain
an ongoing risk for the company. This risk is mitigated through reviewing the company’s pricing policy and cost
structure regularly, as well as maintaining a strong delivery focus through all levels of the company. The
company has a strong culture based on safety which is lived through the business Vision of the 3Es?, which is
Exceeding Expectations Everywhere Safely and Sustainably.

The company operates track side on the railway network. As such it is required to operate to high standards of
safety and is closely regulated and required to hold a number of safety and competence based accreditations in
order to operate. Safety is at the forefront of everything which the company does and through ongoing
monitoring and training the director and senior management team ensure compliance.

DIRECTOR'S REPORT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023

The director presents his report and the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023.
Director's responsibilities statement

The director is responsible for preparing the Strategic report, the Director's report and the financial statements
in accordance with applicable law and regulations.

Company law requires the director to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the
director has elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice), including Financial Reporting
Standard 102 ‘The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland’. Under company
law the director must not approve the financial statements unless he is satisfied that they give a true and fair
view of the state of affairs of the company and of the profit or loss of the company for that period.

In preparing these financial statements, the director is required to:

. select suitable accounting policies for the company's financial statements and then apply them
consistently;

. make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;

. prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the

company will continue in business.
The director is responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the
company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company
and to enable him to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. He is also
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Results and dividends
The profit for the year, after taxation, amounted to £2,813,507 (2022: £4,338,957).

Dividends paid in the year amounted to ENil (2022: £4,000,000). No dividends were paid or proposed after the
year end.

Director

The director who served during the year is noted on the company information page.

Charitable donations

Charitable donations for the year amounted to £29,552 (2022: £6,065).

Engagement with employees

The company has a policy of consulting staff via elected representatives at managerial level to ensure
information and views.are exchanged and to improve awareness of the financial and economic factors which
affect it. Communication takes place with employees indirectly through internal progress meetings.

The company also communicates directly to employees via safety newsletters, a company information
newsletter and other ad hoc correspondence throughout the year. Annual “Town Hall’ presentations and regular
MD updates are held with all staff.

The company aims to provide clear and fair terms and conditions of employment and remuneration. Employees

are provided with training in order to give them the necessary skills to perform their duties safely and where
appropriate are given opportunities to develop these skills and progress their career.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF BRIDGEWAY CONSULTING LIMITED

Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of Bridgeway Consulting Limited (the ‘company’) for the year ended
31 December 2023, which comprise the profit and loss account, the statement of comprehensive income, the
balance sheet, the statement of changes in equity, the statement of cash flows, analysis of net debt and the
related notes, including a summary of significant accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that has
been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including
Financial Reporting Standard 102 ‘The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of
Ireland’ (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

In our opinion the financial statements:

. give a true and fair view of the state of the company's affairs as at 31 December 2023 and of its profit for
the year then ended;

° have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice; and

. have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable
law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit
of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the company in accordance with the
ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the United Kingdom, including
the Financial Reporting Council's Ethical Standard and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in
accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is + sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Conclusions relating to going concern

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the director's use of the going concern basis of
accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or
conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a
going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for
issue.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the director with respect to going concern are described in the
relevant sections of this report.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF BRIDGEWAY CONSULTING LIMITED
. : (CONTINUED)

Other information

The other information comprises the information included in the annual report other than the financial
statements and our auditor's report thereon. The director is responsible for the other information contained
within the annual report.’ Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and,
except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance
conclusion thereon. Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the
other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course
of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or
apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material
misstatement in the financial statements themselves. if, based on the work we have performed, we conclude
that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

. the information given in the Strategic report and the Director's report for the financial year for which the
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
° _the Strategic report and the Director's report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal

requirements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception

In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the course of
the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic report or the Director's report.

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006
requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:

° adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been
received from branches not visited by us; or

° the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns, or

. certain disclosures of director's remuneration specified by law are not made; or

. we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

Responsibilities of directors

As explained more fully in the Director's responsibilities statement set out on page 3, the director is responsible
for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for
such internal control as the director determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the director is responsible for assessing the company's ability to continue
as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern
basis of accounting unless the director either intends to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or have
no realistic alternative but to do so.

BRIDGEWAY CONSULTING LIMITED

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF BRIDGEWAY CONSULTING LIMITED
(CONTINUED)

Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design
procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of
irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities,
including fraud is detailed below.

Our assessment focused on key Jaws and regulations the company has to comply with and areas of the
financial statements we assessed as being more susceptible to misstatement. These key laws and regulations
included but were not limited to compliance with the Companies Act 2006, United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice, relevant tax legislation and industry specific accreditations.

We are not responsible for preventing irregularities. Our approach to detecting irregularities included, but was
not limited to, the following:

e obtaining an understanding of the legal and regulatory framework applicable to the entity and how the entity
is complying with that framework, including a review of legal and professional nominal codes and board
minutes in the year and post year end;

* obtaining an understanding of the entity's policies and procedures and how the entity has complied with
these, through discussions and walkthroughs;

e obtaining an understanding of the entity's risk assessment process, including the risk of fraud;

e designing our audit procedures to respond to our risk assessment; and

e performing audit testing over the risk of management override of controls, including testing of journal entries
and other adjustments for appropriateness, evaluating the business rationale of significant transactions
outside the normal course of business and reviewing accounting estimates for bias.

We assessed the susceptibility of the company's financial statements to material misstatement, including
obtaining an understanding of how fraud might occur, by:

e¢ making enquiries of management as to where they considered there was susceptibility to fraud, their
knowledge of actual, suspected and alleged fraud; and

e considering the internal controls in place to mitigate risks of fraud and non-compliance with laws and
regulations.

In response to the risk of irregularities in relation to non-compliance with laws and regulations, we designed
procedures which included, but were not limited to:

agreeing financial statement disclosures to underlying supporting documentation;

reading the minutes of meetings of those charged with governance;

enquiring of management as to actual and potential litigation and claims;

reviewing compliance certificates in respect of industry specific accreditatons such as RISQS;

reviewing correspondence with HMRC and associated parties in relation to actual litigation, claims or
regulatory inspections.

Whilst considering how our audit work addressed the detection of irregularities, we also consider the likelihood
of detection based on our approach. Irregularities arising from fraud are inherently more difficult to detect than
those arising from error.

BRIDGEWAY CONSULTING LIMITED

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF BRIDGEWAY CONSULTING LIMITED

(CONTINUED)

Because of the inherent limitations of an audit, there is a risk that we will not detect all irregularities, including
those leading to a material misstatement in the financial statements or non-compliance with regulation. This risk
increases the more that compliance with a law or regulation is removed from the events and transactions
teflected in the financial statements, as we will be less likely to become aware of instances of non-compliance.
The risk is also greater regarding irregularities occurring due to fraud rather than error, as fraud involves
intentional concealment, forgery, collusion, omission or misrepresentation. We are not responsible for
preventing non-compliance and cannot be expected to detect non-compliance with all laws and regulations.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial
Reporting Council's website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our

auditor's report.

Use of our report

This report is made solely to the company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company's members
those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest
extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the

company's members, as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Basis of preparation of financial statements

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance
with Financial Reporting Standard 102, the Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and
the Republic of Ireland. These financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis, under
the historical cost convention and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.

The preparation of financial statements in compliance with FRS 102 requires the use of certain
critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise judgement in applying the
company's accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity or
areas where assumptions or estimates are significant to the financial statements are disclosed in
note 2. .

The company is itself a subsidiary company and is exempt from the requirement to prepare group
accounts by virtue of section 400 of the Companies Act 2006. These financial statements therefore
present information about the company as an individual undertaking and not about its group.

The following principal accounting policies have been applied:
Accounting convention

The financial statements of Bridgeway Consulting Limited are prepared in sterling. The financial
statements are for the year ended 31 December 2023 (2022: year ended 31 December 2022).

Bridgeway Consulting Limited (the company) is a limited liability company incorporated and
domiciled in England. The address of its registered office and principal place of business is
disclosed on the company information page. The company provides civil engineering consultancy
services, with a concentration within the rail industry.

Going concern

The company has made a profit during the year and is in a positive net asset position at the year
end. The company has positive cash reserves and bank support in place, if required, to meet its day
to day working capital requirements. The director has prepared forecasts for the next two accounting
periods and has assessed that the company has the ability to continue to operate within the funding
facilities available to it.

The director therefore considers it appropriate for the financial statements to be prepared on a going
concern basis.

1.4 Turnover

1.5

Turnover is recognised to the extent that it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the
company and that the turnover can be reliably measured. Turnover is measured as the fair value of
the consideration received or receivable, excluding discounts, rebates, Value Added Tax and other
sales taxes. The following criteria must also be met before turnover is recognised:

Rendering of services

Turnover from a contract to provide services is recognised in the period in which the services are
provided in accordance with the stage of completion of the contract when all of the following
conditions are satisfied:

. the amount of turnover can be measured reliably;
it is probable that the company will receive the consideration due under the contract;
the stage of completion of the contract at the end of the reporting period can be measured
reliably, and;

° the costs incurred and the costs to complete the contract can be measured reliably.

Where a loss is predicted on a contract this is recognised immediately. Turnover not billed to
customers prior to the balance sheet date is included within accrued income.

Intangible assets
Research and development costs

In the research phase of an internal project it is not possible to demonstrate that the project will
guarantee future economic benefits and hence all expenditure on research is recognised as an
expense when it is incurred. Intangible assets are recognised from the development phase of a
project if and only if certain specific criteria are met in order to demonstrate the asset will generate
probable future economic benefits and that its costs can be reliably measured. The capitalised
development costs are subsequently amortised on a straight line basis over their expected useful
economic lives.

The expected useful economic life of development costs are estimated based on business plans
which set out the development plans and time to market for the associated project.

If it is not possible to distinguish between the research phase and the development phase of an
internal project the expenditure is treated as if it were all incurred in the research phase only.

Tangible fixed assets

Tangible fixed assets under the cost model are stated at historical cost less accumulated
depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Historical cost includes expenditure that is
directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable
of operating in the manner intended by management.

The company adds to the carrying amount of an item of fixed assets the cost of replacing part of
such an item when that cost is incurred, if the replacement part is expected to provide incremental
future benefits to the company. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. Repairs
and maintenance are charged to the profit and loss account during the period in which they are
incurred.

Depreciation is charged so as to allocate the cost of assets less their residual value over their
estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives range as follows:

Leasehold property improvements - 12 years straight line
Motor vehicles - 25% reducing balance
Fixtures, fittings and equipment - 20% straight line

The assets' residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted
prospectively if appropriate, or if there is an indication of a significant change since the last reporting
date.

Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount
and are recognised within ‘depreciation, amortisation and other fixed asset costs’ in the profit and
loss account.

Impairment of fixed assets and goodwill

Assets that are subject to depreciation or amortisation are assessed at each reporting date to
determine whether there is any indication that the assets are impaired. Where there is any indication
that an asset may be impaired, the carrying value of the asset (or cash generating unit to which the
asset has been allocated) is tested for impairment. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount
by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is
the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing
impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash
flows. Non-financial assets that have been previously impaired are revised at each reporting date to
assess whether there is any indication that the impairment losses recognised in prior periods may no
longer exist or may have decreased.

Debtors

Short term debtors are measured at transaction price, less any impairment. Loans receivable are
measured initially at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are measured subsequently at
amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment.

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash is represented by cash in hand and deposits with financial institutions repayable without
penalty on notice of not more than 24 hours. Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments that

mature in no more than three months from the date of acquisition and that are readily convertible to
known amounts of cash with insignificant risk of change in value.

1.10 Creditors

Short term creditors are measured at the transaction price. Other financial liabilities, including bank
loans, are measured initially at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are measured subsequently
at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

1.11 Finance costs

Finance costs are charged to the profit or loss account over the term of the debt using the effective
interest method so that the amount charged is at a constant rate on the carrying amount. Issue costs
are initially recognised as a reduction in the proceeds of the associated capital instrument.

1.12 Dividends

Equity dividends are recognised when they become legally payable. Interim equity dividends are
recognised when paid. Final equity dividends are recognised when approved by the shareholders at
an annual general meeting.

1.13 Pensions
Defined contribution pension plan

The company operates a defined contribution plan for its employees. A defined contribution plan is a
pension plan under which the company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. Once the
contributions have been paid the company has no further payment obligations.

The contributions are recognised as an expense in the profit and loss account when they fall due.
Amounts not paid are shown in accruals as a liability in the balance sheet. The assets of the plan are
held separately from the company in independently administered funds.

Multi-employer pension plan

The company is a member of a multi-employer plan. Where it is not possible for the company to
obtain sufficient information to enable it to account for the plan as a defined benefit plan, it accounts
for the plan as a defined contribution plan. The amount charged to the profit and loss account
represents contributions payable to the scheme in respect of the accounting period and any accrued
shortfalls.

1.14 Leased assets: lessee

Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line
basis over the period of the lease.

When assets are financed by leasing agreements that give rights approximating to ownership
(finance lease), the assets are treated as if they had been purchased outright. The amount
capitalised is the present value of the minimum lease payments payable over the term of the lease.
The corresponding lease commitments are shown as amounts payable to the lessor. Depreciation
on the relevant assets is charged to the profit and loss account over the shorter of estimated useful
economic life and the term of the lease.

Lease payments are analysed between capital and interest components so that the interest element
of the payment is charged to the profit and loss account over the term of the lease and is calculated
so that it represents a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding. The
capital part reduces the amounts payable to the lessor.

1.15 Valuation of investments

Investments in subsidiaries are measured at cost less accumulated impairment. Where merger relief
is applicable, the cost of the investment in a subsidiary undertaking is measured at the nominal
value of the shares issued together with the fair value of any additional consideration paid.

Investments in unlisted company shares, whose market value can be reliably determined, are
remeasured to market value at each balance sheet date. Gains and losses on remeasurement are
recognised in the profit and loss account for the period. Where market value cannot be reliably
determined, such investments are stated at historic cost less impairment.

Investments in listed company shares are remeasured to market value at each balance sheet date.
Gains and losses on remeasurement are recognised in the profit and loss account for the period.

Investments in joint ventures are measured at cost less accumulated impairment.

1.16 Financial instruments

The company only enters into basic financial instruments transactions that result in the recognition of
financial assets and liabilities like trade and other debtors and creditors, loans from banks and other
third parties and loans to and from related parties.

All financial assets and liabilities are initially measured at transaction price and subsequently at
amortised cost.

For financial assets measured at cost less impairment, the impairment loss is measured as the
difference between an asset's carrying amount and best estimate of the recoverable amount, which
is an approximation of the amount that the company would receive for the asset if it were to be sold
at the balance sheet date.

1.17 Foreign currency translation

a) Functional and presentation currency:

Items included in the financial statements are measured using the currency of the primary economic
environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’). The financial statements are
presented in ‘sterling’, which is the company's functional and presentational currency.

b) Transactions and balances:

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates
prevailing at the dates of the transactions.

At each period end foreign currency monetary items are translated using the closing rate. Non-
monetary items measured at historical cost are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the
transaction and non-monetary items measured at fair value are measured using the exchange rate
when fair value was determined.

Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of transactions and from the
translation at period-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign’
currencies are recognised in the profit and loss account except when deferred in other
comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges.

Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings and cash and cash equivalents are

presented in the profit and loss account within ‘finance income or costs’. All other foreign exchange
gains and losses are presented in the profit and loss account within ‘other external charges'.

1.18 Holiday pay accrual
A liability is recognised to the extent of any unused holiday pay entitlement which is accrued at the
balance sheet date and carried forward to future periods. This is measured at the undiscounted
salary cost of the future holiday entitlement accrued at the balance sheet date.

1.19 Onerous leases

Where the unavoidable costs of a lease exceed the economic benefit expected to be received from
it, a provision is made for the present value of the obligations under the lease.

1.20 Provisions for liabilities
Provisions are made where an event has taken place that gives the company a legal or constructive
obligation that probably requires settlement by a transfer of economic benefit, and a reliable estimate
can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Provisions are charged as an expense to the profit and loss account in the year that the company
becomes aware of the obligation, and are measured at the best estimate at the balance sheet date
of the expenditure required to settle the obligation, taking into account relevant risks and
uncertainties.
When payments are eventually made, they are charged to the provision carried in the balance sheet.
1.21 Borrowing costs

All borrowing costs are recognised in the profit and loss account in the year in which they are
incurred.

1.22 Current and deferred taxation

The tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the profit and
loss account except that a charge attributable to an item of income and expense recognised as
other comprehensive income or to an item recognised directly in equity is also recognised in other
comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.

The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of tax rates and laws that have been
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date in the countries where the company and
the comapny operate and generate income.

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences at the reporting date except as
otherwise indicated.

Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered
against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.

Deferred tax is calculated using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the reporting date that are expected to apply to the reversal of the timing difference.

1.23 Financial liabilities and equity

Financial liabilities and equity are classified according to the substance of the financial instrument's
contractual obligations, rather than the financial instrument's legal form.

2. Judgements in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with Financial Reporting Standard 102 requires
the director to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported
amounts of turnover and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results in the future could differ
from the estimates. In this regard, the director believes that the critical accounting policies where
judgements or estimations are necessarily applied are summarised below.

Impairment of non-current assets and accrued income

The company assesses the impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets subject to
amortisation or depreciation whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
value may not be recoverable. Factors considered important that could trigger an impairment review
include the following:

. Significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results;

. Significant changes in the manner of the use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall
business; and

° Significant negative industry or economic trends.

Revenue recognition and recoverability of trade debtors and accrued income

Judgement is applied in the recognition of turnover in respect of work done not invoiced. This represents
amounts where the company has provided services that are accurately measurable but is yet to agree
these amounts with the customer. Estimation is then applied in the recognition of this turnover within the
financial statements.

Trade debtors and accrued income are recognised to the extent that they are judged recoverable.
Management reviews are performed to estimate the level of provision required for irrecoverable debt.
Provisions are made specifically against invoices where recoverability is uncertain.

Management makes allowance for doubtful debts based on an assessment of the recoverability of
debtors. Allowances are applied to debtors where events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Management specifically analyse historical bad debts,
customer creditworthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms when
making a judgement to evaluate the adequacy of the provision for doubtful debts. Where the expectation
is different from the original estimate, such difference will impact the carrying value of debtors and the
charge in the profit and loss account.

Provisions

A provision is recognised when the company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of
the past event for which it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation
and the amount can be reliably estimated. !f the effect is material, provisions are determined by
discounting the expected future cash flow at a rate that reflects the time value of money and the risks
specific to the liability.

Whether a present obligation is probable or not requires judgement. The nature and type of risks for

these provisions differ and the director's judgement is applied regarding the nature and extent of
obligations in deciding if an outflow of resources is probable or not.
