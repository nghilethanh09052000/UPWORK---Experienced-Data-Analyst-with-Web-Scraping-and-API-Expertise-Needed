NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2024

1. General information

The company is a private company limited by shares, registered in England and Wales. The address of the
registered office is 168 Church Road, Hove, East Sussex, BN3 2DL.

2. Statement of compliance

These financial statements have been prepared in compliance with Section 1A of FRS 102, 'The Financial
Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and the Republic of Ireland’.

3. Accounting policies

Basis of preparation

The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, as modified by the revaluation of certain
financial assets and liabilities and investment properties measured at fair value through profit or loss.

The financial statements are prepared in sterling, which is the functional currency of the entity.

Going concern

No material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about the ability of the company to continue as a going
concern have been identified by the dircctors.

Consolidation

The company has taken advantage of the option not to prepare consolidated financial statements contained in
Section 398 of the Companies Act 2006 on the basis that the company and its subsidiary undertakings comprise a
small group.

Revenue recognition

The turnover in the profit and loss account is recognised upon the commencement of training courses and is shown
exclusive of Value Added Tax.

Income tax

The taxation expense represents the aggregate amount of current and deferred tax recognised in the reporting
period. Tax is recognised in profit or loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other
comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, tax is recognised in other comprehensive income or
directly in equity, respectively. Current tax is recognised on taxable profit for the current and past periods. Current
tax is measured at the amounts of tax expected to pay or recover using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted
or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences at the reporting date. Unrelieved tax losses and other
deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of
deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits. Deferred tax is measured using the tax rates and laws that have
been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date that are expected to apply to the reversal of the timing
difference.

Tangible assets

Tangible assets are initially recorded at cost, and subsequently stated at cost less any accumulated depreciation and
impairment losses. Any tangible assets carried at revalued amounts are recorded at the fair value at the date of
revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses. An
increase in the carrying amount of an asset as a result of a revaluation, is recognised in other comprehensive income
and accumulated in equity, except to the extent it reverses a revaluation decrease of the same asset previously
recognised in profit or loss. A decrease in the carrying amount of an asset as a result of revaluation, is recognised in
other comprehensive income to the extent of any previously recognised revaluation increase accumulated in equity
in respect of that asset. Where a revaluation decrease exceeds the accumulated revaluation gains accumulated in
equity in respect of that asset, the excess shall be recognised in profit or loss.

Depreciation
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost or valuation of an asset, less its residual value, over the useful
economic life of that asset as follows:

Leasehold improvements - 5 years straight line

Plant & machinery - 25% reducing balance

Fixtures, fittings and - 33% reducing balance

equipment

Motor vehicles - 25% reducing balance
Investments

Fixed asset investments are initially recorded at cost, and subsequently stated at cost less any accumulated
impairment losses.
Listed investments are measured at fair value with changes in fair value being recognised in profit or loss.

Impairment of fixed assets

A review for indicators of impairment is carried out at each reporting date, with the recoverable amount being
estimated where such indicators exist. Where the carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount, the asset is
impaired accordingly. Prior impairments are also reviewed for possible reversal at each reporting date. For the
purposes of impairment testing, when it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, an
estimate is made of the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. The
cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that includes the asset and generates cash inflows
that largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. For impairment testing of
goodwill, the goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the
cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination, irrespective of whether
other assets or liabilities of the company are assigned to those units.

Stocks

Stocks are measured at the lower of cost and estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell. Cost includes all
costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the stock to its present location and
condition.

Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the entity has an obligation at the reporting date as a result of a past event, it is
probable that the entity will be required to transfer economic benefits in settlement and the amount of the obligation
can be estimated reliably. Provisions are recognised as a liability in the statement of financial position and the
amount of the provision as an expense. Provisions are initially measured at the best estimate of the amount required
to settle the obligation at the reporting date and subsequently reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted to reflect
the current best estimate of the amount that would be required to settle the obligation. Any adjustments to the
amounts previously recognised are recognised in profit or loss unless the provision was originally recognised as
part of the cost of an asset. When a provision is measured at the present value of the amount expected to be required
to settle the obligation, the unwinding of the discount is recognised as a finance cost in profit or loss in the period it
arises.

Financial instruments

Financial instruments are classified and accounted for, according to the substance of the contractual arrangement, as
either financial assets, financial liabilities or equity instruments. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences
a residual interest in the assets of the company after deducting all of its liabilities.

Defined contribution plans

Contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as an expense in the period in which the related service
is provided. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that the prepayment will lead to a
reduction in future payments or a cash refund. When contributions are not expected to be settled wholly within 12
months of the end of the reporting date in which the employees render the related service, the liability is measured
on a discounted present value basis. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as a finance cost in profit or loss
in the period in which it arises.

4. Employee numbers

The average number of persons employed by the company during the year amounted to 56 (2023: 55 ).
