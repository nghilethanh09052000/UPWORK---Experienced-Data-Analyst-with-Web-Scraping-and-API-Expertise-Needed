CLAAS UK Limited

Strategic report
Principal activity and review of the business

The principal activity of the company is to act as a concessionaire for the marketing of agricultural
equipment — exclusively as manufactured by CLAAS KGaA group companies.

Net sales in the year ended 30 September 2024 amounted to £212.9m (2023 - £254.6m) a decrease of
16% from the previous year. This decrease is largely due to a higher than average turnover in 2023,
brought about from carried over sales orders from the 2022 financial year linked to supply chain
difficulties and an in general lower market demand in FY24.

The directors continue to adopt a going concern basis in preparing the financial statements as detailed
in note 1.

Key performance indicators (“KPIs”)

Given the comparative straightforward nature of the business, the company’s directors are of the opinion
that the KPIs used can be financial and strategic in nature. The major indicators used to monitor the
business are the UK market shares for each product group, the level of inventory and the ongoing level
of distribution and marketing costs. Increasing market share is seen by the directors to be part of the
long-term strategic objectives of the business, which in turn will help guarantee the viability of the wholly
exclusive dealer base.

In addition to market shares, we would now also consider our CLAAS Loyalty Index (Net Promoter
Score) as a key KPI. With a score of 70 or above in the past 2.years, we believe our customer
satisfaction to be above average and close to exceptional.

One key indicator in the market is Return on Sales (profit before tax divided by turnover) which for 2024
was 3.7% (2023 — 6.7%). The decrease for 2024 is mainly linked to the lower turnover compared to
previous year. .

Future outlook

The market in 2024/2025 remains a challenge, with volumes expected to be around the same level as
the 2024 financial year. High interest rates, challenging market conditions and the ongoing
Russia/Ukraine conflict are all significant factors, and will be continued to be monitored by the directors.

Principal risks and uncertainties

The management of the business and the execution of the company’s strategy are subject to a number
of risks. The key business risks and uncertainties affecting the company are considered to relate to
competition from both national and independent retailers, employee retention, and product availability.
The impact of the UK leaving the EU and the future relationship with the EU also provides additional
regulation and associated costs, albeit now controlled and maintained. The company manages these
risks and this is discussed further in the s172 on page 2.

N

Financial risk management

The company’s operations expose it to a variety of financial risks that include the effects of changes in
debt market prices, foreign exchange rates, credit risk, liquidity risk and interest rate risk. The company
has in place a risk management program that seeks to limit the impact on the financial performance of
the company.

In order to ensure stability of cash outflows, and hence manage the interest rate risk, the company has
a policy of keeping external debt to a minimum and where necessary borrowing arrangements are made
through group. Further to this, the company seeks to minimize the risk of uncertain funding in its
operations by maintaining an appropriate level of committed bank facilities. The company does not use
derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate costs or exposure to foreign exchange rates and
as such, no hedge accounting is applied.

Given the size of the company, the directors have not delegated the responsibility of monitoring financial
risk management to a sub-committee of the board. The policies set by the board of directors are
implemented by the company’s finance department.

Strategic report (continued)
Financial risk management (continued)
Credit risk

The company has implemented policies that require appropriate credit checks on potential customers
before sales on credit are made. The amount of exposure to any individual counterparty is subject to a
limit, which is reassessed annually. Credit risk in relation to bank balances is considered remote due to
the high credit rating of the bank.

Liquidity risk

The company actively maintains the short-term debt finance, which is designed to ensure the company
has sufficient available funds for operations and planned expansions as disclosed within the going
concern wording below and within note 1.

Fair value interest rate risk

The company has both interest bearing assets and interest bearing liabilities. Interest bearing assets
include cash and group loan balances, all of which earn interest at a fixed rate. The company has a
policy of maintaining group debt at fixed rates to ensure certainty of future interest cash flows. The
directors will revisit the appropriateness of the policy should the company’s operations change in size
or nature.

Going concern

The directors’ have prepared the accounts on a going concern basis as set out in note 1 to the financial
statements.

Stakeholder interests — section 172 (1) statement

The directors must act in accordance with a set of general duties detailed in section 172 of the UK
Companies Act 2006. Applicable to the Board of Directors, both individually and together, they consider
that they have acted in a way they consider good faith, would be more likely to promote the success of
the company for the benefit of its shareholders as a whole and in doing so have regard, amongst other
matters, to:

The likely consequences of any decision in the long term

The interests of the company’s employees

The need to foster the company’s business relationships with suppliers, customers and others
The impact of the company’s operations on the community and the environment

The desirability of the company maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct
The need to act fairly between members of the company

The Company has a rigorous process to ensure stakeholders are included in the decision-making
process, so all relevant persons are aware of the consequences of any long term decision made by the
Company. The Board of Directors, affiliate companies and employees are all included throughout the
year with continuous communications and interactions. This ensures that the interests of the company’s
employees are taken into account at all times. The Board is now regularly reminded about the $172(1)
matters and includes a rolling agenda item at every Board meeting. All environmental and health and
safety matters are also presented to the Board on a monthly basis, whereby any items that have a direct
impact on the local community are discussed and actioned as appropriate. The company has also
implemented a process to be evaluated annually by end customers regarding their products and
services/performance compared to competitors. This fosters key customer business relationships, with
regular contact also held with key suppliers and other business partners. The results are discussed at
board level and areas of action are derived to improve stakeholder satisfaction, maintain high standards
of business conduct and increase competitiveness. CLAAS is a family company, so the directors
promote a family work ethic across all areas of the business. This encourages supporting and
collaborative business relationships and the need to treat peers, customers, suppliers and other key
stakeholders fairly at all times.

ended 30 September 2024.

Under section 414C(11) of the Companies Act, the directors have elected to present information relating
to financial risk management objectives and policies in the strategic report otherwise required by
regulations made under section 416(4) to be disclosed in the directors’ report as the directors consider
this to be of strategic importance to the company.

The directors who served during the year and to the date of this report were:
Directors

O Hoelscher

Directors’ responsibilities statement

The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the financial statements in accordance
with applicable law and regulations.

Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that
law the directors have elected to prepare the company financial statements in accordance with United
Kingdom generally accepted accounting practice (United Kingdom accounting standards and applicable
law), including Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) 102 — “the Financial Reporting Standard applicable
in the UK and Republic of Ireland”. Under company law the directors must not approve the financial
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the
company and of the profit or loss of the company for that period.

In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:

select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material
departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and

e prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to
presume that the company will continue in business.

The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and
explain the company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial
. position of the company and enable them to ensure that the company financial statements comply with
the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information
included on the company's website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Employee involvement

The company’s policy is to consult and discuss with employees, through the Works Council and at
meetings, matters likely to affect employees’ interests.

Information of matters of concern to employees is given through quarterly updates, news bulletins,

Group communications and ad-hoc briefings when required which seek to achieve a common
awareness on the part of all employees.

CLAAS UK Limited

Directors’ report (continued)
Employee involvement (continued)

The CEO quarterly delivers common awareness amongst employees of the company’s and group's
performance and encourages ongoing involvement in contributing to ongoing operational results.

All employees are part of the CLAAS family, a family of about 12,000 employees worldwide who work
for the CLAAS Group.

Employee practices

CLAAS UK Limited pride themselves on upholding best practice when it comes to employment. The
first step is hiring the right people, and ensuring we have a workforce diverse in terms of experience,
skills and culture. We offer excellent benefits as you would expect from a family owned Company, for
example, paying well over the statutory minimum into our employee's pensions, along with pension
education. Employee development is key for us to maintain our market leading position. With our state
of the art Training Academy, growing our own talent, through trainee programs, graduate schemes and
apprenticeships is key to the future success of CLAAS. Within CLAAS UK Limited we currently have 6
apprentices working in various roles in the business. :

Family is key to CLAAS, with not only our employees but also the communities we work within. Our
employees are all entitled to 2 days volunteering leave per year, and we encourage employees to give
blood during the working day if possible. Over the past 5 years, we have raised over £100,000 for
charities close to our employees’ hearts. We also support schools and colleges with educating young
people about agriculture, and in particular, why working in agriculture could be a great career for them.

Energy usage and carbon reporting
Annual quantity of energy consumed in kWh and CO-e per employee

1,364,002.42 kWh consumed by 115 employees = 11,860.89 kWh per employee
(2023-11,618.91kWh)

297 ,232.21CO2e consumed by 115 employees = 2,584.63 COze per employee

The below numbers have been derived using a mix of invoice data and meter readings. We use carbon
conversion factors published by the UK’s Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy
("BEIS”) published in June 2024. All emissions are considered to be Scope 2 (energy indirect)
emissions, as they arise as a consequence of the Company’s activities. The Company has no Scope 1
(direct) emissions.

Directors’ report (continued)
Energy Efficiency Action Taken

To date CLAAS UK Limited has taken the following steps to focus on energy consumption; installation
of smart meters, changing service and maintenance strategies to ensure vehicles or machines operate
more efficiently, use of hybrid vehicles in the motor fleet, replaced a lot of business travel with video
conferencing and upgraded lighting at all sites to LED. Further to this, 100% of CLAAS UK Limited's
electricity is produced by an anaerobic digester based at a local farm. There are a few behavior change
projects in progress the outcome of which can be reported once complete; metering and reporting of
energy KPIs will be improved so targeted actions can be taken. Heating oil has been removed from site
following the redevelopment.

1S050001 applies to our parent company and the whole of the KGaA Group until the next renewal date
of December 2025 following a recent external audit of the CLAAS Group that included UK as a focus
company.

Auditor and disclosure of information to the auditor
Each of the persons who is a director at the date of approval of this annual report confirms that:
e so far as the directors are aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the company’s
auditor is unaware; and
e the directors have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as directors to make
themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the company’s auditor
is aware of that information.

This conformation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of s418 of the
Companies Act 2006.

Deloitte LLP have expressed their willingness to continue in office as auditor and appropriate
arrangements have been put in place for them to be deemed reappointed as auditor in the absence of
an Annual General Meeting.

Independent auditor’s report to the members of CLAAS UK Limited
Report on the audit of the financial statements

Opinion
In our opinion the financial statements of CLAAS UK Limited (the ‘company’:

e give a true and fair view of the state of the company's affairs as at 30 September 2024 and of
its profit for the year then ended;

* have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice, including Financial Reporting Standard 102 “The Financial Reporting
Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland”; and

e have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

We have audited the financial statements which comprise:
e the income statement;

the statement of comprehensive income;

the statement of financial position;

the statement of changes in equity; and

the related notes 1 to 24.

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United
Kingdom Accounting Standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 102 “The Financial Reporting
Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland” (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice).

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and
applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the auditor's
responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report.

We are independent of the company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to
our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the Financial Reporting Council's (the ‘FRC’s’)
Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these
requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to
provide a basis for our opinion.

Conclusions relating to going concern
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern
basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to
events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the company’s ability
to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements
are authorised for issue.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described
in the relevant sections of this report.

Other information

The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial
statements and our auditor's report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information
contained within the annual report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other
information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any
form of assurance conclusion thereon.

Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other
information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the
course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material
inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives
tise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have

Page 7

CLAAS UK Limited

performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required
to report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.

Responsibilities of directors

As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for
such internal contro! as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the company’s ability
to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using
the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the company or to
cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an
audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on
the basis of these financial statements. ,

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the
FRC’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor's
report.

Extent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud
Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design
procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect
of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting
irregularities, including fraud is detaited below.

We considered the nature of the company's industry and its control environment, and reviewed the
company’s documentation of their policies and procedures relating to fraud and compliance with laws
and regulations. We also enquired of management and the directors about their own identification and
assessment of the risks of irregularities, including those that are specific to the company’s business
sector.

We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that the company operates in,
and identified the key laws and regulations that:
e had a direct effect on the determination of material amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. These included UK Companies Act, pensions legislation, tax legislation; and
e do not have a direct effect on the financial statements but compliance with which may be
fundamental to the company’s ability to operate or to avoid a material penalty. These included
Employment Laws, Health and Safety Regulations and GDPR.

We discussed among the audit engagement team regarding the opportunities and incentives that may
exist within the organisation for fraud and how and where fraud might occur in the financial statements.

As a result of performing the above, we identified the greatest potential for fraud in the following area,
and our procedures performed to address it are described below:

e We presume a risk of material misstatement due to fraud relating to revenue recognition. This
has been pinpointed to cut off of revenue. We have performed substantive testing over sales
recognised around the year end and ensured these are recognised in the correct financial year.
We have also performed analysis of credit notes throughout the year and post year end, to
identify unusual trends or relationships between revenue and sales returns.

Page 8

CLAAS UK Limited

In common with all audits under ISAs (UK), we are also required to perform specific procedures to
respond to the risk of management override. In addressing the risk of fraud through management
override of controls, we tested the appropriateness of journal entries and other adjustments; assessed
whether the judgements made in making accounting estimates are indicative of a potential bias; and
evaluated the business rationale of any significant transactions that are unusual or outside the normal
course of business.

In addition to the above, our procedures to respond to the risks identified included the following:

e reviewing financial statement disclosures by testing to supporting documentation to assess
compliance with provisions of relevant laws and regulations described as having a direct effect
on the financial statements;

e¢ performing analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships that may
indicate risks of material misstatement due to fraud;

e enquiring of management concerning actual and potential litigation and claims, and instances
of non-compliance with laws and regulations; and

e reading minutes of meetings of those charged with governance.

Report on other legal and regulatory requirements

Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
e the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for
which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
e the strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable
legal requirements.

In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the
course of the audit, we have not identified any material misstatements in the strategic report or the
directors’ report.

Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report in respect of the following matters if, in our
opinion:
e adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not
been received from branches not visited by us; or
the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.

Use of our report

This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part
16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the
company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no
other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to
anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this
report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Notes to the financial statements
for the year ended 30 September 2024

Accounting policies

The principal accounting policies, which have been applied consistently throughout the year
and preceding year are set out below.

General information and basis of accounting

CLAAS UK Limited is a Private Limited Company limited by shares incorporated in England
and Wales. The address of the registered office is Saxham Business Park, Saxham, Bury St
Edmunds, Suffolk, IP28 6QZ. The nature of the company’s operations and its principal activities
are set out in the strategic report on pages 1 to 3.

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, and in
accordance with the Financial Reporting Standard 102 (FRS 102) issued by the Financial
Reporting Council. :

The functional currency of CLAAS UK Limited is considered to be pounds sterling because that
is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the company operates. These
accounts are rounded to the nearest £'000, unless otherwise stated.

CLAAS UK Limited meets the definition of a qualifying entity under FRS 102 and has therefore
taken advantage of disclosure exemptions available to it in respect of its financial statements.
Exemptions have been taken in relation to financial instruments, presentation of cash flow
statement, related party transactions and remuneration of key management personnel.

Going concern

The company’s business activities together with the factors likely to affect its future
development are set out in the strategic report on pages 1-3. The directors regularly consider
going concern of the CLAAS Group; reviewing trading conditions and results, weather
conditions, agricultural market conditions and impact on their end customers, and impacts to
overall trading now the UK has left the EU.

The Company has a credit line arrangement with CLAAS KGaA mbh. This provides adequate
resources for the Company to trade and meet its liabilities as they fall due for the going concern
assessment to at least 31 December 2025.

Cash flow forecasts show a positive trend in liquidity, which is based on historic data and future
outlook and expectations. The directors are confident that the company has adequate reserves
and resources to continue operations for the foreseeable future, being at least 12 months from
the date of approval of the financial statements, and is well placed to manage its business risk
successfully despite the current uncertain economic outlook. For this reason, they continue to
adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.

Consolidation

The financial statements contain information about CLAAS UK Limited as an individual
company and do not contain consolidated financial information as part of a group. The company
is exempt under section 400 of the Companies Act 2006 from the requirements to prepare
consolidated financial statements as it, and its subsidiary undertakings are included by full
consolidation in the consolidated financial statements of its ultimate parent CLAAS KGaA
GmbH, a general partnership with limited liability registered in Germany.

Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the company becomes party to
the contractual provisions of the instrument.

Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the
contractual arrangements entered into.

All financial assets and liabilities are initially measured at transaction price (including
transaction costs), except for those financial assets classified at fair value through the income
statement, which are initially measured at fair value (which is normally the transaction price
excluding transaction costs), unless the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction. If an
arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, the financial asset or financial liability is .
measured at the present value of the future payments discounted at a market rate of interest
for a similar debt instrument.

Financial assets and liabilities are only offset in the statement of financial position where there
exists a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and the company intends
either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Debt instruments which meet the following conditions are subsequently measured at amortised
cost using the effective interest method:

a) The contractual return to the holder is (i} a fixed amount, (ii) a positive fixed rate or a
positive variable rate; or (iii) a combination of a positive or a negative fixed rate and a
positive variable rate.

b) The contract may provide for repayments of the principle or the return to the holder
(but not both) to be linked to a single relevant observable index of general price inflation
of the currency in which the debt instrument is denominated, provided such links are
not leveraged.

c) The contract may provide for a determinable variation of the return to the holder during
the life of the instrument, provided that (i) the new rate satisfies the condition (a) and
the variation is not contingent on future events other than (1) a change of a contractual:
variable rate, (2) to protect the holder against credit deterioration of the issuer, (3)
changes in levies applied by a central bank arising from changes in relevant taxation
or law, or (ii) the new rate is a market rate of interest and satisfies condition (a).

d) There is no contractual provision that could by its terms result in the holder losing the
principle amount or any interest attributable to the current or prior periods.

e) Contractual provisions that permit the issuer to prepay a debt instrument or permit the
holder to put it back to the issuer before maturity are not contingent on future events,
other than to protect the holder against the credit deterioration of the issuer or a change
in control of the issuer, or to protect the holder or issuer against changes in levies
applied by a central bank or arising from changes in relevant taxation or law.

f) Contractual provisions may permit the extension of the term of the debt instrument,
provided that the return to the holder and any other contractual provisions applicable
during the extended term satisfy the conditions of paragraphs (a) to (c).

Debt instruments that have no stated interest rate (and do not constitute financing transaction)
and are classified as payable or receivable within one year are initially measured at an
undiscounted amount of the cash or other consideration expected to be paid or received, net
of impairment.

Debt instruments not meeting these conditions are measured at fair value through the income
statement.

Commitments to make and receive loans which meet the conditions mentioned above are
measured at cost less impairment.

Accounting policies (continued)

Financial instruments (continued)
Financial assets are derecognised only when a) the contractual rights to the cash flows from
the financial asset expire or are settled b) the company transfers to another party substantially
all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, or c) the company, despite
having retained some, but not all, significant risks and rewards of ownership, has transferred
control of the asset to another party.

Financial liabilities are derecognised only when the obligation specified in the contract is
discharged, cancelled or expires.

Turnover

Turnover represents amounts invoiced in respect of machinery and parts, excluding value
added tax, after deduction of discounts given to customers and the cost of finance subsidies
which are directly related to the sale of machines. Turnover is recognised when the company
has fulfilled its contractual obligations to a customer and has obtained the right to receive
consideration. This is usually on dispatch but is dependent on the contractual terms that have
been agreed with a customer.

Tangible fixed assets and depreciation

Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated
impairment losses. Cost comprises the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other
consideration given to acquire the asset and includes costs directly attributable to making the
asset capable of operating as intended.

Depreciation is not provided on freehold land and assets under construction. Depreciation is
charged on a straight line basis at rates estimated to write off the cost or valuation of fixed
assets over the period of their expected useful economic lives as follows:

Freehold buildings 2%

Plant and machinery 12%-33%
Office equipment 12%-33%
Vehicles 25%

Stocks
Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and the net realisable value (i.e. estimated selling price
less costs to sell). Cost includes direct materials, and direct labour. Cost is calculated using
weighted average cost method. The value of parts and finished goods is shown net of write-
downs

Leases

Rentals under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term, even
if the payments are not made on such a basis. Benefits received and receivable as an incentive
to sign an operating lease are similarly spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Accounting policies (continued)

Impairment of assets

Assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date. If there is
objective evidence of impairment, an impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss as
described below.

Non-financial assets
An asset is impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events
that occurred after initial recognition, the estimated recoverable value of the asset has been
reduced. The recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell
and its value in use.

Where indicators exist for a decrease in impairment loss, the prior impairment loss is tested to
determine reversal. An impairment loss is reversed on an individual impaired asset to the extent
that the revised recoverable value does not lead to a revised carrying amount higher than the
carrying value had no impairment been recognised.

Financial assets

For financial assets carried at amortised cost, the amount of impairment is the difference
between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows,
discounted at the assets original effective interest rate.

For financial assets carried at cost less impairment, the impairment loss is the difference
between the assets carrying amount and the best estimate of the amount that would be
received for the asset if it were to be sold at the reporting date.

Where indicators exist for a decrease in impairment loss, and the decrease can be related
objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the prior impairment
loss is tested to determine reversal. An impairment loss is reversed on an individual impaired
financial asset to the extent that the revised recoverable value does not lead to a revised
carrying amount higher than the carrying value had no impairment been recognised.

Taxation

Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to
be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the balance sheet date.

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not
reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to
pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance
sheet date.

Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that, on
the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be
suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can
be deducted.

Page 16

Accounting policies (continued)

Taxation (continued)

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for timing differences arising from investments in
subsidiaries and associates, except where the company is able to control the reversal of the
timing difference and it is possible that it will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Deferred tax is measured using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the balance sheet date that are expected to apply to the reversal of the timing
difference. In other cases, the measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the
tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the company expects, at the end
of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.

Where items recognised in other comprehensive income or equity are chargeable or deductible
for tax purposes, the resulting current or deferred tax expense or income is presented in the
same component of comprehensive income or equity as the transaction or other event that
resulted in the tax expense or income.

Current tax assets and liabilities are offset only when there is a legally enforceable right to set
off the amounts and the company intends either to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset
and settle the liability simultaneously.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only if: a) the company has a legally enforceable
right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities; and b) the deferred tax assets
and deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either
the same taxabie entity or different taxable entities which intend either to settle current tax
liabilities and assets on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities
simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax liabilities or
assets are expected to be settled or recovered.

Foreign currency amounts

Transaction in foreign currency are converted to sterling at the rate ruling at the date of the
transaction. Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the
exchange rated ruling at the balance sheet date and the translation difference arising are
included in the income statement, together with exchange difference arising from normal
trading activities. -

Pensions

For the defined benefit scheme, the amounts charged to operating profit are the costs arising
from employee services rendered during the period and the cost of plan introductions, benefit
changes, settlements and curtailments. They are included as part of staff costs. The net interest
cost on the net defined benefit liability is charged to profit or loss and included within finance
costs, Re-measurement comprising actuarial gains and losses and the return on scheme
assets (excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability) are
recognised immediately in other comprehensive income.

Defined benefit schemes are funded, with the assets of the scheme held separately from those
of the company, in separate trustee administered funds. Pension scheme assets are measured
at fair value and liabilities are measured on an actuarial basis using the projected unit credit
method. The actuarial valuations are obtained at least triennially and are updated at each
balance sheet date.

Accounting policies (continued)

Pensions (continued)

For the defined contribution scheme, the amounts charged to operating profit are the company
contributions in the period.

Investments in subsidiary undertakings ~
Investment in subsidiary undertakings are recorded at cost plus incidental expenses less any
provision for impairment. Impairment reviews are performed by the directors when there has
been an indication of potential impairment. Amounts derived from a group reorganisation are
classified as investments to ensure the investment reflects net assets transferred.

Investments in associates

The company owns 49% of CLAAS Financial Services Limited (CFS). The Company's
investment in associates are carried at historical cost less accumulated impairment losses,
where applicable. The carrying value of the investments are reviewed for impairment in periods
when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.

Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the company has a present obligation (legal or constructive)
as a result of a past event, it is probable that the company will be required to settle that
obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.

The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to
settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date, taking into account the risks and
uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash flows
estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash
flows (when the effect of the time value of money is material).

When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be
recovered from a third party, a receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that
reimbursement will be received and the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably.

Warranties

The estimated cost of product warranties are provided at the time revenue is recognised. The
warranty provision is established based upon our best estimates of the amount necessary to
settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date.

Other operating income

Other operating income is recognized when the company has fulfilled its contractual obligations
to a customer and has obtained the right to receive consideration. This is usually on invoice

following the provision of services but is dependent on the contractual terms that have been
agreed with a customer. Income is recognized in the period the service was completed.

Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty

In the application of the company’s accounting policies, which are described in note 1, the
directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates
and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are
considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to
accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is reviewed if the
revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision
affects both current and future periods.

Critical judgement in applying the company’s accounting policies

The following are the critical judgements, apart from those involving estimations, that the
directors have made in the process of applying the company’s accounting policies and that
have the most significant effect on the amount recognised in the financial statements.

Wholesale discounts

The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other
factors such as strategic position in the market. Discounts are netted against turnover as
disclosed in note 3 of the financial statements.

Key sources of estimation uncertainty

The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at
the balance sheet date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below.

Warranty and policy (WaP) provision

The WaP provision is measured and recognised based on a reliable estimate of past
experience from reviewing percentages of warranty costs incurred on a regular sale. The
directors have considered all external factors when calculating this provision and consider this
to be the best estimate of anticipated future lifetime warranty costs. This provision is assessed
on an ongoing basis by the directors and is disclosed in note 16 of the financial statements.

Stock provision .

Stock provisions are calculated on a per machine basis, based on the directors’ best
assumption as to the likely realisable value in the coming year, using a combination of sales
pricing and volume assumptions based on historic performance and market data. This is
disclosed in note 11 of the financial statements. The value of the stock provision as at 30
September 2024 is £5,104,365 (2023 - £4,062,204).

Pension assumptions

Directors take advice from the actuary and base their assumptions on realistic longevity and
mortality tables, as well as the discount rate and inflation. These assumptions are assessed
annually and are disclosed in note 18 of the financial statements.

Taxation on profit on ordinary activities (continued)

The CLAAS Group falls within the scope of the OECD model rules of the second pillar for
national implementation of the global minimum tax (Pillar 2). In 2023, the UK's Finance (No. 2)
Bill 2023 was substantively enacted for UK GAAP purposes, to implement global minimum
taxation in accordance with the OECD Pillar Two regime. For FY2024 this legislation is not yet
in effect. Based on an indicative analysis CUK’s exposure to Pillar Two income tax arising from

that legislation is low.

~”* During the year beginning 1 October 2024, the net reversal of deferred tax assets and

liabilities is expected to increase the corporation tax charge for the year by £369k. This is due
to temporary differences between the tax base and the accounting base on fixed assets.
