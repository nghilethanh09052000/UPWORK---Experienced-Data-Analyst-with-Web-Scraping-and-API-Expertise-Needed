2. Statement of compliance

These financial statements have been prepared in compliance with Section 1A of FRS 102, ‘The
Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and the Republic of Ireland’.

3. Accounting policies
Basis of preparation

The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, as modified by the
revaluation of certain financial assets and liabilities and investment properties measured at fair
value through profit or loss.

The financial statements are prepared in sterling, which is the functional currency of the entity.
Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty

The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgements,
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. These estimates and judgements
are continually reviewed and are based on experience and other factors, including expectations
of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

Revenue recognition

Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents
amounts receivable for services rendered, stated net of discounts and of Value Added Tax.

Corporation tax

The taxation expense represents the aggregate amount of current and deferred tax recognised in
the reporting period. Tax is recognised in profit or loss, except to the extent that it relates to items
recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, tax is recognised in
other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.

Current tax is recognised on taxable profit for the current and past periods. Current tax is
measured at the amounts of tax expected to pay or recover using the tax rates and laws that
have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences at the reporting date. Unrelieved
tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that they
will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.
Deferred tax is measured using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the reporting date that are expected to apply to the reversal of the timing difference.

Operating leases
Lease payments are recognised as an expense over the lease term on a straight-line basis. The

aggregate benefit of lease incentives is recognised as a reduction to expense over the lease
term, on a straight-line basis.

Accounting policies (continued)
Operating leases (continued)

Lease income is recognised in profit or loss on a straight line basis over the lease term. The
aggregate cost of lease incentives are recognised as a reduction to income over the lease term
on a straight-line basis. Costs, including depreciation, incurred in earning the lease income are
recognised as an expense. Any initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging the
operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the lease and recognised as an expense
over the lease term on the same basis as the lease income.

Tangible assets

Tangible assets are initially recorded at cost, and subsequently stated at cost less any
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Any tangible assets carried at revalued
amounts are recorded at the fair value at the date of revaluation less any subsequent
accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses.

An increase in the carrying amount of an asset as a result of a revaluation, is recognised in other
comprehensive income and accumulated in equity, except to the extent it reverses a revaluation
decrease of the same asset previously recognised in profit or loss. A decrease in the carrying
amount of an asset as a result of revaluation, is recognised in other comprehensive income to
the extent of any previously recognised revaluation increase accumulated in equity in respect of
that asset. Where a revaluation decrease exceeds the accumulated revaluation gains
accumulated in equity in respect of that asset, the excess shall be recognised in profit or loss.

Depreciation

Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost or valuation of an asset, less its residual
value, over the useful economic life of that asset as follows:

Short Leasehold Buildings - Straight line over term of leases
Fixtures, Fittings & Equipment - 33% reducing balance
Investments

Fixed asset investments consist of freehold investment properties or of leasehold investment
properties where the unexpired term of the lease is more than 20 years. Investment properties
are held for their investment potential and not for use by the company and so their current value
is of prime importance. Investment property is initially recorded at cost, which includes purchase
price and any directly attributable expenditure. Investment property is revalued to its fair value at
each reporting date and any changes in fair value are recognised in profit or loss. If a reliable
measure of fair value is no longer available without undue cost or effort for an item of investment
property, it shall be transferred to tangible assets and treated as such until it is expected that fair
value will be reliably measurable on an on-going basis.

Impairment of fixed assets

A review for indicators of impairment is carried out at each reporting date, with the recoverable
amount being estimated where such indicators exist. Where the carrying value exceeds the
recoverable amount, the asset is impaired accordingly. Prior impairments are also reviewed for
possible reversal at each reporting date.

Accounting policies (continued)
Impairment of fixed assets (continued)

For the purposes of impairment testing, when it is not possible to estimate the recoverable
amount of an individual asset, an estimate is made of the recoverable amount of the
cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. The cash-generating unit is the smallest
identifiable group of assets that includes the asset and generates cash inflows that largely
independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.

For impairment testing of goodwill, the goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the
acquisition date, allocated to each of the cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from
the synergies of the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the
company are assigned to those units.

Stocks

Stocks comprise of computer items purchased to present to beneficiaries as incentives for
successful completion of training programmes. Stocks are measured at the lower of cost and net
realisable value. Cost includes all costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs
incurred in bringing the stock to its present location and condition.

Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the entity has an obligation at the reporting date as a result of a
past event, it is probable that the entity will be required to transfer economic benefits in
settlement and the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably. Provisions are recognised
as a liability in the statement of financial position and the amount of the provision as an expense.

Provisions are initially measured at the best estimate of the amount required to settle the
obligation at the reporting date and subsequently reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted
to reflect the current best estimate of the amount that would be required to settle the obligation.
Any adjustments to the amounts previously recognised are recognised in profit or loss unless the
provision was originally recognised as part of the cost of an asset. When a provision is measured
at the present value of the amount expected to be required to settle the obligation, the unwinding
of the discount is recognised as a finance cost in profit or loss in the period it arises.

Accounting policies (continued)
Financial instruments

A financial asset or a financial liability is recognised only when the entity becomes a party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument.

Basic financial instruments are initially recognised at the transaction price, unless the
arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where it is recognised at the present value of
the future payments discounted at a market rate of interest for a similar debt instrument.

Debt instruments are subsequently measured at amortised cost.

Other financial instruments, including derivatives, are initially recognised at fair value, unless
payment for an asset is deferred beyond normal business terms or financed at a rate of interest
that is not a market rate, in which case the asset is measured at the present value of the future
payments discounted at a market rate of interest for a similar debt instrument.

Other financial instruments are subsequently measured at fair value, with any changes
recognised in profit or loss.

Financial assets that are measured at cost or amortised cost are reviewed for objective evidence
of impairment at the end of each reporting date. If there is objective evidence of impairment, an
impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss immediately.

For all equity instruments regardless of significance, and other financial assets that are
individually significant, these are assessed individually for impairment. Other financial assets are
either assessed individually or grouped on the basis of similar credit risk characteristics.

Any reversals of impairment are recognised in profit or loss immediately, to the extent that the
reversal does not result in a carrying amount of the financial asset that exceeds what the carrying
amount would have been had the impairment not previously been recognised.

Defined contribution plans

Contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as an expense in the period in which
the related service is provided. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent
that the prepayment will lead to a reduction in future payments or a cash refund.

When contributions are not expected to be settled wholly within 12 months of the end of the
reporting date in which the employees render the related service, the liability is measured on a
discounted present value basis. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as a finance cost in
profit or loss in the period in which it arises.

Company limited by guarantee

The company is Limited by Guarantee without any share capital.

Employee numbers

The average number of persons employed by the company during the year amounted to 87
(2023: 91).
