ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of preparing the financial statements

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102 "The Financial
Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland” including the provisions of Section 1A "Small Entities"
and the requirements of the Statement of Recommended Practice, Accounting by Limited Liability Partnerships. The
financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.

Turnover
Turnover is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, excluding discounts, rebates, value added
tax and other sales taxes.

Goodwill
Goodwill, being the amount paid in connection with the acquisition of a business in 2005, is being amortised evenly over its
estimated useful life of twenty years.

Intangible assets
Intangible assets are initially measured at cost. After initial recognition, intangible assets are measured at cost less any
accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.

Tangible fixed assets
Depreciation is provided at the following annual rates in order to write off each asset over its estimated useful life or, if held
under a finance lease, over the lease term, whichever is the shorter.

Plant and machinery - 25% on cost
Fixtures and fittings - 25% on reducing balance
Motor vehicles - 25% on reducing balance

Hire purchase and leasing commitments

Assets obtained under hire purchase contracts or finance leases are capitalised in the balance sheet. Those held under hire
purchase contracts are depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Those held under finance leases are depreciated over
their estimated useful lives or the lease term, whichever is the shorter.

The interest element of these obligations is charged to profit or loss over the relevant period. The capital element of the future
payments is treated as a liability.

Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to profit or loss on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
