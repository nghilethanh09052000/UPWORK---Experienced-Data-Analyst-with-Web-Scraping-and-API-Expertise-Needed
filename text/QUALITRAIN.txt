Accounting policies
Turnover
Turnover is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Turnover is reduced for estimated customer returns, rebates and other similar allowances.
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when all the following conditions are satisfied:
• the Company has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the
goods;
• the Company retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated
with ownership nor effective
control over the goods sold;
• the amount of revenue can be measured reliably;
• it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Company;
and
• the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.
Specifically, revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when goods are delivered and legal title is passed.
Intangible fixed assets
Intangible fixed assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Tangible fixed assets and depreciation
Tangible fixed assets held for the company's own use are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
At each balance sheet date, the company reviews the carrying amount of its tangible fixed assets to determine whether there is any indication that any items have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss.
Depreciation is provided at the following annual rates in order to write off the cost or valuation less the estimated residual value of each asset over its estimated useful life:
Plant and machinery
25% Straight line
Furniture, fittings and equipment
25% Straight line
Research and development costs
Expenditure on research and development is written off in the year it is incurred unless it meets the criteria to allow it to be capitalised. Costs of research are always written off in the year in which they are incurred. Where development costs are recognised as an asset, they are amortised over the period expected to benefit from them. Amortisation of the capitalised costs begins once the developed product comes into use, typically at rate of 33.33% straight line.
Taxation
Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the profit and loss account because of items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and items that are never taxable or deductible. The Company's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.
Deferred tax is recognised on timing differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are generally recognised for all deductible timing differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.
Current or deferred tax for the year is recognised in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.
Freehold investment property
Investment properties are revalued annually and any surplus or deficit is dealt with through the profit and loss account.
No depreciation is provided in respect of investment properties.
Investments
Unlisted investments (except those held as subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures) are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, any changes in fair value are recognised in profit and loss.
Stocks
Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell. Costs, which comprise direct production costs, are based on the method most appropriate to the type of inventory class, but usually on a first-in-first-out basis. Overheads are charged to profit or loss as incurred. Net realisable value is based on the estimated selling price less any estimated completion or selling costs.
When stocks are sold, the carrying amount of those stocks is recognised as an expense in the period in which the related revenue is recognised. The amount of any write-down of stocks to net realisable value and all losses of stocks are recognised as an expense in the period in which the write-down or loss occurs. The amount of any reversal of any write-down of stocks is recognised as a reduction in the amount of inventories recognised as an expense in the period in which the reversal occurs.
Work in progress is reflected in the accounts on a contract by contract basis by recording revenue and related costs as contract activity progresses.
Trade and other debtors
Trade and other debtors are initially recognised at fair value and thereafter stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less impairment losses for bad and doubtful debts.
Trade and other creditors
Short term creditors are measured at the transaction price. Other financial liabilities, including bank loans, are measured initially at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are measured subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Foreign currencies
The functional and presentational currency of the company is Sterling. The accounts are rounded to the nearest pound.
Transactions in currencies, other than the functional currency of the Company, are recorded at the rate of exchange on the date the transaction occurred. Monetary items denominated in other currencies are translated at the rate prevailing at the end of the reporting period. all differences are taken to the profit and loss account. Non-monetary items that are measured at historic cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Leased assets
Where the company enters into a lease which entails taking substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset, the lease is treated as a finance lease.
Leases which do not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Company are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are initially recognised as assets of the Company at their fair value at the inception of the lease or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet date as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance expenses and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance expenses are recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless they are directly attributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalised in accordance with the Company's policy on borrowing costs (see the accounting policy above).
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated in the same way as owned assets.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
In the event that lease incentives are received to enter into operating leases, such incentives are recognised as a liability. The aggregate benefit of incentives is recognised as a reduction of rental expense on a straight-line basis.
Defined contribution pensions
The Company operates a defined contribution plan for its employees.
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. Once the contributions have been paid the company has no further payments obligations.
The contributions are recognised as expenses when they fall due. Amounts not paid are shown in accruals in the balance sheet. The assets of the plan are held separately from the company in independently administered funds.
Provisions
Provisions are made where an event has taken place that gives the Company a legal or constructive obligation that probably requires settlement by a transfer of economic benefit, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Provisions are charged as an expense to the profit and loss account in the year that the Company becomes aware of the obligation, and are measured at the best estimate at balance sheet date of the expenditure required to settle the obligation, taking into account relevant risks and uncertainties.
When payments are eventually made, they are charged to the provision carried in the balance sheet.
