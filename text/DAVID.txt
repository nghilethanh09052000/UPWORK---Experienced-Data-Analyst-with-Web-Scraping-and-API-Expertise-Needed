STRATEGIC REPORT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2024

The directors present the strategic report for the year ended 31 March 2024.

Review of the business

At the time of writing our company's results for the current financial year are showing a considerable improvement over the
previous year’s following tough decisions last October to restructure our marketing activities, re-platform our website and
reduce overall headcount by 7%. These actions have reduced overheads whilst at the same time the customer experience
has improved, whilst both the fashion collection and communication have also improved.

The income statement shows a significant loss, however it should be noted investments and cash have decreased by a very
modest amount. This is mainly due to the significant decrease in stock levels which has been achieved through better
production control and improvements to the forecasting model used to plan production volumes.

Investment has continued to be made in the manufacturing capacity including increasing the number of solar panels and
introducing a heat recovery system within the printing and dyeing process. Over the last 4 years energy efficiency measures
have reduced carbon footprint by a further 45%.

Training remains an important feature both in upskilling the existing workforce and training raw recruits. We have invested
heavily in training apprentices, particularly in machining to increase our sewing capacity for the future. We have seen the
benefits of this program in the current year with customer demand continuing to be met on time. Ofsted have rated our
apprenticeship scheme as good at our first full inspection.

The company retains strong links to Alfreton’s secondary school, David Nieper Academy and to the Spirit of Alfreton with
management guidance and donations via Christopher Nieper Foundation. The academy is now the 6th most oversubscribed
school in Derbyshire.

Principal risks and uncertainties
Economic uncertainty and the shortage of manufacturing and digital marketing skills continue to exert a downward pressure
on growth.

The directors review the liquidity and cashflow risk of the company on a regular basis with surplus funds invested in readily
accessible accounts and short-term investments to ensure peak working capital requirements are managed and appropriate
business ventures are pursued. The company operates a policy to minimise foreign exchange exposure by means of a
natural currency hedge both buying and selling in the Eurozone.

The policy of the Board is ta favour organic growth, funding the future from own resources and continue the established
format of reviewing asset allocation with due recognition to outstanding liabilities, working capital, threats and opportunities.

Applications for employment by disabled persons are always fully considered, bearing in mind the aptitudes of the applicant
concerned. In the event of members of staff becoming disabled, every effort is made to ensure that their employment within
the company continues and that the appropriate training is arranged. It is the policy of the company that the training, career
development and promotion of disabled persons should, as far as possible, be identical to that of other employees.

Employee involvement
The company's policy is to consult and discuss with employees, at meetings, matters likely to affect employees'

common awareness on the part of all employees of the financial and economic factors affecting the
company's performance.

DAVID NIEPER LIMITED

DIRECTORS’ REPORT (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2024

Statement of directors‘ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law
and regulations.

Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors have
elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice
(United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company law the directors must not approve the financial
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of the profit
or loss of the company for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:

* select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company
will continue in business.

The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the company’s
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and enable them to
ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the
assets of the company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other
irregularities.

Statement of disclosure to auditor

So far as each person who was a director at the date of approving this report is aware, there is no relevant audit information
of which the company’s auditor is unaware. Additionally, the directors individually have taken all the necessary steps that they
ought to have taken as directors in order to make themselves aware of all relevant audit information and to establish that the
company's auditor is aware of that information.

Medium-sized companies exemption
This report has been prepared in accordance with the provisions applicable to companies entitled to the medium-sized

companies exemption.

DAVID NIEPER LIMITED

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF DAVID NIEPER LIMITED

Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of David Nieper Limited (the 'company') for the year ended 31 March 2024 which
comprise the statement of comprehensive income, the balance sheet, the statement of changes in equity and notes to the
financial statements, including significant accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their
preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 102 The
Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of ireland (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice).

In our opinion the financial statements:
® give a true and fair view of the state of the company's affairs as at 31 March 2024 and of its loss for the year then
ended;
© have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
* have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial
statements section of our report. We are independent of the company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are
relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Conclusions relating to going concern
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the
preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that,
individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of
at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant
sections of this report.

Other information

The other information comprises the information included in the annual report other than the financial statements and our
auditor's report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report. Our
opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated
in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion trereon. Our responsibility is to read the other information
and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our
knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to he materially misstated. If we identify such material
inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material
misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a
material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.

Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of our audit:
© the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
® the strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.


DAVID NIEPER LIMITED

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF DAVID NIEPER LIMITED (CONTINUED)

Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we
have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report.

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to
report to you if, in our opinion:
® adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from
branches not visited by us; or
® the financial stacements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
* certain disclosures of remuneration specified by law are not made; or
® we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

Responsibilities of directors

As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors
determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether
due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the company's ability to
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of
accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative
but to do so

Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance
is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of
these financial statements.

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with
our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to
which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below.

Our approach to identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including fraud and
non-compliance with laws and regulations, was as follows:

© the engagement partner ensured that the engagement team collectively had the appropriate competence, capabilities
and skills to identify or recegnise non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations;

* we identified the laws and regulations applicable to the Company through discussions with directors and other
management, and from our commercial knowledge and experience of the retail trade;

© we focused on specific laws and regulations which we considered may have a direct material effect on the financial
statements or the operations of the Company;

© we assessed the extent of compliance with the laws and regulations considered above through making enquiries of
management and inspecting legal correspondence; and

° identified laws and regulations were communicated within the audit team regularly and the team remained alert to
instances of non-compliance throughout the audil.

We assessed the susceptibility of the company's financial statements to material misstatement, including obtaining an
understanding of how fraud might occur, by;

* making enquiries of management as to where they considered there was susceptibility to fraud, their knowledge of
actual, suspected and alleged fraud; and
® considering the internal controls in place to mitigate risks of fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations.


DAVID NIEPER LIMITED

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF DAVID NIEPER LIMITED (CONTINUED)

To address the risks of fraud through management bias and override controls, we:

© performed analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships;

* tested journal entries to identify unusual transactions;

*® assessed whether judgements and assumptions made in determining the accounting estimates were indicative of
potential bias; and

© investigated the rationale behind significant or unusual transactions.

In response to the risk of irregularities and non-compliance with laws and regulations, we designed procedures which
included, but were not limited to:

agreeing financial statement disclosures to underlying supporting documentation;

reading the minutes of meetings of those charged with governance;

enquiring of management as to actual and potential litigation and claims; and

discussions with senior management regarding relevant regulations and reviewing the company’s legal and
professional fees.

There are inherent limitations in our audit procedures described above. The more removed that laws and regulations are from
financial transactions, the less likely it is that we would become aware of non-compliance. Auditing standards also limit the
audit procedures required to identify non-compliance with laws and regulations to enquiry of the director's and other
management and the inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence.

Material misstatements that arise due to fraud can be harder to detect than those that arise from error as they may involve
deliberate concealment or collusion.

A further description of our responsibilities is available on the Financial Reporting Council's website at:
https://www.fre.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor's report.

Use of our report

This report is made solely to (he company's members, as a body, in accordance wilh Chapter 3 of Parl 16 of the Companies
Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company's members those matters we are
required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2024

1.3

Accounting policies

Company information
David Nieper Limited is a private company limited by shares incorporated in England and Wales. The registered office
is Saulgrove House, Nottingham Road, Alfreton, England, DE55 7LE.

Accounting convention
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 102 “The Financial Reporting Standard
applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland” (“FRS 102”) and the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

The financial statements are prepared in sterling, which is the functional currency of the company. Monetary amounts
in these financial statements are rounded to the nearest £.

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention. The principal accounting policies
adopted are set out below.

This company is a qualifying entity for the purposes of FRS 102, being a member of a group where the parent of that
group prepares publicly available consolidated financial statements, including this company, which are intended to give
a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the group. The company has therefore
taken advantage of exemptions from the following disclosure requirements:

* Section 7 ‘Statement of Cash Flows’: Presentation of a statement of cash flow and related notes and
disclosures;

* Section 11 ‘Basic Financial Instruments’ and Section 12 ‘Other Financial Instrument Issues: - Carrying amounts,
interest income/expense and net gains/losses for each category of financial instrument; basis of determining fair
values; details of collateral, loan defaults or breaches, details of hedges, hedging fair value changes recognised
in profit or loss and in other comprehensive income.

* Section 33 ‘Related Party Disclosures’: Compensation for key management personnel.

The financial statements of the company are consolidated in the financial statements of David Nieper Holdings Limited.
These consolidated financial statements are available from its registered office.

Going concern

At the time of approving the financial statements the directors have a reasonable expectation that the company has
sufficient resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. In making this determination, the
directors have prepared cash flow forecasts to the 31 March 2025 in which they have considered a range of reasonable
sensitivities to review the company’s liquidity headroom. The board meets on a regular basis to consider the financial
performance of the business and the development of strategic plans and is therefore able to react to circumstances as
they arise. The board acknowledge the challenging economic headwinds in the retail sector and wider economy but
through the business planning activities and forecasts noted previously, the board are satisfied that the company has
adequate resources to manage through this period. On this basis therefore, the board have continued to prepare the
accounts on the going concern basis.

Turnover

Turnover is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods provided in the normal
course of business, and is shown net of VAT and other sales related taxes. The fair value of consideration takes into
account trade discounts, settlement discounts and volume rebates.

Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have
passed to the buyer (usually on dispatch of the goads), the amount of revenue can be measured reliably, it is probable
that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the entity and the costs incurred or to be incurred
in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.

Accounting policies (Continued)

Intangible fixed assets other than goodwill
Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are recognised at cost and are subsequently measured at cost
less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.

Amortisation is recognised so as to wrile off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over their useful
lives an the follawing bases:

Software 25% straight line
Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost or valuation, net of depreciation

and any impairment losses.

Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over their useful
lives on the following bases:

Freehold land and buildings 2% Straight line
Plant and equipment 10-20% straight line
Fixtures and fittings 20% straight line
Computers 25% straight line
Motor vehicles 20% straight line

The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the sale proceeds and the
carrying value of the asset, and is credited or charged to profit or loss.

Fixed asset Investments

Interests in subsidiaries, associates and jointly controlled entities are initially measured at cost and subsequently
measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. The investments are assessed for impairment at each
reporting date and any impairment losses or reversals of impairment losses are recognised immediately in profit or loss

A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the company. Control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies
of the entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.

Impairment of fixed assets

At each reporting period end date, the company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to
determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication
exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any).
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the company estimates the
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.

Stocks

Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable,
direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the stocks to their present location and
condition.

Stocks held for distribution at no or nominal consideration are measured at the lower of replacement cost and cost.
At each reporting date, an assessment is made for impairment. Any excess of the carrying amount of stocks over its

estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell is recognised as an impairment loss in profit or loss. Reversals
of impairment losses are also recognised in profit or loss.

Accounting policies (Continued)

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents are basic financial assets and include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other
short-term liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are
shown within borrowings in current liabilities.

Financial instruments
The company has elected to apply the provisions of Section 11 ‘Basic Financial Instruments’ and Section 12 ‘Other
Financial Instruments Issues’ of FRS 102 to all of its financial instruments.

Financial instruments are recognised in the company's balance sheet when the company becomes party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument.

Financial assets and liabilities are offset, with the net amounts presented in the financial statements, when there is a
legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to realise
the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Basic financial assets

Basic financial assets, which include debtors and cash and bank balances, are initially measured at transaction price
including transaction costs and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method unless
the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where the transaction is measured at the present value of the
future receipts discounted at a market rate of interest. Financial assets classified as receivable within one year are not
amortised.

Other financial assets

Other financial assets, including investments in equity instruments which are not subsidiaries, associates or joint
ventures, are initially measured at fair value, which is normally the transaction price. Such assets are subsequently
carried at fair value and the changes in fair value are recognised in profit or loss, except that investments in equity
instruments that are not publicly traded and whose fair values cannot be measured reliably are measured at cost less
impairment.

impairment of financial assets
Financial assets, other than those held at fair value through profit and loss, are assessed for indicators of impairment at
each reporting end date.

Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred
after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows have been affected. If an asset is
impaired, the impairment loss is the difference between the carrying amount and the present value of the estimated
cash flows discounted at the asset's original effective interest rate. The impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss.

If there is a decrease in the impairment loss arising from an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the
impairment is reversed. The reversal is such that the current carrying amount does not exceed what the carrying
amount would have been, had the impairment not previously been recognised. The impairment reversal is recognised
in profit or loss.

Derecognition of financial assets

Financial assets are derecognised only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or are
settled, or when the company transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to
another entity, or if some significant risks and rewards of ownership are retained but control of the asset has
transferred to another party that is able to sell the asset in its entirety to an unrelated third party.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2024

Accounting policies (Continued)

Classification of financial liabilities

Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements
entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the company after
deducting all of its liabilities.

Basic financial liabilities

Basic financial liabilities, including creditors, bank loans, loans from fellow group companies, are initially recognised at
transaction price unless the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where the debt instrument is measured at
the present value of the future payments discounted at a market rate of interest. Financial liabilities classified as
payable within one year are not amortised.

Debt instruments are subsequently carried at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.

Trade creditors are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business
from suppliers. Amounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less. If not, they
are presented as non-current liabilities. Trade creditors are recognised initially at transaction price and subsequently
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

Other financial liabilities

Derivatives, including interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts, are not basic financial instruments.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently
re-measured at their fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognised in profit or loss in finance costs
or finance income as appropriate, unless hedge accounting is applied and the hedge is a cash flow hedge.

Debt instruments that do not meet the conditions in FRS 102 paragraph 11.9 are subsequently measured at fair value
through profit or loss. Debt instruments may be designated as being measured at fair value through profit or loss to
eliminate or reduce an accounting mismatch or if the instruments are measured and their performance evaluated on a
fair value basis in accordance with a documented risk management or investment strategy.

Derecognition of financial liabilities
Financial liabilitics are derecagnised when the company’s contractual obligations expire or are discharged or cancelled.

Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of transaction costs. Dividends
payable on equity instruments are recognised as liabilities once they are no longer at the discretion of the company.

Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.

Current tax

The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the
profit and loss account because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years
and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The company’s liability for current tax is calculated
using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting end date.

Deferred tax

Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all timing differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the
extent that it is probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable
profits. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the timing difference arises from goodwill or from the initial
recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.

Employee benefits
The costs of short-term employee benefits are recognised as a liability and an expense, unless those costs are
required to be recognised as part of the cost of stock or fixed assets.

The cost of any unused holiday entitlement is recognised in the period in which the employee's services are received.

Termination benefits are recognised immediately as an expense when the company is demonstrably committed to
terminate the employment of an employee or to provide termination benefits.

Foreign exchange

Transactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the first of
each month during which the transaction occurred. At each reporting end date, monetary assets and liabilities that are
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the reporting end date. Gains and losses
arising on translation are included in the profit and loss account for the period.

Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty

In the application of the company's accounting policies, the directors are required to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The
estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be
relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised where the revision affects only that period, or in the period of
the revision and future periods where the revision affects both current and future periods.

2 Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty (Continued)

Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The estimates and assumptions which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount
of assets and liabilities are outlined below.

Impairment of fixed assets
The company assesses the impairment of tangible fixed assets subject to depreciation whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors considered important that could trigger
an impairment review include the following:

* significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results;

® significant changes in the manner of the use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business;

® = significant negative industry or econamic trends.

Depreciation, amortisation and residual values

The directors have reviewed the asset lives and associated residual values of all fixed asset classes and have
concluded that asset lives and residual values are appropriate. The actual lives of the assets and residual values are
assessed annually and may vary depending on a number of factors. In reassessing asset lives. factors such as
technological innovation and maintenance programmes are taken into account. Residual value assessments consider
issues such as future market conditions, the remaining life of the asset and projects disposal values.

Carrying value of stocks

The directors review the market value of and demand for its stocks on a periodic basis to ensure stock is recorded in
the financial statements at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Any provision for impairment is recorded against
the carrying value of stocks. The directors use their knowledge of market conditions, historical experiences and
estimates of future events to assess future demand for the company's products and achievable selling prices.
