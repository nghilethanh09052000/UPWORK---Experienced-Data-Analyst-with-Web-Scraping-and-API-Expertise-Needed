STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES

The directors acknowledge their responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in

Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 102 “The Financial Reporting Standard
applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland” Section 1A, and applicable jaw). Under company law the directors
must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state
of affair’s of the company and of the profit or joss of the company for that period.

In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:

e select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently;

* make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and

* prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the

company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company
and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

2 Accounting policies

Summary of significant accounting policies and key accounting estimates
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These
policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.

Statement of compliance
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102 Section 1A -
‘The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of ireland’ and the Companies Act 2006.

Basis of preparation
These financial statements have been prepared using the historical cost convention except for, where disclosed in
these accounting policies, certain items that are shown at fair value.

The presentational currency of the financial statements is Pounds sterling, being the functional currency of the
primary economic environment in which the company operates. Monetary amounts in these financial statements
are rounded to the nearest Pound.

Name of parent of group
These financial statements are consolidated in the financial statements of VetPartners Group Limited
The financial statements of VetPartners Group Limited may be obtained from Companies House.

Going concern

After reviewing the company's forecasts and projections, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the
company has adequate resaurces to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. The company
therefore continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its financial statements.

Judgements and estimation uncertainty
These financial statements do not contain any significant judgements or estimation uncertainty.

Revenue recognition

Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goads and provision of
services in the ordinary course of the company's activities. Revenue is shown net of sales/value added tax, returns,
rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales within the company. The company recognises revenue when the
amount of revenue can be retiably measured, it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity
and specific criteria have been met for each of the company's activities.

NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2024
{continued}

Government grants

Income received as a resu{t of a government grant are recognised in other income in the period which the company
became entitled to receive the grant. Where a grant has conditional terms, the grant is recognised as a liability
when received and recognised as revenue as and when the conditions attached to the grant have been met.

Tax

The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the profit and loss account,
except that a charge attributable to an item of income or expense recognised in other comprehensive income is
also recognised directly on other comprehensive income.

The current tax charge is calculated on the basis of tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the reporting date in the countries where the company operates and generates taxable income.

Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their
carrying amounts in the financial! statements and on unused tax losses or tax credits in the company. Deferred tax
is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets are reviewed alt each reporting date and a valuation allowance is set up
against deferred tax assets so that the net carrying amount equals the highest amount that is more likely than not
to be recovered based on current or future taxable profit.

Tangible assets
Tangible assets are stated in the balance sheet at cost, less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and
subsequent accumulated impairment losses.

The cost of tangible assets includes directly attributable incremental costs incurred in their acquisition and
installation.

Depreciation
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, over their estimated useful lives, as follows:

Asset Class Depreciation method and rate
Leasehold improvements Straight line over 10 years
Motor vehicles Straight line over 4 years
Fixtures, fittings and equipment Straight line over 3-4 years

Intangible assets

Goodwill arising on the acquisition of an entity represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the
company’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the entity
recognised at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently
measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is held in the
currency of the acquired entity and revalued to the closing rate at each reporting period date.

Page 10

LYNWOOD VETS LIMITED

NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2024
(continued)

intangible assets (continued)

Negative goodwill arising on an acquisition is recognised on the face of the balance sheet on the acquisition date
and subsequently the excess up to the fair value of non-monetary assets acquired is recognised in profit or loss in
the periods in which the non-monetary assets are recovered.

Amortisation
Amortisation is provided on intangible assets so as to write off the cost, less any estimated residual value, over
their useful life as follows:

Asset Class Amortisation method and rate
Goodwill Straight line over 20 years

Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and call deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments
that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value.

Trade debtors
Trade debtors are amounts due from customers for merchandise sold or services performed in the ordinary course
of business.

Trade debtors are recognised initially at the transaction price. All trade debtors are repayable within one year and
hence are included at the undiscounted cost of cash expected to be received. A provision for the impairment of
trade debtors is established when there is objective evidence that the company will not be able to collect all
amounts due according to the original terms of the debtors.

Stocks
Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell. Cost is determined
using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.

The cost of finished goods and work in progress comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour
costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and
condition. At each reporting date, stocks are assessed for impairment. If stocks are impaired, the carrying amount
is reduced to its selling price less costs to complete and sell; the impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit
or loss.

Trade creditors

Trade creditors are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of
business from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if the company does not have an
unconditional right, at the end of the reporting period, to defer settlement of the creditor for at least twelve
months after the reporting date. If there is an unconditional right to defer settlement for at least twelve months
after the reporting date, they are presented as non-current liabilities.

Trade creditors are recognised initially at the transaction price and ali are repayable within one year and hence are
included at the undiscounted amount of cash expected to be paid.

NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2024
(continued)

Leases

Leases in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as
operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over
the period of the lease.

Share capital

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Equity instruments are measured at the fair value of the cash or other
resources received or receivable, net of the direct costs of issuing the equity instruments. If payment is deferred
and the time value of money is material, the initial measurement is on a present value basis.

Defined contribution pension obligation

A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which fixed contributions are paid into a pension fund and the
company has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions even if the fund does not hold
sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.

Contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as employee benefit expense when they are due. If
contribution payments exceed the contribution due for service, the excess is recognised as a prepayment.

Financial instruments

Classification

Financial instruments are classified and accounted for according to the substance of the contractual
arrangement, as financial assets, financial liabilities or equity instruments. An equity instrument is any contract
that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the company after deducting all of its liabilities. Where shares are
issued, any component that creates a financial liability of the company is presented as a liability on the balance
sheet. The corresponding dividends relating to the liability component are charged as interest expenses in the
profit and loss account.

Recognition and measurement

All financial assets and liabilities are initially measured at transaction price (including transaction costs), except for
those financial assets classified as at fair value through profit or loss, which are initially measured at fair value
(which is normaily the transaction price excluding transaction costs}, unless the arrangement constitutes a
financing transaction. If an arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, the financial asset or financial liability
is measured at the present value of the future payments discounted at a market rate of interest for a similar debt
instrument.

Impairment

Assets, other than those measured at fair value, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet
date. If there is objective evidence of impairment, an impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss as described
below.

Anon financial asset is impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that

occurred after initial recognition, the estimated recoverable value of the asset has been reduced. The recoverable
amount of an asset is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.

Page 12

LYNWOOD VETS LIMITED

NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2024
(continued)

impairment (continued)

The recoverable amount of goodwill is derived from measurement of the present value of the future cash flows of
the cash-generating units (‘CGUs') of which the goodwill is a part. Any impairment loss in respect of a CGU is
allocated first to the goodwill attached to that CGU, and then to other assets within that CGU on a pro-rata basis.

Where indicators exist for a decrease in impairment loss, the prior impairment loss is tested to determine reversal.
An impairment loss is reversed on an individual impaired asset to the extent that the revised recoverable value
does not lead to a revised carrying amount higher than the carrying value had no impairment been recognised.
Where a reversal of impairment occurs in respect of a CGU, the reversal is applied first to the assets (other than
goodwill} of the CGU on a pro-rata basis and then to any goodwill allocated to that CGU.

For financial assets carried at amortised cost, the amount of an impairment is the difference between the asset’s
carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the financial asset’s original
effective interest rate.

For financial assets carried at cost less impairment, the impairment loss is the difference between the asset’s
carrying amount and the best estimate of the amount that would be received for the asset if it were to be sald at
the reporting date.

Where indicators exist for a decrease in impairment loss, and the decrease can be related objectively to an event
occurring after the impairment was recognised, the prior impairment loss is tested to determine reversal. An
impairment loss is reversed on an individual impaired financial asset to the extent that the revised recoverable
value does not lead to a revised carrying amount higher than the carrying value had no impairment been
recognised.
