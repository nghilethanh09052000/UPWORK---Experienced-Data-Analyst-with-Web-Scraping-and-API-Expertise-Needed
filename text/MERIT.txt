DIRECTORS’ REPORT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023

The directors present their report and the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023.
Directors’ responsibilities statement

_The directors are responsible for preparing the Directors' Report and the financial statements in accordance with
applicable law and regulations.

Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the
directors have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice), including Financial Reporting
Standard 102 ‘The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland’. Under company
law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair
view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period.

In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:

select suitable accounting policies for the Company's financial statements and then apply them
consistently;

make judgments and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;

prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the
Company will continue in business.

The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain
the Company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the
Company and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They
are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF MERIT SKILLS LIMITED

Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of Merit Skills Limited (the 'Company') for the year ended 31
December 2023, which comprise the Statement of Income and Retained Earnings, the Balance Sheet and the
related notes, including a summary of significant accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that has
been applied in their preparation is applicable faw and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including
Financial Reporting Standard 102 ‘The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of
Ireland’ (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

In our opinion the financial statements:

give a true and fair view of the state of the Company's affairs as at 31 December 2023 and of its profit for
the year then ended;

have been properly prepared | in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice; and

have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable
law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit
of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the
ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the United Kingdom, including
the Financial Reporting Council's Ethical Standard and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in
accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Conclusions relating to going concern

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of
accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or
conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a
going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the
relevant sections of this report.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF MERIT SKILLS LIMITED (CONTINUED)

Other information

The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report other than the financial
statements and our Auditors’ Report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained
within the Annual Report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and,
except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion
thereon. Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other
information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the
audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent
material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the
financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material
misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

. the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are
prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
e the Directors’ Report has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

Matters on which we are required to report by exception

In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Company and its environment obtained in the course of
the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the Directors’ Report.

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006
requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:

adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been
received from branches not visited by us; or

the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or

certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or

we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or

the directors were not entitled to prepare the financial statements in accordance with the small companies
regime and take advantage of the small companies’ exemptions in preparing the Directors' Report and
from the requirement to prepare a Strategic Report.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF MERIT SKILLS LIMITED (CONTINUED)

Responsibilities of directors

As explained more fully in the Directors' Responsibilities Statement set out on page 1, the directors are
responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair
view, and for such internal control-as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Company's ability to
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going
concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Company or to cease operations,
or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an Auditors' Report that includes our
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures
in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities,
including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is
detailed below:
. Enquiry of management and those charged with governance around actual and potential litigation and
claims;

Enquiry of company staff in finance and compliance functions to identify any instances of non-compliance
with laws and regulations;

Performing audit work over the risk of management override of controls, including testing of journal
entries and other adjustments for appropriateness, evaluating the business rationale of significant
transactions outside the normal course of business and reviewing accounting estimates for bias

Reviewing minutes of meetings of those charged with governance;

Reviewing financial statement disclosures and testing to supporting documentation to assess compliance
with applicable laws and regulations.

Because of the inherent limitations of an audit, there is a risk that we will not detect all irregularities, including
those leading to a material misstatement in the financial statements or non-compliance with regulation. This risk
increases the more that compliance with a law or regulation is removed from the events and transactions
teflected in the financial statements, as we will be less likely to become aware of instances of non-compliance.
The risk is also greater regarding irregularities occurring due to fraud rather than error, as fraud involves
intentional concealment, forgery, collusion, omission or misrepresentation.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial
Reporting Council's website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our
Auditors’ Report.

General information

The company is a private company limited by shares, registered in England and Wales. The address of
the registered office is The Barn, Philpots Close, Yiewsley, Middlesex, UB7 7RY.

The principal activity of the company is that of technical and vocational further education.

Accounting policies

2.1

Basis of preparation of financial statements

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention unless otherwise
specified within these accounting policies and in accordance with FRS 102 ‘The Financial Reporting.
Standard applicable in the UK and the Republic of Ireland’ and the requirements of the Companies
Act 2006. The disclosure requirements of Section 1A of FRS 102 have been applied other than
where additional disclosure is required to show a true and fair view.

The following principal accounting policies have been applied:
Going concern

The Directors consider it applicable to prepare the Financial Statements on a going concern basis. In
reaching this conclusion, the Directors have considered the financial projections of the Company for
the foreseeable future, which covers a period of at least 12 months from the date of signing the
Financial Statements.

The ongoing inflationary pressure and increased Bank of England interest rates may have an impact
on the Company's operations over the next 12 months, therefore the Directors have reviewed
forecasts which model a worst case scenario. This model demonstrates that the Company will
continue to be able to repay its liabilities as they fall due for the foreseeable future.

The Company’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development,
performance and position are set out in the Strategic Report. The financial position of the Company,
its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are also described within the financial
statements. .

The Company expects to continue to grow its recurring revenue streams across a broad spread of
sectors, industries and customers. As a consequence, and having reviewed the worst case forecasts
for the coming year, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Therefore, they continue to
adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the Financial Statements.

2.5

Revenue

Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the
Company and the revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is measured as the fair value of the
consideration received or receivable, excluding discounts, rebates, value added tax and other sales
taxes. The following criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised:

Rendering of services .
Revenue from a contract to provide services is recognised in the period in which the services are

provided in accordance with the stage of completion of the contract when all of the following
conditions are satisfied:

. the amount of revenue can be measured reliably;

. it is probable that the Company will receive the consideration due under the contract;

. the stage of completion of the contract at the end of the reporting period can be measured
reliably; and

. the costs incurred and the costs to complete the contract can be measured reliably.

Interest income

Interest income is recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method.

Pensions

Defined contribution pension plan

The Company operates a defined contribution plan for its employees. A defined contribution plan is a
pension plan under which the Company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. Once the
contributions have been paid the Company has no further payment obligations.

The contributions are recognised as an expense in profit or loss when they fall due. Amounts not paid

are shown in accruals as a liability in the Balance Sheet. The assets of the plan are held separately
from the Company in independently administered funds.

2. Accounting policies (continued)

2.6 Current and deferred taxation

The tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in profit-or loss
except that a charge attributable to an item of income and expense recognised as other
comprehensive income or to an item recognised directly in equity is also recognised in other
comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.

The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of tax rates and laws that have been
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date in the countries where the Company
operates and generates income.

Deferred tax balances are recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not
reversed by the balance sheet date, except that:

. The recognition of deferred tax assets is limited to the extent that it is probable that they will be
recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits; and

. Any deferred tax balances are reversed if and when all conditions for retaining associated tax
allowances have been met.

Deferred tax balances are not recognised in respect of permanent differences except in respect of
business combinations, when deferred tax is recognised on the differences between the fair values of
assets acquired and the future tax deductions available for them and the differences between the fair
values of liabilities acquired and the amount that will be assessed for tax. Deferred tax is determined
using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.

Tangible fixed assets

Tangible fixed assets under the cost model are stated at historical cost less accumulated
depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Historical cost includes expenditure that is
directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of
operating in the manner intended by management.

Depreciation is charged so as to allocate the cost of assets less their residual value over their
estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method.

Depreciation is provided on the following basis:

Long-term leasehold property - Over the period of the lease

Office equipment - 15% - 33%
The assets' residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted
prospectively if appropriate, or if there is an indication of a significant change since the last reporting
date. ,

Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount
and are recognised in profit or loss.

Debtors:

Short-term debtors are measured at transaction price, less any impairment. Loans receivable are

- measured initially at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are measured subsequently at amortised

cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment.

2. Accounting policies (continued)

2.9 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash is represented by cash in hand and deposits with financial institutions repayable without penalty
on notice of not more than 24 hours. Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments that mature in no
more than three months from the date of acquisition and that are readily convertible to known
amounts of cash with insignificant risk of change in value.

2.10 Creditors

_ Short-term creditors are measured at the transaction price. Other financial liabilities, including bank

loans, are measured initially at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are measured subsequently at
amortised cost using the effective interest method.

2.11 Provisions for liabilities
Provisions are recognised when an event has taken place that gives rise to a legal or constructive
obligation, a transfer of economic benefits is probable and a reliable estimate can be made.
Provisions are measured as the best estimate of the amount required to settle the obligation, taking
into account the related risks and uncertainties.
Increases in provisions are generally charged as an expense to profit or loss.

2.12 Dividends
Equity dividends are recognised when they become legally payable. Interim equity dividends are
recognised when paid. Final equity dividends are recognised when approved by the shareholders at
an annual general meeting.

3. Employees

The average monthly number of employees, including directors, during the year was 17 (2022 - 13).
