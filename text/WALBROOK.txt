The year 2023 was a period of significant change stemming from the acquisition by IU Group. During the period
following the acquisition, we began aligning our operations with the IU Group while maintaining our unique identity and
mission. This alignment led to some rationalisation of our existing businesses. We decided to withdraw our Financial
Education qualifications and our two full-time undergraduate degrees. At the same time, we introduced a number of
online undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in a broad range of disciplines. We have reaped significant benefits from
being part of a larger group and are able to call on a wide range of resources to improve our speed to market and we can
access technology which will enable LIBF to take a leading position in the provision of online degrees. As we look forward,
our core objective remains to grow and strengthen the business, with scalability a driving force.

Although some of our activities performed disappointingly in 2023, the long-term fundamentals of the business remain
solid across both Higher Education and Professional Education. Despite recording a loss, cash flow remained positive during
the year due to continued support from IU Group and we remain confident for continued financial sustainability into the
future.

Higher Education

Enroiment for our existing full-time undergraduate programme fell short of expectations, with the pool of applicants
dropping significantly below 2023 levels. In its current format, the full-time programme lacks scalability and carries an
unsustainable level of cost. Consequently, the decision was made to phase out this part our provision while ensuring that
current students are not in any way disadvantaged by this decision. In contrast, the collaboration with IU Group has
accelerated growth in online degrees at undergraduate and postgraduate levels. New degrees across a range of disciplines
were launched in Q4 and were well received in the market. We continue to offer a number of banking-related Degree

Apprenticeships, both bespoke and open.
Professional Education

2023 was a challenging year for the Professional Education division. Sharp increases in interest rates resulted in very
low levels of mortgage lending which adversely impacted demand for our market leading CeMAP qualification. Our Trade
Finance qualifications continue to be lower than pre-Covid, largely because of weaker demand from China, one of our key
markets. Financial advice enjoyed another good year, and we expect this trend to continue thanks in part to our newly
revamped Diploma in Financial Advice which has been well-received in the market. In the banking sector, demand for
traditional qualifications continues to fall, and we have begun the process of phasing out some of our existing
qualifications. We continue to be awarded mandates for bespoke training programmes from large financial institutions in

areas suchas Risk and Sustainability.
Financial Education

The Level 2 and Level 3 Financial Education qualifications have been operating against a backdrop of continued
uncertainty in terms of policy and that, added to the lack of scale, led us to decide to withdraw these qualifications with
the last students being assessed in 2025. We are in discussions with other awarding bodies who have expressed interest in
continuing to offer our qualifications in the future.

MENA & APAC Subsidiaries

After 4 years of significant growth, our MENA operation had a disappointing year. This was mainly due to weakening
demand for our core banking qualifications in Abu Ohabi and delays to several large government-sponsored projects. We
expect the picture in 2024 to improve both in Abu Ohabi and also in Saudi Arabia and Qatar where we have strong local
partners and where demand for banking qualifications is strong.

As far as APAC is concerned, we continue to run programmes in Operational Risk for one of the largest financial
institutions in the region and are seeing increased demand in areas such as Fintech and Risk.

LIBF | 5

The Board recognises the importance of proactively managing risks to ensure the Company's continued success. As
part of our risk management strategy, we are actively addressing key areas that present potential challenges while taking
steps to mitigate them

Maintaining a Competitive Edge

We are committed to delivering engaging, relevant and up-to-date qualifications and training and to improving our
competitive edge. Being able to access a wide range of e-learning technology through IU Group will help strengthen our
offerings in markets where such technology plays an important part in customer decisions

Diversification

A major change since the acquisition has been the reduction of our dependence on Financial Services and particularly
Banking which has historically carried significant concentration risk. We are making major changes to our Higher Education
portfolio and have launched and will continue to launch online degrees with a much broader appeal.

Ensuring Financial Sustainability

Adverse impacts such as economic downturns, changes in regulatory framework, shifting student demands and other
external factors may lead to reduced profitability. We aim ta mitigate such risks by ensuring efticient cost management,
enhanced financial planning and scenario analyses, and continued diversification of revenue streams.

Regulatory Compliance

We operate in a sector which is highly regulated, and we deploy significant resources to ensure compliance. Regulation
is regularly monitored by the Board and its Committees.

Prioritising the Student Experience

Akey institutional priority is maintaining an engaging learning environment which encourages students to progress.
We collect student feedback on a regular basis and have a programme of continuous improvement.

Embracing Technological Advancements

Recognising the importance of staying at the forefront of technological advancements in learning, teaching, and
assessment, we are actively investing in scalable, innovative technologies to enhance both remote and traditional learning
experiences. Additionally, we are committed to understanding and adapting to changing student preferences, offering a
diverse range of learning formats to meet student expectations in the post-pandemic landscape.

Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of LIBF Limited (the ‘Company’) for the year ended 31 December 2023 which
comprise the Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income, Statement of Changes in Equity, Balance
Sheet, Cash Flow Statement, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable faw and UK adopted
International Accounting Standards (UK-IAS).

in our opinion, the financial statements:

* give a true and fair view of the state of the Company's affairs as at 31 December 2023 and of the Company’s loss
for the year then ended;

« have been properly prepared in accordance with UK-IAS; and

® have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

Basis For Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing {UK) (ISAs (UK)} and applicable law.
Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the
financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the ethical
requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard, and
we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Conclusions Relating To Going Concern

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the Director's use of the going concern basis of accounting
in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. Our evaluation of the Directors’ assessment of the entity’s
ability to continue to adopt the going cancern basis of accounting included review of management's forecasts of future
performance and ability to meet its liabilities as they fall duc.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or
conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on LI8F Limited's ability to continue as a going
concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the Directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant
sections of this report.

Other Information

The Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in
the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. Our opinion on the financial
statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do
not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in
doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge
obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or
apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial
statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude
that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact, We have nothing to

report in this regard.

LIBF | 7

Opinions On Other Matters Prescribed By The Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

« the information given in the strategic report and the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and

« the strategic report and the Directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal
requirements.

Matters On Which We Are Required To Report By Exception

in the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Company and its environment obtained in the course of the
audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the Directors’ report

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us ta
report to you if, in our opinion:

* adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not
been received from branches not visited by us; or

e the Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or

© certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or

« we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

Responsibilities Of Directors

As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 3, the Directors are responsible for
the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal
control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from
materia! misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial staternents, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a
going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting
unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to
do so.

Auditor’s Responsibilities For The Audit Of The Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinian
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs
(UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic
decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with (aws and regulations. We design procedures in line
with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The
extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregutarities, including fraud is detailed below:

Explanation As To What Extent The Audit Was Considered Capable Of Detecting Irregularities, Including Fraud

Based on our understanding of the Company and industry, we identified that the principal risks of non-compliance with
laws and regulations related to regulatory requirements for the Company and trade regulators such as the Office for
Students, and we considered the extent to which non-compliance might have a material effect on the financial statements.
We also considered those laws and regulations that have a direct impact on the preparation of the financial statements
such as the Companies Act 2006, income tax, payroll tax and sales tax.

LIBF | 8

We evaluated management's incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the financial statements
(including the risk of override of controls), and determined that the principal risks were related to posting inappropriate
journal entries to revenue and management bias in accounting estimates. Audit procedures performed by the engagement
team included:

* — Inspecting correspondence with regulators and tax authorities;

* Discussions with management including consideration of known or suspected instances of non-compliance with
laws and regulation and fraud;

* Evaluating management's controls designed to prevent and detect irregularities;

« = Identifying and testing accounting journal entries, in particular those journal entries which exhibited the
characteristics we had identified as possible indicators of irregularities; and

e = Challenging assumptions and judgements made by management in their critical accounting estimates.

Because of the inherent limitations of an audit, there is a risk that we will not detect all irregularities, including those
leading to a material misstatement in the financial statements or non-compliance with regulation. This risk increases the
more that compliance with a law or regulation is removed from the events and transactions reflected in the financial
statements, as we will be less likely to become aware of instances of non-compliance. The risk is also greater regarding
irregularities occurring due to fraud rather than error, as fraud involves intentional concealment, forgery, coltusion,
omission or misrepresentation.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting
Council’s website at: www.fre org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.

Use Of Our Report

This report is made solely to the Company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company's members those
matters we are required to state to them in an Auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted
by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company's members asa

body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

MEDTES TO THE SPAN

PATEMENTS
KEY ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The financial statements of LIBF Limited for the year ended 31 December 2023 were prepared in accordance with the

UK adopted international accounting standards (UK-IAS) and the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). LIBF
Limited is a medium-sized private limited company limited by shares and is registered in England and Wales (registration
number: 13621269). The financial statements represent LIBF Limited as a single entity (i.e., LIBF Limited subsidiaries are
not included in the financial statements presented). LIBF has taken advantage of the exemption available under s.401 of
the Companies Act 2006 from preparing consolidated financial statements because it is a wholly-owned subsidiary of a
larger group. The parent undertaking which prepares and published consolidated financial statements that include LIBF
Limited is {U Group N.V., whose registered office address is Square Ambiorix 10, 1000 Bruxelles.

The Company follows the acquisition accounting policy as per [FRS 3 Business Combinations. Under this policy, an
acquisition is recognised as a business combination when LI®F Limited obtains control over one or more businesses,
Control is defined as the ability to obtain the variable returns from the acquired business and the power to direct its
activities.

UBF Limited recognises revenue when the contro! of the promised goods or services is transferred to the customer
and we have a probable right to payment for the performance obligation. In accordance with IFRS 15, we estimate the
amount of returns, refunds, and other similar obligations associated with the sale of goods or services. This estimate is
based on historical experience, industry trends, and other relevant factors. The estimated amount of these obligations is
recorded asa liability and deducted from the recognised revenue. Income is predominantly related to tuition fees and
education contracts and is recognised over the length of the course being offered. Any amounts received in advance are
included within deferred income.

Foreign currency transactions arising from normal trading activities are recorded at the rates in effect at the date of
the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at year-end are translated at the year-
end exchange rate. Foreign currency gains and losses are credited or charged to the statement of comprehensive income
and expenditure as they arise.

Current taxes

The Company has not recognised a current tax expense for the year ended 31 December 2023. This is because the
Company has incurred a taxable loss during the reporting period. Current taxes are determined based on the respective tax
results and recognised to the extent that they will probably be recognised for tax purposes. If uncertainties regarding such
recognition exist, tax liabilities are recognised in the amount of the best possible estimate of the anticipated tax payment.
The inclusion of tax liabilities from uncertain tax items in accounting only takes place if their realisation is probable. The
assumptions and decisions made are reviewed at each reporting date and, where necessary, adjusted based on any new
knowledge gained.

Deferred taxes

Deferred taxes are recognised due to temporary differences between the amounts recognised in the respective tax
accounts at national level. As of the reporting period, the Company has no recognised deferred tax assets or liabilities.
Calculations are made according to the liability method of IAS 12. For the assessment of the recoverability of the deferred
tax assets, an assessment is made regarding the extent to which realisation is sufficiently probable and whether sufficient
convincing substantive indicators can be demonstrated. Whether the deferred tax assets can be realised depends on
whether a sufficient level of tax income can be generated in future against which the temporary differences and tax loss
carry forwards can be offset. In this context, existing taxable temporary differences or corporate planning are drawn upon.
If utilisation cannot be expected, then corresponding loss allowances are recognised. The assumptions made here
regarding the future taxable income available for the utilisation of deferred tax assets are nevertheless subject to

LIBF | 13

uncertainties. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are netted if a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against
current tax liabilities exists and if the deferred taxes relate to income taxes that are levied by the same tax authority.

Property, plant and equipment are initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost or valuation, net of
depreciation and any impairment losses. Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less
their residual values over their useful lives on the following bases:

Leasehold improvements Useful life of 4 years
Computer hardware and software Useful life of 3 years
Furniture and equipment Useful life of 5 years
Right of use assets Over the life of the lease

The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the sale proceeds and the
carrying value of the asset and is recognised in the income statement.

LIBF Limited accounts for leases in accordance with IFRS 16 Leases. IFRS 16 requires the recognition of right-of-use
assets and lease liabilities for all ieases with a term of more than 12 months, unless the underlying asset is of low value.
Right-of-use assets represent the Company's right to use underlying leased assets. They are initially recognised at cost,
which includes the initial payment of the lease, any incremental costs directly attributable to the right-of-use asset, and the
present value of non-cancellable lease payments. Subsequent to initial recognition, the assets are depreciated on a
straight-line basis over the useful life of the underlying asset or the lease term, whichever is shorter. The depreciation
method and useful lives are reviewed periodically.

Development expenditure is charged to the income statement in the year it is incurred unless it meets the
recognition criteria of IAS 38 Intangible Assets to be capitalised as an intangible asset. Intangible assets are stated at cost
or fair vatue on recognition less accumulated amortisation and any impairment in value. Amortisation is calculated so as to
write off the cost or valuation of intangible asset over the useful economic life, on the following bases:

Trademark rights Useful life of 16-18 years
Customer relationships (corporate) Useful life of 10 years
Customer relationships (students) Useful life of 3 years
Self-generated courses Useful fife of 2-5 years

The useful lives of our intangible assets vary. Trademark rights, for example, have a useful life of 18 years for LIBF and
CeMAP, and 16 years for CDSC. Customer relationships are categorised by client type, with a 10-year useful life for
corporate relationships and a 3-year useful life for student relationships. Similarly, the useful life of self-generated courses
varies by programme type: 5 years for Professional Education, 4 years for Higher Education, and 2 years for Financial
Education,

interests in subsidiaries are initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated
impairment losses. The investments are assessed for impairment at each reporting data and any impairment tosses or
reversals of impairment losses are recognised immediately by in profit or loss. A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the
Parent company. Control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain benefits
from its activities.

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value and mainly consist of course materials (e.g. books).

LIBF | 14

Unrestricted reserves represent the accumulated net income of LIBF Limited that are retained for future use. The use
of reserves are at the discretion of the Directors and are not subject to any legal statutory restrictions on use.

IFRS 9 stipulates the requirements regarding the recognition and measurement of financial assets and contains three
basic categories for the classification of financial assets: those measured at amortised cost (AC), those measured at fair

value with changes through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) and those measured at fair value with changes through
profit or loss (FVTPL).

The classification of financial assets pursuant to IFRS 9 is carried out based on the business model of the Company for
managing financial assets and the characteristics of the cash flows. Trade receivables are recognised from the date on
which they arise onwards.

The financial assets of LIBF Limited are initially recognised on the trade date if the Company becomes a contractual
party under the contractual terms of the financial instrument. The amount recognised here is the settlement amount.

The loans to related parties are initially measured at fair value. The trade receivables of LIBF Limited do not have any
significant financing component and are therefore measured at transaction price upon initial recognition. Cash is measured

at fair value.

Trade receivables are not sold and are usually recovered by the Company itself. In addition, the underlying contracts
contain exclusively the claim for the payment of the receivable and fulfil the requirements for “standard cash flow
conditions”. For these reasons, the trade receivables undergo subsequent measurement within the “amortised cost”
category. Both cash and other assets undergo subsequent measurement at “amortised cost”.

The risk provisions and thus also the toss allowances for trade receivables are based on the model of expected credit

losses pursuant to IFRS 9.

Regarding trade receivables, the amount recognised depends on the credit risk of the counterparty as at the
measurement date. In this context, a simplified approach based on a default rate and individual loss allowances is applied
(‘lifetime expected credit toss”). Lifetime expected credit loss are the expected credit loss (“ECL”) that result from all

possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument.

The maximum period considered when estimating ECL is the maximum contractual period over which the Company is
exposed to credit risk.

The Company considers a financial asset to be individually impaired if it is improbable that the debtor will be able to
pay their credit obligation in full without measures such as the utilisation of collateral (if available) being taken.

The Company derecognises financial assets if the contractual rights relating to the cash flows from the financial asset
expire or it transfers the rights to receive the cash flows as part of a transaction in which alt material risks and
opportunities relating to ownership of the financial assets are transferred or collectability can no longer be anticipated.

The present value of lease liabilities has been determined based on the future leasing instalments to be paid over the
remaining term of the lease. A term-based, risk-free interest rate plus a margin has been used as the incremental

borrowing rate for discounting.

LIBF Limited leases buildings and IT equipment (printers, copy machines etc.). The real estate lease agreements
primarily relate to the premises for university operations and administrative buildings.

The IFRS real estate lease agreements for 7th and 8th Floor Peninsula House have fixed contractual terms of 5 years
which commenced in August 2023. The Company recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability in its accounts at the
start of the use transfer. The right-of-use asset is written down on a scheduled basis using the straight-line method either
over the term of the lease or the useful life of the assets depending on which term is shorter. Furthermore, if indications to
do so exist, loss allowances are recognised for the right-of-use asset and the lease liability is adjusted for certain
remeasurements of the lease liability.

LIBF | 15

The lease liability is recognised at the present value of future leasing payments. Discounting is carried out at the
interest rate underlying the lease or, if this cannot be determined, at the incremental borrowing rate that is specific to the
lessee.

The leasing payments that are incorporated into the calculation of the lease liability include:

* — fixed payments,

* variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate at the start
of the use transfer,

* the amount that is expected under a residual value guarantee, and

* the exercise price of a purchase option if it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised, lease payments
of an extension option if it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised and payments of penalties for
the early termination of the lease if it is reasonably certain that this will be done.

Lease fiabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. They are remeasured if a change
in the index or rate results in a change in the amount of leasing payments, if the estimation of the anticipated amount from
the utilisation of a residual value guarantee changes or if the Company changes its assessment regarding the exercising of a
purchase option, extension option or an early termination option

Where a lease liability is remeasured in accordance with the above, the adjustment is taken to the right-of-use asset
in the first instance. The Company does not recognise any right-of-use assets or lease liabilities for short-term leases
(s12 months} and leases for leased objects of low value. The Company recognises the expenses for these leases on a
straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company makes use of the portfolio accounting option. Some leases have both
lease components and non-lease components. The Company has exercised the option to treat these contracts as leases.

In 2023, IFRS 16 resulted in the following effects on the statement of comprehensive income. i

Cash and bank balances are measured at fair value. Cash flows comprise increases or decreases in cash. Cash includes
cash in hand and deposits but excludes cash held as part of the investment portfolio.

The Company's defined benefit pension plan is for current and former employees in the United Kingdom and is
established and operated under the regulatory framework outlined in the Finance Act 2004 and the Occupational Pension
Schemes (Funding and Investment} Regulations 2004 (as amended). These regulations, among other things, set minimum
funding requirements for the plan and may impose restrictions an the investment of plan assets (known as asset ceiling
limitations).

The calculation of provisions for pensions is based on the project unit credit method in accordance with |AS 19, The
net obligation of the Company regarding the existing defined benefit liability is calculated by discounting the estimated
future benefits that the eligible past employee earned in earlier periods. The calculation of the defined benefit obligations
is carried out annually by an accredited actuary using the internationally commonplace projected unit credit method.
Conversely, the pension scheme assets are valued at market rate. Pension fund deficits are recognised in the balance
sheet, but surpluses are not recognised as assets where they cannot be recovered either through a refund from the
scheme or reductions in future benefits.

The plan exposes the Company to the risk of unexpected changes in employee demographics or investment
performance, as well as potential limitations imposed by the UK regulatory framework on our ability ta manage these risks

LIBF | 16

Due to the size of the plan, there is concentration of demographic risk where three former senior managers of the
Company account for approximately 10% of the plan’s defined benefit liability.

As at 31 December 2023, the duration of the fund was 13 years. The contributions to the plan for the year to 31
December 2024 are expected to be nil. Approximately 40% of the Plan’s members are currently in receipt of a pension and
the remaining members are not yet retired. The liability weighted average age of current pensioners is approximately 72
years and the weighted average age of members not yet retired is approximately 55 years. The youngest member is
expected to retire in 2047, at which point the benefits of all members will be in payment. Further details on the plan are
outlined in Note 20.

IFRS 9 stipulates the requirements regarding the recognition and measurement of financial liabilities and essentially
contains the following categories for the classification of financial liabilities: those measured at amortised cost and those

measured at fair value with changes through profit or joss.

A financial liability is measured at fair value with value changes through profit or loss if it is classified as held for
trading, it is a derivative or is designated as such upon initial recognition. Other financial liabilities are measured at
amortised cost using the effective interest method. The financial liabilities of LIBF Limited are initially recognised on the
settlement date when the Company becomes a contractual party under the contractual terms of the financial instrument

concerned.

Interest expenses of financial liabilities are recognised through profit or loss in net financial income/loss. Financial
liabilities are derecognised if the contractual obligations have been settled, have been cancelled or expired. No offsetting
of financial assets and financial liabilities is carried out because the required conditions have not been met. Financial assets
and liabilities are only offset and disclosed as netted in the statement of financial position if the Company has a current
enforceable right to offset the amounts recognised against each other and it is intended either to settle them on a net
basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. These necessary conditions have not been met.
Therefore, no offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities has been carried out.

Preparation of the financial statements requires management to make significant judgments and estimates. The
items in the financial statements where these judgments and estimates have been made include:

Defined benefit scheme — management's estimate of the scheme is based on a number of critical underlying assumptions
such as rates of inflation, mortality and the investment returns of the scheme. The assumptions are reviewed annually with
a qualified actuary.

Useful lives of depreciable assets - management reviews its estimate of the useful lives of depreciable assets at each
reporting date. Uncertainties in these estimates relate to changes in the useful tives of certain software and IT hardware as
well as the useful life and value of the building that LIBF Limited owns.

Acquisition accounting — we measure acquisition costs using fair value estimates. This requires significant judgement about
the future economic benefits of the acquired assets and liabilities, relying on assumptions about market participant
expectations.

Goodwill - we estimate the goodwill based on the future cash flows expected from the acquired entity. This process
involves significant judgements in determining the discount rate and the assumptions used in the valuation model.
Goodwill is subject to impairment testing at least annually, or more frequently if there are indications of potential
impairment.

The Company manages capital to maximise shareholder value through sustainable growth and profitability. We aim
to maintain a healthy capital structure, optimise return on capital, and ensure sufficient liquidity. While we face no
external capital requirements, we adhere to sound financial practices to ensure long-term health and create shareholder
value.

STATUTORY AUDITOR'S REPORT TO THE GENERAL SHAREHOLDERS’ MEETING OF
IU GROUP NV ON THE CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED
31 DECEMBER 2023

We present to you our statutory auditor’s report in the context of our statutory audit of the consolidated
accounts of IU Group NV (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (jointly “the Group”). This report
includes our report on the consolidated accounts, as well as the other legal and regulatory
requirements. This forms part of an integrated whole and is indivisible. This report follows our report
of default prepared on 12 June 2024, in the absence of any annual accounts having been prepared
within the legal deadline.

We have been appointed as statutory auditor by the general meeting d.d. 5 July 2021, following the
proposal formulated by the board of directors. Our mandate will expire on the date of the general
meeting which will deliberate on the annual accounts for the year ended 31 December 2023. We have
performed the statutory audit of the Company's consolidated accounts for 3 consecutive years.

Report on the consolidated accounts
Unqualified opinion

We have performed the statutory audit of the Group's consolidated accounts, which comprise the
consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2023, the consolidated statement of
profit or loss and other comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and
the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated
financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory
information, and which is characterised by a consolidated statement of financial position total of
EUR'000 568.313 and a consolidated loss for the year of EUR’000 44.745.

In our opinion, the consolidated accounts give a true and fair view of the Group’s net equity and
consolidated financial position as at 31 December 2023, and of its consolidated financial performance
and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and with the legal and regulatory
requirements applicable in Belgium.

Basis for unqualified opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) as applicable in
Belgium. Furthermore, we have applied the International Standards on Auditing as approved by the
IAASB which are applicable to the year-end and which are not yet approved at the national level. Our
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the “Statutory auditor's responsibilities
for the audit of the consolidated accounts” section of our report. We have fulfilled our ethical
responsibilities in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the
consolidated accounts in Belgium, including the requirements related to independence.

We have obtained from the board of directors and Company officials the explanations and information
necessary for performing our audit.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
for our opinion.

Responsibilities of the board of directors for the preparation of the consolidated accounts

The board of directors is responsible for the preparation of consolidated accounts that give a true and
fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European
Union and with the legal and regulatory requirements applicable in Belgium, and for such internal
control as the board of directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated
accounts that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated accounts, the board of directors is responsible for assessing the Group’s
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and
using the going concern basis of accounting unless the board of directors either intends to liquidate
the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Statutory auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated accounts

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consclidated accounts as a
whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's
report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users
taken on the basis of these consolidated accounts.

In performing our audit, we comply with the legal, regulatory and normative framework applicable to
the audit of the consolidated accounts in Belgium. A statutory audit does not provide any assurance as
to the Group’s future viability nor as to the efficiency or effectiveness of the board of directors’ current
or future business management at Group level. Our responsibilities in respect of the use of the going
concern basis of accounting by the board of directors’ are described below.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain
professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

« Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated accounts, whether due
to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit
evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not
detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error,
as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override
of internal control:

+ Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
Opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control;

+ Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates and related disclosures made by the board of directors:

20f4

FREE TRANSLATION

+ Conclude on the appropriateness of the board of directors’ use of the going concem basis of
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists
related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue
as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw
attention in our statutory auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated accounts
or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the
audit evidence obtained up to the date of our statutory auditor's report. However, future events or
conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern:

« Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated accounts, including
the disclosures, and whether the consolidated accounts represent the underlying transactions
and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation;

+ Obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities
or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial
statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group
audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the board of directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control
that we identify during our audit.

Other legal and regulatory requirements
Responsibilities of the board of directors

The board of directors is responsible for the preparation and the content of the directors’ report on the
consolidated accounts.

Statutory auditor’s responsibilities

In the context of our engagement and in accordance with the Belgian standard which is
complementary to the International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) as applicable in Belgium, our
responsibility is to verify, in all material respects, the directors’ report on the consolidated accounts
and to report on this matter.

Aspects related to the directors’ report on the consolidated accounts

In our opinion, after having performed specific procedures in relation to the directors’ report
(management report) on the consolidated accounts, this directors’ report is consistent with the
consolidated accounts for the year under audit and is prepared in accordance with article 3:32 of the
Companies’ and Associations’ Code.

In the context of our audit of the consolidated accounts, we are also responsible for considering, in
particular based on the knowledge acquired resulting from the audit, whether the directors’ report
(management report) on the consolidated accounts is materially misstated or contains information
which is inadequately disclosed or otherwise misleading. In light of the procedures we have
performed, there are no material misstatements we have to report to you.

Statement related to independence

« Our registered audit firm and our network did not provide services which are incompatible with the
Statutory audit of the consolidated accounts, and our registered audit firm remained independent
of the Group in the course of our mandate.

e The fees for additional services which are compatible with the statutory audit of the consolidated
accounts referred to in article 3:65 of the Companies’ and Associations’ Code are correctly
disclosed and itemized in the notes to the consolidated accounts.

for at fair value. The relevant description is provided under the respective accounting policies.

Historical costs are generally based on the fair value of the consideration provided in exchange for the
asset.

The material accounting policies are described in the following sections

Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements as at 12/31/2023 include IU Group N.V., as the parent company,
and all entities of material importance that are directly or indirectly controlled by the parent company. No
participations are held in any structured entities. A voting right majority amounting to 100% exists in the case
of all consolidated subsidiaries, i.e. there are no non-controlling shareholders.

Control exists if |U Group N.V.:

@ can exercise power over the investee,
® is exposed to variable returns from its involvement, and
® can influence the amount of the returns due to its power over the investee.

The company reassess whether or not it controls an investee, if facts and circumstances indicate that
one or more of the aforementioned three criteria of control have changed.

Subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which the Company
gains control over the subsidiary until the date on which the central held by the Company ends. In this
context, the results of any subsidiary acquired or sold during the year are recognized in the statement of
profit or loss and the other consolidated comprehensive income/loss according to the actual date of
acquisition and/or actual date of disposal.

To the extent necessary, the annual financial statements of the subsidiaries are adjusted to align the
accounting policies with the methods applied within the Group.

All intragroup assets, liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions
between Group entities are completely eliminated as part of consolidation.

The acquisition of businesses is accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of a business
combination is stated as the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of acquisition, of the assets transferred,
liabilities incurred or assumed, and any equity instruments issued in exchange for control of the acquiree. it
also contains the fair value of assets and liabilities resulting from contingent consideration contracts
Acquisition-related costs are recognized through profit or loss as incurred.

The identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at their fair values. The following
exceptions exist:

e Deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities, as well as assets and liabilities relating to employee
benefit arrangements, are recognized and measured in accordance with 1AS 12 Income Taxes and
IAS 19 Employee Benefits, and

° Liabitities and equity instruments relating to share-based payments or the replacement of share-
based payments by the Group are measured at their acquisition date in accordance with IFRS 2
Share-based Payment.

Goodwill is measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred, the amount of
any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the equity share in the acquiree previously
held by the acquirer (if available) over the net of the acquisition-date fair value of the identifiable assets
acquired and liabilities assumed. In the event of a negative difference — even after reassessment — the
resulting gain is recognized directly through profit or loss.

{f the initial accounting for a business combination is not yet complete at the end of a financial year, the
Company states provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete.

If new information that provides clarity about circumstances as at the acquisition date becomes known
within the measurement period, the provisional amounts recognized are corrected and, where necessary,
additional assets and liabilities are recognized.

4.3. Foreign currency translation

Foreign currency transactions of 1U Group are generally translated at the closing exchange rate as of
transaction date. Monetary items denominated in foreign currencies (e.g. liquid assets, receivables,
liabilities) are subsequently translated at the respective closing exchange rates and any translation
differences in the reporting period or from previous financial statements are recognized in the income
statement through profit or loss. Non-monetary items valued at historical cost continue to be translated at
historical exchange rates. The historical exchange rate equals the exchange rate as of the item's first-time
recognition.

Separate financial statements in a foreign currency are translated according to the functional currency
approach under IAS 21 in application of the modified closing rate method. The assets and liabilities of the
consolidated foreign entities, ail of which are financially and economically independent as well as
independently organized. are translated at the closing exchange rate of the reparting date while expenses
and income are translated at average annual exchange rates and equity items are translated at historical
exchange rates. Translation differences are recognized in equity outside profit or loss and recognized in
other comprehensive income

CAD 1.46 1.46

Revenue recognition

IFRS 15 sets out a comprehensive framework for determining whether, in what amount and at which
date revenue is to be recognized.

According to IFRS 15, such recognition of revenue takes place when control over a product or service
is transferred to the customer. Judgments must be made to determine whether control is transferred based
on a specific time or period.

Sales are measured based on the consideration stipulated in a contract with each customer. The Group
recognizes revenues when it transfers control over a good or service to a customer. Further descriptions
regarding the type and date of the fulfillment of performance obligations from contracts with customers,
including the significant payment terms and the associated principles of revenue recognition, are provided
in note 5.

in addition, assets result from costs to obtain a contract and these have been capitalized in the amount
of the directly attributable costs. These are amortized over the terms of the contracts on a straight-line basis.

in addition to the revenues pursuant to IFRS 15, the Group generates revenues within the meaning of
IFRS 16 that results primarily from the leasing of student accommodation. In all cases, this relates to
operating lease contracts for which revenue is collected on a straight-line basis.

income taxes
Current taxes

Current taxes are determined based on the respective tax results and recognized to the extent that they
will probably be recognized for tax purposes. If uncertainties regarding such recognition exist, tax liabilities
are recognized in the amount of the best possible estimate of the anticipated tax payment. The inclusion of
tax liabilities from uncertain tax items in accounting only takes place if their realization is probable. The
assumptions and decisions made are reviewed at each reporting date and, where necessary, adjusted based
on any new knowledge gained.

Deferred taxes

Deferred taxes are recognized due to temporary differences between the amounts recognized in the
respective tax accounts at national level and the IFRS accounts incorporated into the consolidated financial
statements, due to consolidation processes as well as for tax loss carryforwards. Calculations are made
according to the liability method of IAS 12.

For the assessment of the recoverability of the deferred tax assets, an assessment is made regarding
the extent to which realization is sufficiently probable and whether sufficient convincing substantive indicators
can be demonstrated.

Whether the deferred tax assets can actually be realized depends on whether a sufficient level of tax
income can be generated in future against which the temporary differences and tax loss carryforwards can
be offset. In this context, existing taxable temporary differences or corporate planning are drawn upon. If
utilization cannot be expected, then corresponding loss allowances are recognized

The assumptions made here regarding the future taxable income available for the utilization of deferred
tax assets are nevertheless subject to uncertainties. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are netted if a legally

46

enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities exists and if the deferred taxes
relate to income taxes that are levied by the same tax authority

Intangible assets

The following useful lives are generally assumed for the calculation of amortization:

® Computer software 3-~ 13 years
® Capitalized development costs 2~5 years

@ Licenses 2-10 years
@ Brand names 5 ~ 18 years
® Course program content 4~13 years
@ Student base 2~10 years

Separately acquired intangible assets

Separately acquired, i.e., not as part of a business combination, intangible assets with a definable useful
life are recognized at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses. Amortization Is recognized
through expenses on a straight-line basis over the useful life of the assets. Expected useful lives and the
methods of amortization are reviewed at each reporting date and all changes in estimates are taken into
consideration prospectively.

Separately acquired intangible assets with indefinite useful lives do not exist within the Group.
Goodwill

The goodwill resulting from a business combination is recognized at cost less, where necessary,
impairment losses and stated separately in the consolidated statement of financial position

For the purposes of the impairment test, goodwill is divided into those cash-generating units (or groups
thereof) of the Group from which it is expected that it will be possible to benefit from the synergy effects of
the business combination. The Group has four cash-generating units during the financial year. Details are
provided on this in note 14.

Cash-generating units that have been allocated some part of the goodwill must be tested for impairment
at least once per year. If indications for the impairment of a unit exist, it may be necessary to carry out
impairment tests more regularly. ifthe recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is less than the carrying
amount of the unit, the impairment lass is initially attributed to the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated
to that unit and then attriouted proportionately to the other assets based on the carrying amounts of each
and every asset in proportion to the total carrying amount of the assets within the unit. In this context, the
recoverable amount is the higher value from the value in use and fair value less costs of disposal.

Allimpairment losses to goodwill are recognized directly in the statement of profit or loss. An impairment
lass recognized for goodwill cannot be reversed in a subsequent period.

For the sale of a cash-generating unit, the attriputable amount of goodwill is taken into consideration
when determining the disposal gains or losses.

internally generated intangible assets

(nternally generated intangible assets that result from development activities or the development phase
of an internal project are accounted for once the following evidence is present:

° The completion of intangible assets is realizable from a technical standpoint such that it will be
available for use or for sale.

There is an intention to camplete the intangible asset and to use or sell it.

There is an ability to use or sell the intangible asset.

The intangible asset is expected to result in a future economic benefit.

Adequate technical, financial and other resources are available to be able to complete the
development and to use ar sell the intangible asset.

ovee

10

e There is an ability to determine reliably the attributable costs that arise in the course of developing
the intangible asset.

The amount at which an internally generated intangible asset is recognized for the first time is the total
of the expenses that have arisen since the date on which the intangible asset fulfilled the aforementioned
conditions for the first time. If an internally generated intangible asset cannot be capitalized or if no intangible
asset exists yet, the development costs are recognized through profit or loss in the period in which they arise.

In the subsequent periods, internally generated intangible assets are, exactly as is the case with
acquired intangible assets, measured at cost jess accumulated amortization and impairment losses.
Capitalized development costs in the Group are amortized on a straight-line basis over a useful life of 2 to 5
years.

Intangible assets acquired in the course of a business combination

Intangible assets that have been acquired in the course of a business combination, e.g., brand names,
accreditations, customer relationships and the study content of courses and modules, are recognized
separately from intangible assets and measured at their fair value at the acquisition date. In the subsequent
periods, intangible assets that were acquired in the course of a business combination are measured at cost
fess accumulated amortization and any impairment losses.

Because of the expected benefit of the brand name “IU” (former: “IUBH”) held within the Group and due
to its strong reputation for high-quality education, the intangible asset of this brand name has an indefinite
useful life. Furthermore, the accreditation assets also have an indefinite useful life.

The brand name “IU” and accreditations have an indefinite useful life and are therefore not written down
on a straight-line basis and instead undergo regular impairment testing. The Group regularly invests in these
assets by means of marketing and quality assurance to maintain or increase their value. Accreditations, in
particular, serve as the basis for the licensing of higher education institutions.

Derecognition of intangible assets

Intangible assets have to be derecognized upon disposal or if na economic benefit can be expected
from their use or disposal. The gain or loss from the derecognition of an intangible asset, measured as the
difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset, is recognized in the
statement of profit or loss at the date of derecognition. Items are reported under other income or other
expenses.

4.7 Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment is disclosed at cost less accumulated depreciation and recognized
impairment losses. Depreciation is carried out such that the cost of assets is amortized on a straight-line
basis over their useful life. The expected useful life, residual values and depreciation methods are reviewed
on each reporting date. All necessary changes in estimates are taken into consideration prospectively. The
following economic useful lives for material assets serve as the basis for determining the depreciation of
property, plant and equipment:

@ iT equipment 2-10 years
@ Other equipment 2-20 years
@ = Library equipment 4-13 years
® Cars and other means of transport 5-8 years

@ Buildings 20 — 50 years
@ = Right-of-use assets of cars 2-6 years

® Right-of-use assets of other office 3-6 years

equipment
@ = Right-of-use assets of buildings 2-13 years

Items of property, plant and equipment are derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic
benefit is expected from the continued use of the asset. The gain or loss from the sale or retirement of

11

4.8

4.9

property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the disposal proceeds and the
carrying amount of the asset and is recognized in the statement of profit or loss.

[Investment property

investment property is real estate property or parts thereof that are primarily held in order to generate
rental income or for increases in capital. Investment property is accounted for in accordance with the cost
model, i.e., measured at cast less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Unleased property is additionally adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability resulting from a new
assessment or change in leasing conditions.

The Group does not own any reai estate property of its own. it has nevertheless leased premises at
multiple locations in order to operate the higher education institution. Due to the growth strategy pursued,
significantly larger spaces were often leased than the current demand requires to have space for growth. In
order ta minimize temporary vacancies, these spaces are usually temporarily sub-leased. These sub-leased
spaces must therefore be disclosed as investment property.

Each gain or loss from the disposal of investment property (calculated as the difference between the net
disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the item) is recognized in profit or loss under other income or
other expenses

Rental income from investment property is recognized as other income on a straight-line basis over the
lease period. Any rent incentives granted are recognized as a component of the total rental income over the
lease period.

Impairments of investment property, right-of-use assets and property, plant and
equipment as well as intangible assets

At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of the investment property, the right-of-
use assets and property, plant and equipment as well as intangible assets in order to determine whether
there are any indications of an impairment of these assets. If any such indications are identifiable, the
recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the potential impairment
loss. If the recoverable amount of an individual asset cannot be estimated, the estimation of the recoverable
amount is made based on the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.

In the case of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and those that are unavailable for use, an
impairment test is carried out at least once per year and whenever there is an indicatian of any impairment
triggering event.

The recoverable amount is the higher of the asset's fair value less costs of disposal and the value in
use. When determining the value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted at the weighted
average cost of capital (WACC). This discounting rate is a pre-tax figure of 9.96% for the B2C DACH Core
CGU, 9.91% for the B2C DACH Other CGU, 9.62% for the B2C International CGU and 9.93% for the On
Campus CGU (prior year for B2C: 11.42% and for B2B: 11.33%) that has been estimated on the basis of
the sector's historical average weighted capital costs and at a risk-free rate of 2.75%.

if the estimated recoverable amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit falis below its carrying amount,
the carrying amount of the asset or a cash-generating unit is reduced to the recoverable amount.

If the impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or a cash-generating unit
or of the cash-generating unit is increased to the most recent estimate of the recoverable amount. In this
context, the increase in net assets is limited to the value that would have resulted if no impairment loss had
been recognized for the asset or a cash-generating unit in the prior years By contrast, no goadwill is written
up.

Impairments on investment property. right-of-use assets. property, plant and equipment and intangible
assets are recognized under the item ‘Amortization/depreciation” in the consolidated statement of
comprehensive income

12

Non-financial assets other than goodwill that suffered an impairment are reviewed for a possible reversal
of the impairment at the end of each reporting period

4.10 Inventories

Inventories primarily contain licenses for students, teaching materials and inventories for the canteen.
They are recognized at cost. Due to their subordinate importance for the consolidated financial statements,
no write-downs are recognized at the reporting date.

4.11 Financial assets

IFRS 9 stipulates the requirements regarding the recognition and measurement of financial assets and
contains three basic categories for the classification of financial assets: those measured at amortized cost
(AC), those measured at fair value with changes through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) and those
measured at fair value with changes through profit or loss (FVTPL).

The classification of financial assets pursuant to IFRS 9 is carried out based on the business model of
the Company for managing financial assets and the characteristics of the cash flows. Trade receivables are
recognized from the date on which they arise onwards.

The financial assets of the |U Group consist of loans to related parties, trade receivables, ather assets
and cash. Finance lease receivables are disclosed under other non-current/current assets (see note 4.10).

The financial assets of the i{U Group are initially recognized on the trade date if the Company becomes
a contractual party under the contractual terms of the financial instrument. The amount recognized here is
the settlement amount

The joans to related parties are initially measured at fair value. The trade receivables of |U Group da
not have any significant financing component and are therefore measured at transaction price upon initial
recognition. Cash is measured at fair value.

Trade receivables are not sold and are usually recovered by the Company itself. In addition, the
underlying contracts contain exclusively the claim for the payment of the receivable and fulfill the
requirements for “standard cash flow conditions”. For these reasons, the trade receivables undergo
subsequent measurement within the “amortized cost’ category. Both cash and other assets undergo
subsequent measurement at “amortized cost”.

The risk provisions and thus also the loss allowances for trade receivables are based on the model of
expected credit losses pursuant to IFRS 9

With regard to trade receivables, the amount recognized depends on the credit risk of the counterparty
as at the measurement date. In this context, a simplified approach based on a default rate and individual
loss allowances is applied (‘lifetine expected credit loss”). Lifetine expected credit loss is the ECL that result
from all possible default events over the expected life of a financia! instrument.

The maximum period considered when estimating ECL is the maximum contractual period over which
the Group is exposed to credit risk

The Group considers a financiat asset to be individually impaired if it is improbable that the debtor will
be able to pay their credit obligation in full without measures such as the utilization of collateral (if available)
being taken.

The Group derecognizes financial assets if the contractual rights relating to the cash flows from the
financial asset expire or it transfers the rights to receive the cash flows as part of a transaction in which all
materia! risks and opportunities relating to ownership of the financial assets are transferred or collectability
can no longer be anticipated.

No offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities is carried out because the required conditions
have not been met. Financial assets and liabilities are only offset and disclosed as netted in the statement
of financial position if the Group has a current enforceable right to offset the amounts recognized against
each other and it is intended either to settle them on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability

13

simultaneously. These necessary conditions have not been met. Therefore, no offsetting of financial assets
and financial liabilities has been carried out.

4.12 Government grants

Government grants relating to assets are initially recognized as deferred income at fair value as soon
as it is reasonably certain that they can be awarded, and the Group will fulfil the conditions relating to the
grant. Subsequently, these other government grants are recognized on a scheduled basis as other income
in the statement of profit or loss

Grants that compensate the Group for expenses incurred are recognized on a scheduled basis in the
periods in which the expenses are recognized as other income (see note 7) or personnel expenses (see
note 9) in the statement of profit or loss.

4.13 Leases

The present value of lease liabilities has been determined on the basis of the future leasing installments
to be paid over the remaining term of the lease. A term-based, risk-free interest rate plus 4 margin has been
used as the incremental borrowing rate for discounting. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities have not
been recognized for those leases with a remaining term of 12 months or less or for leased objects of low
value

Leases under which the Group fs lessee

\U Group leases buildings, cars and other assets (printers, copy machines etc.). The real estate lease
agreements primarily relate to the premises for university operations (lecture halls, cafeterias etc.),
administrative buildings, parking spaces and student residences.

The real estate lease agreements initially have a fixed contractual term of 2 to 13 years which are
extended by additional periods of 1 to 10 years by way of extension options that can be exercised unilaterally
by IU Group. Furthermore, for some real estate lease agreements, IU Group has the right to exercise an
early termination option. IU Group recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability in its accounts at the
start of the use transfer. The extension options that can be exercised unilaterally by IU Group are not included
in the accounting for leases under which the Group is lessee because the Group currently does not believe
that these options will be exercised

The right-of-use asset is written down on a scheduled basis using the straight-line method either over
the term of the lease or the useful life of the assets depending on which term is shorter. Furthermore, if
indications to do so exist, loss allowances are recognized for the right-of-use asset and the lease liability is
adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.

The lease liability is recognized at the present value of future leasing payments. Discounting is carried
out at the interest rate underlying the lease or, if this cannot be determined, at the incremental borrowing
rate that is specific to the lessee.

The leasing payments that are incorporated into the calculation of the lease liability include:

® fixed payments,

*® variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or
rate at the start of the use transfer,
the amount that is expected under a residual value guarantee. and
the exercise price of a purchase option if it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised,
lease payments of an extension option if it is reasonably certain that the option wi!l be exercised
and payments of penalties for the early termination of the lease if it is reasonably certain that this
will be done.

Lease liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. They are
remeasured if a change in the index or rate results in a change in the amount of leasing payments, if the
estimation of the anticioated amount from the utilization of a residual value guarantee changes or if the Group

14

changes its assessment regarding the exercising of a purchase option, extension option or an early
termination option.

lf a lease liability is remeasured accordingly, the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset is adjusted
analogously. if the lease liability decreases and the amount of the adjustment exceeds the carrying amount
of the right-of-use asset, the adjustment amount that exceeds the carrying amount is to be recagnized
through profit or toss.

IU Group does not recognize any right-of-use assets or lease liabilities for short-term leases (maximum
12 months) and leases for leased objects of low value. The Group recognizes the expenses for these leases
on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Group makes use of the portfolio accounting option. Some
leases have both lease components and non-lease components, especially those for cars. The Group has
exercised the option to treat these contracts as a whole as leases.

The development of right-of-use assets is shown in the fixed asset movement schedule under note 15.

In 2023, IFRS 16 resulted in the following effects on the statement of comprehensive income.

in EUR'000 2023 2022
Depreciation of right-of-use assets 14,835 10,193
Depreciation of right-of-use assets relating to investment property 0 7
Interest expenses on lease liabilities 6,348 4,216
Expenses for short-term leases 736 1,415
Total 22,919 15.831

The total cash outflows for leases arnount to EUR 19,755 thousand in 2023 (prior year: EUR 14,916
thousand).

In the financia! year under review, the Group entered into new lease liabilities amounting to EUR 206
thousand (prior year: EUR 1,198 thousand) that first commence in 2024.

Leases under which the Group is lessor

Within the context of sub-leasing, the Group leases out its own leased buildings and parts of buildings
(individual floors or offices) to unrelated third parties. From a lessor standpoint, there are both sub-leases
that are categorized as finance leases and sub-leases that are categorized as operating leases. Pursuant to
IFRS 16.3, that standard applies to all types of leases, including those entailing right-of-use assets that are
leased on to others within the context of sub-leasing.

Finance leases

In 2023, the Group sub-leased buildings or parts of buildings that are disclosed as right-of-use assets
in property, plant and equipment. The existing finance leases as at 12/31/2023 include lease receivables in
the amount of EUR 2,916 thousand. The leasing out of commercial spaces is not a typical activity for the
Group and therefore the recoverability of the lease receivables is specifically subject to continuous
monitoring to minimize the risk of default.

The sub-leases concerned here relate to the building (sections) used by Steigenberger Akademie and
its subsidiaries. The Steigenberger Akademie Group was sold in the financial year 2019. The lease
agreements for the building (sections) exist with IU Internationale Hochschule GmbH, meaning that sub-
leasing became necessary here. The Steigenberger Akademie Group may, in principle, terminate the sub-
lease agreement early. Nevertheless, due to the highly specific business model of the Steigenberger
Akademie Group, almost no alternative rental properties are available. The management of the IU Group
has determined that, due to the highly specific business model and the lack of alternative rental properties,
the sub-lease agreement for the building sections would typically be maintained until the end of the main
lease agreement. Therefore, despite the anticipated closure of the Steigenberger Akademie's operations as

15

detailed in Note 35, ‘Events after the reporting period’, this sub-lease has been classified as a finance lease
in accordance with IFRS.

In 2023, the Group recognized interest income for lease receivables amounting to EUR 220 thousand
(prior year: EUR 181 thousand).

The table below provides a maturity analysis of the leasing receivables and shows the non-discounted
lease payments that are to be received after the reporting date.

in EUR'000 2023 2022
Less than one year 711 510
One to five years 2,727 2,040
More than five years 0 425
Total amount of undiscounted lease receivables 3,438 2,975
Interest components §22 531
Finance lease receivables 2,916 2,444

Operating leases

The Group leases out its investment property. The Group has categorized these leases as operating
leases because the transfers here have not generally included ali risks and opportunities associated with the
right-of-use assets. Note 17 provides information regarding the operating leases for investment property. In
addition, the student residences and some of the parking spaces leased by the Group serve the purpose of
sub-leasing to students. The rents here are in line with normal market rates.

4.14 Cash and cash equivatents

Cash and bank balances are measured at cost. These include cash on hand, bank balances available
on demand and other current highly liquid financial assets that at their date of acquisition had a maximum
term of three months.

4.45 Share-based payment

These consolidated financial statements contain exclusively share-based payments that are settled
using equity instruments. The Group has no abligation to settle the share-based payments, wherefare they
account for the share-based payment arrangements as an equity-settled plan in accordance with IFRS 2.
The fair value as at the date of granting the share-based payment arrangements to employees is recognized
as expenses with a corresponding increase in equity over the period in which the employees obtain an
unconditional entitiament to the awards. The amount recognized as an expense is adjusted in order to reflect
the number of awards for which the corresponding service conditions and market-independent performance
conditions are fulfilled in accordance with expectations, meaning that the amount ultimately recognized is
based on the number of awards that fulfill the corresponding service conditions and market-independent
performance conditions at the end of the vesting period. For share-based payment awards with non-vesting
conditions, fair value is determined on the date they are granted with such conditions taken into
consideration. No adjustment for the differences between the expected and actual results has to be carried
out

16

4.16 Pension provisions

The Group has pension plans for employees in Germany and United Kingdom. The calculation of
provisions for pensions is based on the projected unit credit method in accordance with IAS 18. The net
obligation of the Group with regard to the existing defined benefit liability is calculated by estimating future
benefits that the eligible past employee earned in earlier periods. This amount is discounted. The calculation
of the defined benefit obligations is carried out annually by an accredited actuary

Remeasurements of the liability from defined benefit plans are generally recognized directly in other
comprehensive income with deferred taxes taken into consideration. The revaluation includes the actuarial
gains and losses from the defined benefit obligation that may result, for example, from differences between
actual trends and measurement assumptions. The Group determines the net interest expenses (income) for
the liability (asset) from defined benefit plans for the reporting period by applying the discounting rate that was
used for the measurement of the defined benefit obligation at the start of the annual reporting period. At this
date, the discounting rate is applied to the net liability (asset) from the defined benefit liabilities. In this context,
account is taken of any changes that arise in the liability (asset) from the defined benefit liabitities during the
period as a result of contribution and benefit payments. For the German Part, no tax effect is considered. This
is because the respective legal entity (hr Team Horst Ruckle GmbH) is not part of the income tax graup and
possesses tax loss carryforwards to be utilized in the future. Therefore, no considerable tax effect is to be
expected

In United Kingdom no tax effect from the OCI is anticipated, as it does not affect either current or deferred tax
positions.

4.17 Other provisions

Provisions are recognized if the Group has a present obligation (jegal! or constructive in nature) arising
from a past event and it is probable that the settlement of the obligation will result in an outflow of resources
and a reliable estimate of the amount of the provision can be made.

The provision amount recognized is the best estimate made as at the reporting date for the payment to
be additionally made in order to settle the current obligation. In this context, risks and uncertainties inherent
to the obligation are to be taken into account. If a provision is measured based on the estimated cash flows
for the settlement of the obligation. these cash flows must be discounted if the interest effect is of material
significance.

If it can be assumed that parts of or all of the economic benefits required for the settlement of the
provision will be reimbursed by an external third party, this claim is capitalized as an asset if the
reimbursement is virtually certain, and the amount concerned can be estimated reliably.

A liability for payments caused by the termination of an employment relationship is recognized if the
Group can no Songer withdraw the offer of such payments or, if earlier, the Group has recognized the
associated costs for restructuring.

4.18 Financial liabilities

IFRS 9 stipulates the requirements regarding the recognition and measurement of financial liabilities
and essentially contains the following categories for the classification of financial liabilities: those measured
at amortized cost and those measured at fair value with changes through profit or loss.

A financial liability is measured at fair vatue with value changes through profit or loss if itis classified as
held for trading, it is a derivative or is designated as such upon initial recognition. Other financial liabilities
are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.

The financial liabilities of the IU Group are initially recognized on the settlement date when the Company
becomes a contractual party under the contractual terms of the financial instrument concerned.

The financial liabilities of the IU Group consist exclusively of primary financial instruments.

17

These are recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position of |\U Group at the date when
the contractual obligation arises to transfer cash or other financial assets to another party. The financial
liabilities belong to the “amortized cost” category and are measured at their repayment amount or at
amortized cost using the effective interest method. In the case of liabilities with a term of less than one year,
it is assumed that the fair value corresponds to the repayment value. Non-interest-bearing liabilities with a
term of more than one year do not exist in the case of {U Group. Directly attriputable transaction costs are
also recognized for liabitities and amortized over their contractual term using the effective interest method.

interest expenses of financial liabilities are recognized through profit or loss in net financial income/loss.

Financial liabilities are derecognized if the contractual obligations have been settled, have been
canceled or expired.

No offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities is carried out because the required conditions
have not been met. Financial assets and liabilities are only offset and disclosed as netted in the statement
of financial position if the Group has a current enforceable right to offset the amounts recognized against
each other and it is intended either to settle them on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability
simultaneously. These necessary conditions have not been met Therefore, no offsetting of financial assets
and financial liabilities has been carried out.

4.19 Other liabilities

This item primarily includes tax liabilities, advance payments received and jiabilities to employees that
do not constitute financial liabilities within the meaning of IAS 32. The other liabilities are recognized at their
settlement amount.

4.20 Use of judgments and estimates

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires the executive directors to make
judgments and estimates that affect the application of accounting policies and the disclosed amounts of
assets. liabilities, income and expenses. Actual events may differ from these estimates.

Judgments

Information about judgments made in the application of those accounting policies that most materially
influence the amounts recognized in the financiat statements are contained in the following notes.

Determining fair values

A number of the Group’s accounting policies and disclosures require the fair values of financial assets
and liabilities as well as non-financial assets and liabilities to be determined.

When determining the fair value of an asset or liability, the Group uses observable market data to the
greatest degree possible. In this context, the Group takes into account certain characteristics of the asset or
the liability (such as condition and location of the asset or limitations of sale and use) if market participants
would also take these characteristics into account when determining the price for the acquisition of the
Tespective asset or transferring the Siability as at the reporting date. In these consolidated financial
statements, the fair value for the measurement and/or disclosure requirements is determined exclusively on
this basis.

Excluded from this are:

Share-based payments within the scope of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment
Leases within the scope of IFRS 16 Leases

Measurement standards that are similar to fair value but that are not equivalent to it, such as net
realizable value in IAS 2 Inventories or value in use in IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.

Based on the input factors used in the measurement techniques, the fair values are categorized into
various levels within the fair value hierarchy

@ = Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) on active markets for identical assets and liabilities
Level 2: Measurement parameters that do not entail the quoted prices taken into consideration in
level 1 but which can nevertheless be observed directly (i.e. as a price) or indirectly (derivation of
prices)

e Level 3: Measurement parameters for assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market
data

If the input factors used for determining the fair value of an asset or a liability can be categorized into
differing levels of the fair value hierarchy, the measurement at fair value is assigned in its entirety to the
same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is of material significance to the entire
measurement.

The Group recognizes transfers between the different levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the
reporting period in which the change occurred

Additional information regarding the assumptions for determining the fair values is contained in the
following notes:

Note 14: Goodwill
Note 3: Business Combinations
Note 23: Share-based payment arrangements

Note 26: Pension provisions

The following table provides an overview of assets from costs to obtain a contract, trade receivables,
assets resulting from contracts with customers and liabilities resulting from contracts with customers.

Assets from costs to obtain a contract 5,567 5,741
Trade receivables 61,974 37,660
Contract liabilities 126,354 85,158

Contract liabilities relate to tuition fees that are realized as revenue over a certain period. The students
can decide in advance whether the semester fees will be charged to them in advance of each month,
semester or year. Tuition fees paid in advance are accrued over the corresponding period. In addition, the
contractual liabilities contain a revenue deferral for the possibility of a free-of-charge contract extension by
the students primarily in distance learning. The measurement is based on a factor calculated by dividing the
ratio of ECTS credits earned during the standard period of study by the percentage of revenue recognized
at the same time. The factor used is based on the experience of previous periods.

The revenue recognized in 2023 contains no revenues from performance obligations fulfilled in earlier

periods.

Assets from costs to obtain a contract amount to EUR 5,567 thousand (prior year: EUR 5,741 thousand).
These result from the Group grants commissions to employees and free agents for student placements. For
mere information, please refer to note 18.

Performance obligations and methods of revenue recognition

Sales are measured based on the consideration stipulated in a contract with each customer. The Group
recognizes revenues when it transfers control over a good or service to a customer. Further information
regarding the type and date of the fulfiliment of performance obligations from contracts with customers,
including the significant payment terms and the associated principles of revenue recognition, is provided in

the following table:

Distance tearning

This course offering encompasses
bachelor, master and MBA
programs in both German and
English with over 250 degree
programs for a wide range of
sectors and areas of responsibility.

For ontine distance learning,
programs range from 12 to 72
months. For master programs
durations of 12, 24 and 48 months
are possible. The costs for the
courses increase as the duration
increases. Some programs allow
students to make use of a free-of-
charge extension of up to 12
months in order to conclude their
studies. In addition to the monthly
tuition fees, a graduation fee is also
charged.

Because students’ past
performance is accredited for the
exams, price reductions are made
to take this into} account
accordingly.

In general, a monthly payment is
made that is to be paid by the end
of each respective month.
For some courses tuition fees are
invoiced to students 2 to 4 weeks
prior to the commencement of each
term.

Income is generally recognized
over the standard period of study,
with deferred revenues recorded
as liabilities and only recognized
as revenue once performance
obligations are fulfilled.

If a program includes any free-of-
charge extension period, income
is distributed according to past
experience regarding the
accumulation of ECTS points. For
this purpose, a deferral is
recognized during the normal
study duration and disclosed as
deferred income under contract
liabilities. The factor used for the
calculation of the deferred income
is calculated based on historical
values according to the time model
(program duration). In order to
determine the relevant factor for
each program duration (e.g. 12,
24, 36 months), consideration is
given to students who have
already completed their studies,
have discontinued their studies
and who are using the free-of-
charge extension. These factors
are then applied to the current
student population in order to
recognize the deferral that is
recognized under the contractual
liabilities as a deferred income
item.

In 2023, other income from the sale of assets included EUR 5,558 thousand (previous year: EUR 1,454
thousand) from the resale of electronic hardware to business customers, which is not part of ordinary
business activities.

The income of semester tickets was only booked on balance sheet accounts in prior years because of
immaterial amounts. If it had been booked through profit and loss other income would have been higher by
EUR 3,557 thousand in prior year figures.

Other income increased primarily due to the sale of assets and the provision of semester tickets to
students (see also Note 10 Other expenses).

Cost of materials

The cost of materials for the financial year 2023 primarily contains course materials such as scripts,
books and training materials as well as expenses for catering. Furthermore, the cost of purchased services
primarily contains remuneration for guest lecturers.

Wages and salaries 199,911 141,375
Social security and pension benefits 39,703 28,188

Amortization of assets from costs to obtain a contract 6,398 4,485
Total 57,073 43,383

The increase in amortization/depreciation of intangible fixed assets and property, plant and equipment
mainly stems from the amortization of course development costs and self-generated software as well as
depreciation for tablets. For more information on amortization and depreciation, please refer to notes 15, 16
and 18.

Commercial trade expenses 4,886 0
Miscellaneous other expenses 6,822 4,850
Total 172,681 135,611

Until 2022 some software licenses were recorded under telecommunications and IT expenses. As from
2023 they are recorded under licenses and concessions. This explains part of the increase in licenses and
concessions. Moreover, as the Group grows the need in software licenses grows accordingly.

Due to the Group's goal of enlisting more students, the Group has invested in several marketing
campaigns, which is the main reason for the increase in advertising expenses. Additionally, the occupancy
costs have increased due to the growth of the Group.

The other personnel-related expenses primarily contain the external staff, the freelancers and the job
advertisement.

The other expenses also contain costs for purchasing semester tickets for students which are charged
to students and which were booked through balance sheet accounts only in prior years because of immaterial
amounts. If it has been booked through profit and loss other expenses would have been higher by EUR 3,592
thousand in prior year figures (see also Note 7)

In 2023, other expenses included EUR 4,886 thousand (previous year: EUR 0 thousand) under
commercial trade expenses related to the costs associated with the resale of electronic hardware to business
customers (see note 7).

The miscellaneous other expenses primarily contain postage and office costs, insurance policies and
premiums, vehicle costs and bank fees.

Income taxes

The anticipated income tax rate for the IU Group is determined by applying the relevant tax rate for the
group parent company of 32.98%. This consists of the corporation tax of 15.0% plus the solidarity surcharge
of 5.5% on the corporation tax as well as a trade tax amounting to 17.15%.

The revenues and income of material significance within the Group are generated by IU Internationale
Hochschule GmbH. IU Internationale Hochschule is exempted from trade tax pursuant to Section 3 No. 13
of the German Trade Tax Act (Gewerbesteuergesetz — GewStG) because it provides services almost
exclusively as a state-recognized private institution of higher education. The tax effect that results from this
can be ascertained from the tax reconciliation (EUR 10,337 thousand).

The non-deductible expenses consist of non-deductible interest expenses resulting in a tax effect of
EUR 11,751 thousand and unrecognized losses for tax purposes of the current year leading to a tax effect
of EUR 2,317 thousand.

Due to an event leading to a forfeiture of tax loss carry forwards in trade tax and corporate tax according
to section 8c of German Corporate Tax Act (K6rperschaftsteuergesetz) losses and profits within the German
Tax Group cannot be fully offset against each other. The amount of losses which cannot be deducted is
EUR 34,475 thousand leading to a tax effect of EUR 11,370 thousand.

The deferred taxes for temporary differences and tax loss carryforwards recognized at a tax rate of
approximately 17.15% developed as follows during the financial year:

German Tax Group.

For taxable temporary differences in connection with shares in subsidiaries amounting to EUR 15,062
thousand (prior year: EUR 13,181 thousand), no deferred taxes were recognized as at December 31, 2023,
because {U Group N.V. can manage the timing of the reversal and the differences wilf not be reversed in the
foreseeable future.

14. Goodwill

The carrying amount of goodwill as at the reporting date is shown in the following table:

Total 141,593 115,276

Starting with December 1, 2023, the management af the 1U Group has Changed its internal reporting
structure and divided its operating segments from two into four operating segments. This change was mainly
driven by the acauisitions of 2023 and facilitates detailed performance measurement and aligns resources
more closely with the strategic needs of each segment, supporting better transparency and enabling more
effective alignment with evolving corporate goals and leadership structures. The former B2C segment was
divided ints B2C DACH Core. B2C DACH Other and B2C International. The new segment On Campus now
includes the former B2B segment and additionally, the business unit MyStudium DACH (previously in B2C).
The goodwill resulting from the company acquisition of Career Partner GmbH in the financial year 2018 is
allocated to three operating segments on a relative basis using the value in use. The goodwill arising from
the business combinations of The London Institute of Banking and Finance (LIBF) and UC Education Inc.

32

dba University of Fredericton (UFRED) in the financial year 2023 was allocated to the international business
unit, which is now shown in B2C International, with EUR 7,234 thousand from LIBF and EUR 19,083
thousand from UFred, thereof changes from currency translations amounting to EUR 119 thousand and
EUR 69 thousand respectively. There were no changes in goodwill in the previous year, so the ending

balance as of December 31, 2022, was the same as the opening balance.

The recoverable amount of the CGUs respectively the group of CGUs is based on the value-in-use,
which is estimated using discounted cash flows. The key assumptions that have been used to estimate the
recoverable amount are described below. The values assigned to the key assumptions reflect the
assessment of the management regarding future developments in the relevant sectors and are based on

historical values from external and internal sources. There were no changes in previous year figures.

period

* Note: Calculation of growth using the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) is not possible for this period due to
the transition from a negative starting value to a positive ending value. EBIT is planned to increase from approximately
EUR -18,200 thousand in 2023 to EUR 16,000 thousand in 2028.

The discount rate presented in the table above constitutes an after-tax figure, which has been estimated
based on the industry’s historical average capital costs at a debt ratio of 11.9% (prior year: both CGUs:
10.5%) and a market risk premium of 6.75% (prior year: both CGUs: 7.75%). The pre-tax discount rate
amounts to 9.96% (B2C DACH Core), 9.91% (B2C DACH Other), 9.62% (B2C International) and 9.93 %
(On Campus) (prior year: 11.42% (B2C) and 11.33%).

The cash flow forecasts contained specific estimates for the three years 2024 to 2026 and a perpetual
growth rate thereafter. The sustainable growth rate was determined based on the management's estimate
regarding the long-term average annual EBIT growth rates, which matches the assumption that a market
participant would make.

Planned EBIT was determined based on bottom-up planning for each CGU (B2C DACH Core, B2C
DACH Other, B2C International and On Campus) with consideration of the historical growth rates for student
numbers.

The respective recoverable amounts of the CGUs respectively group of CGUs exceed their carrying
amounts. No impairment of goodwill! was therefore necessary.

investment property

As part of its primary operating activities, |U Group leases real estate as a lessee. The part of the real
estate used by IU Group is disclosed in the statement of financial position under property, plant and
equipment while the sub-leased part of the real estate is disclosed under right-of-use assets relating to real
estate held as investment property. These include right-of-use assets of IU Group for real estate that is sub-
leased to third parties as part of operating leasing because the risks and opportunities associated with the
right-of-use assets are not all generally transferred here. Each of the leases initially comprises a non-
cancellable period. Subsequent extensions are negotiated with the lessee. Investment property cannot be
tesold. IU Group maintains the real estate throughout the contractual term in accordance with normal
operational practices.

Rental income amounting to EUR 0 thousand that was recognized within the Group (prior year: EUR 6
thousand) during the financial year is recorded under the other operating income. Direct operating expenses
from the right-of-use assets relating to real estate amounting to EURO thousand (prior year: EURO

The increase in loss allowances is primarily attrioutable to the increase in the gross carrying amount of
the trade receivables.

The trade receivables include accrued revenue of EUR 23,884 thousand (prior year: EUR 15,731
thousand) which has been earned but the invoice has not been issued before the period end.

Impairments of trade receivables exist exclusively in relation to customers. The impairments therefore
relate exclusively to receivables from contracts with customers. For their development, see note 30.

Loss allowances for the trade receivables are determined based on the number of payment reminders
sent to students. Dunning level 1 contains trade receivables that are overdue by a maximum of 30 days.
Dunning level 2 contains receivables that are overdue by a maximum of 60 days. Receivables that are
overdue by a maximum of 90 days are allocated to dunning level 3. After this point, the receivables are

transferred to a debt collection company.

The Group assumes that the risk of a financial asset defaulting significantly increases if it is more than

30 days overdue.

Compared to the prior year, the respective loss ratios have been updated in order to appropriately

represent the actual fulfillment of trade receivables.

23 Share-based payment arrangements
Description of the share-based payment plan (staff share program)

In the context of the roll-over transaction of IU Group N.V. (see note 24), employees of the IU Group
were granted shares in a management holding company on June 16, 2023, meaning that they have been
given an indirect participation in IU Group N.V. As consideration for the sale of shares, the employees paid
a purchase price that was determined based on the Oakley Funds valuation in accordance with the multiplier
method. Within the context of the annual financial statements, a fair value above this amount was determined
based on a Black-Scholes-Merton model in accordance with IFRS 2 principles. As at 12/31/2023, the
participants in this program hold 100% of the shares of the management holding company Guinness Co-
Investment II! GmbH & Co. KG and of the management holding company Guinness Co-Investment !V GmbH
& Co. KG. Guinness Co-Investment Ill GmbH & Co. KG holds 0.15% (key management: 0.083%), Guinness
Co-Investment IV GmbH & Co. KG holds 0.001% (key management: 0.0005%) of the shares in Oakley

Capital Guinness HoldCo S.ar.l..
The issued shares include different classes of shares:

. Ordinary shares: In the event of distributions or liquidation distributions, ordinary shares are treated
as subordinate following the payment of expenses, the repayment of loans with accrued interest
and the remuneration for preference shares (see below). The holders of ordinary shares have a
right to vote at the shareholders’ meeting.

. Preference shares: The preference shares receive advance remuneration of 10% (cumulative) for
invested capital, although the holders of these shares do not receive a right to vote.

41

e Ratchet shares: Subscribers of ratchet shares participate in case of an exit only if a rate of return
of 2.5x is reached. X equals the original investment amount of the investor. Payout of ratchet
shares equals 2.5% of the value above 2.5X, 5% above 3.0X, 7.5% above 3.5X and 10% above
AX. If a participant leaves the group, he will receive the lower of the original investment amount
and the fair market value at the time of departure.

Employees have bought various packages with different compositions of ordinary and ratchet shares.
According to the requirements of the plan, an employee must remain within the Group for a minimum duration
spanning five years in order to participate fully in any increase in value of the shares granted. If the employee
leaves the Group early, the majority snareholder has the right to reacquire the granted ratchet shares at
nominal value or at their lower fair value. Ordinary shares are vesting with 10% per 6 months. The majority
shareholder has the right to acquire ordinary shares of an employee leaving early at nominal value or at their
lower fair value for unvested shares and at fair market value for vested shares if the employee is considered
a good leaver.

If, before this minimum duration expires, the majority of the shares are sold or IU Group N.V. undergoes
an initial public offering (“exit”), this condition no longer applies. The management of IU Group N.V. believes
that a sale is probable. In the event of an early sale of the Company or of one or more of the Group
companies, tag-along rights and drag-along rights exist that provide the investor with the option of obliging
the managers to sell their shares with the sare conditions and, respectively, that provide the managers with
the option of obliging the investor to sell its shares with the same conditions.

IU Group N.V. is not affected by any settlement obligation from the staff share program, meaning that
the share-based payment plan corresponds to settlement through equity instruments.

In the financial year 2023, period expenditure from share-based payment arrangements with settlement
through equity instruments amounting to EUR 13,388 thousand was recognized (prior year: EUR 6,280
thousand).

Shares from the management equity plan from the 2018 transaction structured in the holding company
CPG Co-Investment | GmbH & Ca. KG have been rolled over with the same investment conditions of external
investors, thus no impact on IFRS 2 was generated. The difference between the purchase price and the fair
market value of the 2018 management equity plan has been recognized over the period from 2018 to 2022.

Determining the fair value of the program

The fair value of the newly granted benefits in the financial year 2023 (difference between the fair value
of the shares less purchase price) amounts to EUR 73,668 thousand Fair value is determined on the basis
of a Black-Scholes-Merton model under which al! claims against the assets of the Group (interest-bearing
liabilities, ordinary and preference shares) can be modeled as combinations of (call and put) options and
bonds.

Fair value was determined assuming the following material parameters:

Expected volatility: 40%;

Expected term: 3.0 years;

Expected dividends: 0%;

Risk-free interest rate (based on government bonds): 2.58%

The expected volatility is based on an analysis of the historical volatility of share prices of a group of
comparable listed companies. The expected term is based on previous halding periods of the investor after
a partial sale in the secondary market and a management estimate. Difference between the fair market value
derived from a Monte Carlo Simulation and the purchase price is spread evenly over a period of three years,

These 238,292 new shares have a nominal value of EUR 1.00 each and were issued at a total issue price
of EUR 22,092 Mio, including an issue premium of EUR 21,854 Mio, so that the issue price per share is

As at 12/31/2023, there was an increase in the capital reserve of EUR 13,388 thousand (prior year:
EUR 6,231 thousand) relating to the share-based payment programs.

The net loss from financial year 2023 amounting to EUR 37,150 thousand is, similarly to the net loss
from financial year 2022 of EUR 13,257 thousand, recognized in net retained loss. The other comprehensive
income from the remeasurement of pension obligations amounting to EUR -7,043 thousand (prior year:

The holders of Series A Shares (in prior years: holders of Series C shares as well) are authorized to
vote at the Annual General Meeting, a representative of the indirect beneficiaries of the securities (usually
the CEO) has the right to nominate candidates for a supervisory board mandate, and the holders of Series
C shares have a preference right aver the holders of Series A shares and the holders of Series B shares to
a dividend distribution and a liquidation preference in the event of liquidation

The holders of the Series B shares receive a preference dividend amounting to 10% p.a. of the total
contribution they have made for the respective interests (Series B preference dividend). The total contribution
includes both the amount that was paid in as the initial contribution (i.e. the nominal value of the respective
interest) and the other additional payments made based on shareholders’ resolutions into the capital
reserves of the Company but not, however, shareholder loans. The basis for all dividends is a shareholders’
resolution and a distribution is only made if a profit has been generated.

Any profit that remains after the payment of Series B preference dividends (prior years: and of Series C
dividends) is to be paid out to the holders of Series A shares proportionately to the nominal amounts of the
Series A shares held. Beyond the payment of the preference dividend, the preference shares do not result
in any right to participation in the profit of the Company.

Lease liabilities

The Group leases buildings, cars and other assets (printers, copy machines etc.}. Due to the application
of IFRS 16 in the financial year 2023, these were recognized as right-of-use assets and the resulting lease
liabilities were also disclosed.

Pension provisions

The Group has defined contribution plans in Canada, Germany and United Kingdom, as welt as defined
benefit plans in Germany and United Kingdom.

Defined contribution plans

In Germany the Group makes payments into an external pension fund or another welfare fund through
a Statulury, cumlractual or voluntary model. The company has no obligation to provide further benefits once
it has made these payments, so no provisions are recognized. Expenses for defined contribution plans in
the amount of EUR 1,446 thousand were recognized in the financial year (previous year: EUR 173
thousand).

In Canada the Group provides a defined contribution money purchase pension plan for eligible
employees. The amount of the member's benefit is not determined until the time the benefit is provided. The
Company's responsibility is limited to a matching contribution to a maximum of 4% of gross pay of the
employee and upon retirement the Company has no further responsibility to the plan. Expenses recognized
in the financial year were EUR 35 thousand.

In United Kingdom the Group provides a money purchase (defined contribution) pension scheme for
employees which are invested separately in an independently administered fund. Expenses were recognized
in the financial year of EUR 785 thousand.

Defined benefit plans

The pension obligation for Germany is relating to a former employee and contain the following legal
agreements:

The pension payment, totaling 38% of the 2.2 times the annual salary based on pay scale group 6 of
the Private Banking Sector's Collective Pay Agreement, increases by 2% for the first ten years post-1996
employment, then by 1% per year to a maximum of 75% of the base. It is disbursed in monthly increments,
adjusting based on changes to the measurement basis and supplementary pension incomes

The employee departed the subsidiary on 9/30/2012.

The pension obligation for United Kingdom is relating to 107 employees and contains the foltowing legal
agreements:

45

The acquired benefit entitlements are financed by the employer and employees through a trustee fund.
Employees who are considered as members of the trustee funds pay contributions at 5 per cent of their
pensionable salary. The employer pays the contributions according to the development of the fund and
advice through the actuary.

A lump sum death benefit will be paid by the fund when a member dies within five years, before reaching
normal retirement date or after reaching retirement date but before starting to receive a pension.

GBP 6,000 thousand (EUR 6,806 thousand) paid on 4 April 2023 and half the annual contribution of GBP
100 thousand as this is paid twice yearly to increase the assets. The Group does not recognize the surplus
cover in the balance sheet as at December 31, as LIBF has no unconditional right to reimbursement of the
current excess cover either on termination or on liquidation of the fund.

Amount and maturity of future cash flows

As at December 31, 2023, the duration of the defined benefit obligation for Germany stood at 13.6 years
(prior year: 14.1 years). The prospective amount payable for the non-discounted pension benefits stands at
EUR 46 thousand (prior year: EUR 46 thousand) in a period of up to one year, EUR 215 thousand (prior
year: EUR 210 thousand) in a period of up to five years and EUR 220 thousand (prior year: EUR 208
thousand) in a period of up to six to 10 years. The remaining amounts only become payable after 10 years.

For United Kingdom the prospective amount based on the current schedule of contributions of GBP 100
thousand is expected to be paid annually until 31 July 2026. The duration of the defined benefit obligation
amounts to 13.0 years.

Although the analysis does not take account of the fult distrioution of the planned anticipated cash flows,
it serves as an approximation of the sensitivity of the assumptions presented.

27 ~~ Financial liabilities

Within the context of capital management, the corporate objective of the IU Group consists of both
ensuring continuation as a going concern and increasing company value over the long term. The new and
improved products and services are expected to increase student numbers each year. This increase is
intended to result in an increase in EBITDA and cash flow. The development of intake (new students), drop-
out rates (discontinued studies), the student population, EBITDA, cash flow and the net leverage ratio of the
1U Group are regularly reviewed by the management of |U Group N.V.

As an additiona! condition for growth, the Group must ensure that it can fulfill its financial obligations
and that the key financial figures (covenants) from the loan agreements are adhered to.

The financial liabilities are as follows:

See note 24 for the reconciliation table for lease liabilities.

In order to do so, the Group initially took out a loan amounting to EUR 500,000 thousand (Facility B) in
2021, which was subsequently expanded by EUR 15,000 thousand in 2022 and further increased by
EUR 70,000 thousand in 2023. The Joan is repayable on 12/8/2028. The interest is paid on a quarterly basis
and the rate is Euribor plus 5%. Pursuant to the term and facilities agreement, a negative Euribor interest
rate does not result in a reduction of the interest burden. IU Group makes use of the effective interest method
Effective interest expense for the financial year amounts to EUR 48,655 thousand (prior year: EUR 29,116
thousand). For this loan, |U Group is obligated to adhere to a covenant. The key financial figure of the
covenant is the net leverage ratio, which is caiculated by dividing the financial debt level by the run rate
EBITDA. As at 12/31/2023, the IU Group had adhered to the covenant. Moreover, the Group has a credit
revolving facility agreement for a maximum amount of EUR 35,000 thousand to cover short-term liquidity
needs. In 2023 the Group made use of this facility three times. At the end of the financia! year there was no
outstanding amount.

As of June 30, 2023, the Group entered into a term loan agreement for an initial principal of CAD 6,794
thousand (EUR 4,704 thousand) at a 10% annual interest rate. Following a set-off agreement dated August
16, 2023, which included a purchase price adjustment for UC Education Inc., the principal was reduced by
CAD 2,921 (EUR 2,022 thousand) to CAD 3,873 thousand (EUR 2,648 thousand). The revised principal and
accrued interest are payable within three years from the date of the original agreement. This loan is integral
to the financing of the acquisition of UC Education Inc.

In 2021 and 2022 related parties granted loans to the Company (amounting EUR 11,088 thousand and
EUR 18,011 thousand, excluding accrued interests). In the framework of the capital increase that took place
in June 2023 these loans were contributed as equity to the Company, resulting in their settlement. Please
refer to notes 24 and 31.

The provisions for employee benefits encompass backlogs of holiday leave not yet taken, severance
payments and bonus entitlements. Other provisions primarily relate to litigation costs of EUR 4,314 thousand
and anticipated VAT back payments due to tax audits of EUR 2,933 thousand.

Litigation costs contain EUR 4,221 thousand for reimbursement claims of students based on the fact
that the German Federal Chamber of Architects currently do not accept the architecture bachelor’s degree
program. Therefore, IU Group has recognized a provision for those matters where management believes
future reimbursements to students are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The approach for best
estimation of the expenditure is based on the probability of reimbursements to students due to their regular
study time since first initial start of the program in 2019.

The management of the Group has comprehensively assessed the potential financial impacts of current
and possible future legal disputes related to the architecture degree programs. Recognizing the inherent risk
and in accordance with the principte of prudence, management has decided to establish appropriate
provisions amounting to EUR 6,455 thousand, hereof EUR 4,221 thousand as provision and EUR 2,234
thousand 4s liability, The amount of the provisions has been carefully determined based on our risk
assessments and using conservative valuation standards to safeguard our company against potential
financial obligations. This approach underscores our commitment to responsible and transparent risk
management and reporting practices. It should be noted, however. that there remains uncertainty regarding
the accuracy of these estimates. While it is possible that the actual amounts could be significantly higher,
this scenario is not currently considered likely

Current provisions will result in corresponding payments in the financial year 2024

No further material uncertainties exist regarding the measurement of provisions.

to enroll more students.

The amount that is not included in the financial instruments primarily contains tax and salary liabilities
as well as the balances of students on prepaid cards.

\f reclassifications into other levels of the measurement hierarchy are necessary, this takes place at the
end of the financial year in which the event necessitating the reclassification takes place. There were no
reclassifications in the financial year under review.

Non-current and other assets retate to lease security deposits and finance lease receivables. The fair
value corresponds approximately to the carrying amount

In the case of current receivables and payables as well as liquid funds, the carrying amounts correspond
approximately to the fair values due to the short remaining term. The current other assets are non-interest-
bearing. Therefore, the carrying amount corresponds to the fair value (see also note 21).

The fair value of the non-current financial liabilities is based on the discounted cash flows using the
current market interest rate for the type of financial liabilities concerned. Due to the use of unobservable
inputs, including own default risk, they are classified into fair value level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

Non-current financial liabilities primarily consist of a joan from an external lender (see note 27). For
these non-current financial liabilities, the fair value does not materially deviate fram the carrying amount. The
fair value is based on the discounted cash flows using the current market interest rate for the type of financial
liability concerned. Due to the use of unobservable inputs, including own default rate risk, they are classified
into fair value level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

Market risks

54

The Group is mostly financed through long-term loans and trade payables. The resulting risks include
market risks, in particular credit risks, interest rate risks and currency risks as well as liquidity risk, which are
continuously monitored.

The procedures for managing the individual types of risks are presented below.
Credit risk

As part of its business activities with third parties, the Group is generally exposed to a global default risk
that primarily results from its operating business. This risk results from the possibility of a contractual party
not fulfilling its obligations.

Credit risks primarily affect cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, lease receivables and lease
security deposits

The Group carries out transactions exclusively with banks with good creditworthiness. Due to this
business model, credit risk concentrations in the area of receivables do usually not exist.

The maximum credit risk in the event of a counterparty defaulting corresponds to the carrying amount
of these instruments.

The carrying amount of the following financial instruments represent the maximum credit risk. As at the
reporting date the maximum risk amounted to:

Carrying amounts of financial instrument in EUR’000 2023 2022
Trade receivables 61,974 37,660
Other assets 12,478 11,174
Cash and cash equivalents 34,015 16,670

For trade receivables, IU Group uses the “simplified approach” and recognizes the expected credit
losses over the entire remaining term upon addition. Within the simplified approach, 1U Group determines
the anticipated credit defaults broken down according to risk group and with historical default rates taken
into consideration. The categorization into the respective risk groups is made based on common credit risk
characteristics. For |U Group, these are receivables from in-person courses, receivables from online courses
and other receivables. Based on historical default data from the prior financial year and with future-oriented
macro-economic indicators taken into consideration, risk clusters and specific default rates are determined.
The Group has identified gross domestic product and the unemployment rate as the most relevant factors
and adjusts the historical loss rates based on the anticipated changes in these factors.

A loss allowance on an individual basis is made within the “simplified approach’ if one or more events
have occurred that negatively affect the creditworthiness of the debtor. Such events include, among other
possibilities, delays in payment, impending insolvency or concessions to the borrower due to payment
difficulties. Trade receivables are written off directly if their recoverability can no longer be reasonably
expected. This is the case, for example, if the debtor becomes insolvent.

The Company takes account of the probability of default at the date of the initial recognition of assets
and the presence of any significant increase in the default risk throughout all reporting periods. In order to
assess whether the default risk has increased significantly, the Company compares the default risk relating
to the asset on the reporting date with the default risk as at the date of initial recognition. In this context,
available, appropriate and reliable future-oriented information is taken into account. In particular, indicators
such as internal and external creditworthiness assessments as well as actual or anticipated significant
changes in financial performance are taken into consideration here.

These are the only financial instruments in the general credit risk approach for financial instruments
(general approach) with impairment. The carrying amount reflects the maximum credit risk.

55

The 2023 development of the loss allowance based on the expected credit loss for trade receivables is
shown in the following statement:

in EUR'000 01/01/2023 Release Utilization Additions 12/34/2023

Trade receivables 10,829 QO 4,543 6.040 12,326

The 2022 development of the !oss allowance based on the expected credit loss for trade receivables
and the related party loan is shown in the following statement:

in EUR'000 01/01/2022 Release Utilization Additions 12/31/2022
Trade receivables 6,535 0 460 4,754 10,829
Related party oan 5,456 5,456 i) ° Q

Cash and cash equivalents relate to bank balances. In addition, the creditworthiness of the banks is
regularly monitored.

Due to the short depositing period and the good creditworthiness of the banks, cash and cash
equivalents have a low default risk. Therefore, no material impairments were identified as at 12/31/2023.

Interest rate risk

The Group is subject to interest rate risks due to a variable interest-bearing loan. Risk controlling
continuously monitors the interest risk using appropriate instruments and methods and reports regularly to
the management on current developments. The objective of the risk strategy is to limit or eliminate the risks
from interest rate changes.

The loan from unrelated third parties is also subject to a variable interest rate oriented towards the 3-
month Euribor rate. Pursuant to the loan agreement, a negative Euribor interest rate does not result in a
reduction of the interest burden.

56

Currency risk

Following its recent expansions into Canada and the UK, the Group now faces enhanced currency risks
due to financial transactions and operations in Canadian Dollars and British Pounds, alongside the primary
currency, the Euro. These additional currencies introduce volatility from exchange rate fluctuations, which
could potentially impact the Group’s financial results. The finance department actively monitors these
currency risks and evaluates their potential impact on an ongoing basis, ensuring that the Group's financial
management practices adapt appropriately to these risks.

Liquidity risk

The Group continuously monitors the risk of potential liquidity shortfalls with consideration for the
prospective due dates of financial liabilities as well as the expected cash flows from operating activities. Any
liquidity risks are counteracted by way of the most long-term financing possible. Continuous monitoring of
the parts of financing that are due in the short-term takes place using corresponding corporate planning.

The contractual cash flows from leasing liabilities are described under note 24. The contractual
cash flows from other liabilities are broken down as follows:

Events after the reporting period

On August 1, 2024, the Steigenberger Akademie, a sub-lessee of our organization and a renowned
hotel management school since 1948, will close due to a decline in new talent entering the hospitality
industry. The financial impact of this closure is currently being assessed. The maximum risk from the
termination of the contract due to the closure of Steigenberger Akademie amounts to EUR 2.613 thousand,
representing the value of the finance lease receivables as of July 31, 2024. Further details and necessary
adjustments will be provided as more information becomes available.

In June 2024, IU Group repriced its EUR 585 million Term Loan B due in December 2028,
simultaneously upsizing it to EUR 600 million. This repricing was net leverage neutral and reduced the
interest rate margin applicable to the loan from EURIBOR + 4.46% to EURIBOR + 3.75%. The transaction
is expected to enhance the cash flow profile by lowering interest payments. The group anticipates transaction
costs of EUR 1.3 million. This strategic move not only reshaped the capital structure but also demonstrated
ongoing cammitment to optimizing financial performance and good credit standing with lenders.

There were no further events with a significant effect on net assets, financial position and results of
operations after December 31, 2023.

2. Research & Development Report

The R&D activities cannot be compared with those of a manufacturing company. The focus is on the
development of new study courses and the further development of the existing portfolio as part of the re-
accreditation and optimization of the user experience with the help of innovative technologies.

Intensive market research is conducted to understand existing markets as well as potential growth
opportunities and thus be able to better address the students’ needs. As part of academic research, the
professors of IU Internationale Hochschule also participate in projects dealing with the further development
of teaching as well as trend studies in the area of education, change in the working world and technological
transformation. Furthermore, teaching materials, such as scripts, interactive exams, videos and examination

documents are prepared.

In the financial year 2023, total research and development costs amounted to EUR 88,785 thousand (prior
year: EUR 65,726 thousand), i.e. in financial year 2023 alone, EUR 23,243 thousand (prior year EUR 27,811
thousand) were capitalized, thereof, EUR 3,625 thousand relate to self-generated software (prior year:
EUR 7,389 thousand). R&D costs also include costs for external R&D service companies. Research and
development expenses for third-party funded projects decreased to EUR 314 thousand (prior year: EUR 767

thousand).

3. Economic Report
3.1. Development of the Sector and the Macroeconomy

The German Council of Economic Experts reported a 0.3% decline in the German Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) in 2023, primarily attributed to the decrease in domestic demand, notably influenced by the significant
drop in government consumption expenditure at the beginning of the year. Looking ahead to the forecast
period until the end of 2024, private consumption expenditure is expected to recover due to the resurgence
of real incomes. However, the unexpectedly slow global economic recovery, particularly in China, is likely to
persist and continue to restrain German exports in 2024, resulting in a projected negative contribution from
trade. Itis projected that GDP growth will marginally improve in 2024, reaching 0.3%. The external economic
environment in Germany is significantly obscured, with factors such as global monetary tightening and the
moderate growth in China contributing to this outlook. While the United States has provided positive external
economic impetus since the spring of 2023, the economic performance in the Eurozone only experienced
marginal growth for the second consecutive quarter in Q2 2023. Furthermore, the Chinese economy has
grown notably slower in 2023 than in the past and below expectations following the conclusion of their Zero-
Covid policy. Looking into 2024, a moderate improvement is expected in the global economic situation, even
though China's growth is anticipated to remain weak in relative terms. Therefore, global GDP increased by
3.1% in 2023 and is projected to remain at 3.1% in 2024, reflecting growth rates that are lower compared to
the averages of the 2010s.

The group is currently experiencing a robust and accelerated growth trajectory. This sustained upward trend
in performance and expansion has been consistently evident in our strategic initiatives and financial
outcomes throughout the financial year 2023. In Germany, the number of overall students slightly decreased
by 51 thousand students to 2,870 thousand students in 2023 compared to 2022. At private universities the

number of students moderately increased by 22 thousand students to 365 thousand students in 2023.
Furthermore, 12.7% (prior year 11.8%) of students in Germany study at a private university.

3.2. Business Performance

3.2.1. Sales and student development

|U Group benefited from growth in the service industry sector in 2023 by offering different forms of learning
(on campus study, dual study, part-time study, distance learning) and increased the number of enrolled
students by almost 19% compared to the previous year.

Sales revenues of EUR 506,778 thousand (prior year: EUR 383,169 thousand) were generated in the
financial year from January to December 2023. Compared to the previous year, sales increased in total by
EUR 123,609 thousand or 32%. The majority of students (>80%) originates from Germany

* Categorization has been adjusted and prior year figures have been reclassified accordingly, because new

internal reporting structure was implemented in 2023.

On Campus: Most of the new students start their course towards the end of the year (main intake in October
for the winter semester 2023/2024). There was a constant year on year growth of new study locations,
increasing from 15 to 48 between FY19 and FY23.

B2C DACH Core: Sales increased by 11% year-on-year while the number of paying students increased by
9% compared to the previous year. The increase reflects the impact of efficient marketing investment and

the positive full year impact of “Click & Study” which supports conversion through accelerated matriculation.

B2C DACH Other: While sales decreased by 12% and the number of paying students decreased by 11%
compared to the previous year, the segment's resilience is underscored by the performance of our Business-
to-Government (B2G) operations, which continue to drive a substantial portion of our activity. Despite the

strong performance in B2G, the overai{ decrease is driven by the phasing out of two discontinued offerings.

Appendix |

B2C Internationat: In 2023, the Group enhanced its B2C international segment through the strategic
acquisitions of UFred and LIBF. These acquisitions contributed materially to a 541% increase in sales and
a 82% growth in the number of paying students, bolstered by the success of “Click & Study” and initial
enrollments at LIBF.

3.2.2. Human resources

In the course of 2023, 4,462 staff members were employed on average (number excluding trainees and dual
students, prior year 3,423). The employee base includes both teaching staff and trainer staff as well as
administrative staff with specific technical knowledge and sound professional experience

In 2023, there were 1,177 employees at the higher education institution, which reflected a decrease of 60
individuats (-5%) in comparison to 2022. This decline was primarily due to a reclassification of departments
in the Group. On the other hand, the reclassification of departments also led to an increase in the number of
teaching personnel (+25%).

The segment comprising employees in administration and other areas witnessed substantial growth, with
3,285 individuals employed in 2023. This marked an increase of 1,099 staff members (50%) from the

previous year.

3.2.3. Other important events in the financial! year

Acquisition of the London Institute of Banking and Finance

On March 31, 2023, the Group acquired the operating business of The London Institute of Banking and
Finance (London, UK) by means of an asset deal for a purchase price of GBP 17,209 thousand (EUR 19,519
thousand). The London Institute of Banking and Finance was founded in 1879 and offers professional
qualifications, undergraduate and postgraduate degrees and qualifications in schools to students and
professionals. The business was acquired to expand the academic offering and increase the international

presence of the Group.
Acquisition of the University of Fredericton

On May 10, 2023, the Group also acquired the University of Fredericton (Fredericton, Canada) by means of
a share deal for a purchase price of CAD 82,079 thousand (EUR 55,916 thousand). The University of
Fredericton was founded in 2005 and is a fully online, degree-granting institution offering certificates,
diptoma, and degree programs. The acquisition was made to establish a stronger presence in the
international market, thereby further reinforcing the group's global reputation as a trusted provider of high-
quality higher education

Change of ownership IU Group

In March 2023 a sales and purchase agreement was signed in order to transfer all the shares held by Oakley
CP Holdings Ltd, by CPG Co-Investment | GmbH & Co KG and by CPG Co-Investment Il GmbH & Co KG

Appendix I

to Oakley Capital Guinness Bidco S.a.r.!. with effective date 16 June 2023. After the closing all the series C
shares have been converted to series A shares.

Oakley Capital Guinness Bidco S.a ri. is held for 100% by Oakley Capital Guinness Midco S.a 1. which in
turn is 100% owned by Oakley Capital Guiness Holdco S.a rl. The three of them have their head offices in
Luxembourg

3.3. Results of Operations of the Group

3.3.1. Revenue Development

Sales revenues of the Group increased in the financial year 2023 by 32 percent to EUR 506,778 thousand
(previous year: 40 percent).

‘In EUR thousand / % 2023 — 2022

Amortization/depreciation -57,072 -43,383
Net financiat income/loss -57,812 -26,442
Consolidated loss before income taxes : -25,564 523

The cost of materials and purchased services, primarily driven by the increased need for additional
lecturers, rose disproportionately compared to sales revenue, as these expenses are only marginally
dependent on the number of enrolled students. Personnel expenses increased by 41% compared fo the
previous year primarily due to the general growth of the Group

Amortization/depreciation in the financial year 2023 exceeded the prior-year level. This mainly results from
capital expenditure made in the previous year as well as from capitalized development costs and self-
generated software. Additionally, the depreciation for right-of-use assets and tablets increased
Significantly.

The net financia! loss increased to EUR 57,812 thousand (prior year: EUR 26,442 thousand). This increase
can be attributed to a decrease in financial income, amounting to EUR 1,334 thousand (prior year:

EUR 9,846 thousand) and to an increase in financial expense to EUR $9,146 thousand (previous year:
EUR 36,288 thousand). The increased financial expense is due to a higher borrowed amount and to higher
interest rates.

Due to the growth efforts and the associated increased costs (especially personnel expenses, consulting
fees and interest expenses), the consolidated net loss increased from EUR 13,257 thousand in the
previous year to EUR 37.160 thousand.

Appendix I

3.3.2. Financial Position
Capital Structure
The Group is mostly financed through a long-term loan and trade payables.

In 2021, the Group tock out a loan amounting to EUR 500,000 thousand which was expanded to
EUR 585,000 thousand in 2023. The loan is repayable on 12/8/2028. Interest has to be paid on a quarterly
basis. The interest rate is EURIBOR + 5%. For this loan, IU Group is obligated to adhere to a covenant. The
key financial figure of the covenant is the net leverage ratio, which is calculated by dividing the financial debt
level by the pro forma EBITDA of the last twelve months. In 2023, all conditions of the covenant have been
met. In addition, depending on the net leverage ratio, there is potential to lower the spread by two step-
downs of 0.25% each

For financing the acquisition of University of Fredericton the Group has entered into a term loan agreement
for a principal of CAD 3,873 thousand (EUR 2,648 thousand). The principal and accrued interest are payable

within three years from the date of the original agreement.

Current and non-current lease liabilities increased to EUR 102,099 thousand (prior year: EUR 81,762
thousand) due to the lease of new locations. As a result of higher sales generated, non-current and current
contractual liabilities also increased to EUR 120,256 thousand (prior year: EUR 85,158 thousand) in total.
The higher provisions in the amount of EUR 22,091 thousand (prior year: EUR 16,963 thousand) primarily
relate to other accruals, such as an increase in provisions for holiday of EUR 1,892 thousand and an increase
in provisions for litigations of EUR 1,044 thousand. Trade payables and other liabilities increased to
EUR 52,709 thousand (prior year: EUR 42,042 thousand), which is mainly due to higher trade payables.

Shareholders’ equity amounts to EUR -366,801 thousand (prior year: EUR -389,973 thousand) as of
December 31, 2023. The evolution primarily results from the capital increase, consisting of 588 thousand
new shares with a nominat value of EUR 1. This resulted in a share capital of EUR 2,181 thousand (prior
year: EUR 1,593 thousand). The associated issue premium increased the capital reserve to EUR 79,389
thousand (prior year: EUR 12,008 thousand. This capital increase is related to the acquisition of the
University of Fredericton.

Liquidity

Cash flow from operating activities increased to EUR 106,799 thousand (prior year: EUR 88,025 thousand)
as a result of the positive business development. Cash outflow from investing activities increased to
EUR - 92,459 thousand (prior year: EUR -53,782 thousand), showing cash outflow for the acquisition of LIBF
by EUR 15,754 thousand and for the acquisition of UFred by EUR 31,020 thousand in 2023. The cash flow
from financing activities increased to EUR 2,940 thousand (prior year: EUR -28,077 thousand), mainly due
to the taking on of new financial liabilities to EUR 67,500 thousand (prior year: EUR 14,775 thousand)

Appendix |

3.3.3. Net Assets

The Group discloses a balance sheet total of EUR 568,313 thousand as of December 31, 2023 (prior year:
EUR 404,663 thousand). In assets, 81% account for long-term assets (EUR 461,682 thousand, prior year:
EUR 342,587 thousand). These largely consist of capitalized goodwill (EUR 141,593 thousand, prior year:
EUR 115,276 thousand) as well as intangible assets (EUR 175,800 thousand, prior year: EUR 106,195
thousand)

Due to the lease of new locations the rights of use of leased assets capitalized increased from EUR 72.702
thousand to EUR 90,451 thousand; lease liabilities increased correspondingly. In addition, the expansion
of our business operations was the reason for higher investments made in operating and office equipment,
which increased to EUR 38,807 thousand (prior year: EUR 33,541 thousana).

In current assets, trade receivables in the amount of EUR 61,974 thousand (prior year. EUR 37,660
thousand), cash and bank balances in the amount of EUR 34,015 thousand (prior year:

EUR 16,670 thousand) and other current receivables and assets in the amount of EUR 10,580 thousand
(prior year’ EUR 7,690 thousand) are the largest individual items. Trade receivables have increased in the
reporting year due to the positive business development, while the increase in other current receivables
and assets is primarily due to increased prepaid expenses. Cash and cash equivalents have increased as
a result from reporting date effects and efficient cash management strategies.

3.3.4. Financial and Non-Financial Performance Indicators

In addition to the key figures of sales revenue, development of student numbers and operating cash flow,
the management of the IU Group uses the financial performance indicator “Adjusted EBITDA" ta manage
the business and control the Group. “Adjusted EBITDA’, which is used for internal control, is defined as
follows:

Consolidated earnings before income taxes

+ Financing expenses

- Financial income

+ Amortization/depreciation

= Reported EBITDA

+ Non-recurring costs

+ Startup losses of new locations

= adjusted EBITDA

Adjusted EBITDA amounts to EUR 159.298 thousand (prior year: EUR 116,100 thousand), is slightly below
the planned level of EUR 160,481 thousand and derives from the EBITDA shown here as follows: non-
recurring costs of EUR 32,045 thousand (prior year: EUR 12,567 thousand) and startup losses for new
locations of EUR 36,233 thousand (prior year: EUR 34,232 thousand). The two-digit increase in adjusted
EBITDA predicted for 2023 was achieved

Appendix I

3.3.5. Overall Statement

The Group discloses consolidated comprehensive income of EUR -44,745 thousand (prior year: EUR -
12,828 thousand) and also has generated positive operating cash flow of EUR 106,799 thousand (prior year:
EUR 88,025 thousand) due to strong growth in sales. Based on expected sustainable positive operating
cash flow and the credit revolving facility agreement available, we anticipate sufficient liquidity of the Group
in the years to come. In sespect of the covenants agreed in the current loan agreement, there is adequate
headroom. Due to the very positive business development, the Group’s or an individual subsidiary’s ability
to continue as a going concern is not jeopardized.

The forecast period comprises 12 months after release of the consolidated financial statements by the
management in August 2024.

Below, all significant risks are listed and qualitatively assessed.

Appendix }

5.1.1. Risk management

Continuous risk assessment and structured sharing of the information is done regularly at IU Group and is a
permanent coordination task within the management. All major risks are regularly recorded, discussed, and

classified in the board meetings with the investor.

5.1.2. Warin Ukraine

Current war in Ukraine represents a low risk for IU Group as only few students are coming from the Ukraine
or Russia. As a mainly digital business supply chain risks linked to the Ukraine war are also limited.

5.1.3. IT, Data Privacy, Cyber Risks

IU Group faces risks regarding the functioning of its IT systems both regarding internal and customer facing
processes. Hacking attacks could lead to a breach of data privacy and an outage of its online platform.

IU counters these risks by using standard cloud software (e.g. Salesforce, Workday), by educating
employees by simulating phishing attacks and by subsequent training courses. An external law firm is
supporting IU’s data protection measures on a monthly basis. Cyber risks are minimized by engaging white
hat hackers to perform penetrations tests of its systems and by developing measures to improve systems

security.

5.1.4. Legal & Tax Risks

IU Group identified its legal risks in a legal due diligence. Legal risks in general can arise from disputes with
students, (former) employees, government bodies and investors. [U regularly takes steps to minimize these
risks. As a result, the aggregate of all its legal risks currently presents a medium level of risk, which is not
considered to be a material threat to the company at this stage

The management of IU Group has comprehensively assessed the potential financial impacts of current and
possible future legal disputes related to the architecture degree programs which are provided of IU
Internationale Hochschule GmbH. Recognizing the inherent risk and in accordance with the principle of
prudence, management has decided to establish appropriate provisions and liabilities amounting to EUR
6,455 thousand. The amount of the provisions and liabilities has been carefully determined based on our
risk assessments and using conservative valuation standards to safeguard our company against potential
financial obligations. This approach underscores our commitment to responsible and transparent risk
management and reporting practices. However, should these disputes progress adversely, there is a
possibility that the actual liabilities may exceed our initial estimates. In such cases, enhancing our reserves
and maintaining vigilant oversight will be crucial to managing these risks effectively and upholding our
standards for meticulous financial oversight and transparency

The IU Group NV also monitors the application of the tax authorities’ interpretation, legisiatian and evolution
of case law (e g.. referral to the CJEU by the German Federai Finance Court in case V R 20/22) in the field
of VAT group taxation, as divergent developments could pose risks for |U Group NV

13
Appendix |

5.1.5. Market and economy

A potential economic downturn could impact |U Group's sales and earnings in the medium to tong term due
to the long-term nature of most study programs. This alfows for the early implementation of cost-saving
countermeasures. In the On Campus segment, prospective students might opt for public providers or
vocational training due to better compensation. In the B2C segments, growth could decelerate due to a large
market share, and the introduction of more online or blended courses by public universities could lead to a
decrease in applicants due to different cost structures. The overall risk of a decline in applicants is considered
medium over the medium to tong term. The recent sharp increase in inflation is factored into our planning,
with single-digit inflation covered by automatic price increases in the On Campus segment and regular price

adjustments for new students in the B2C segments to offset inflationary pressures.

5.1.6. Product and development

Product and development risks at |U Group are mitigated through a multi-component strategy, enabling cost-
effective preliminary testing of new B2C study courses online before potentialty expanding them into the On
Campus and physical B2C segments. Emulating industry-leading practices, we integrate advanced Al
technologies to enhance course effectiveness and student interaction during these pilot phases. The
university's scale supports significant investments in new technologies, maintaining its competitive edge.
With the university's growth, maintaining academic quality and student satisfaction necessitates the
recruitment of sufficient full-time academic staff for new courses. Consequently, product and development

risks are considered low.

5.1.7. Accreditation

The operation of a private university in Germany mandates accreditation by the Science Council. IU
Internationale Hochschule was successfully re-accredited in 2021 for another five years. Future efforts
include expanding research activities with the aim of achieving permanent accreditation. Moreover, the risk
of losing accreditation in the UK and Canada is assessed as low and not material, which solidifies the
operational stability in these regions. Consequently, this going-concern risk remains low. Continuing to invest
in compliance and maintaining active dialogue with accrediting agencies will ensure ongoing accreditation

and adaptability to evolving educational standards

5.1.8. University size

Due to the increased university size, there is a risk of an attack by competitors an the business as well as

negative media coverage. This risk is assessed as medium.

Appendix I

5.1.9. Liquidity

Through the implementation of regular liquidity forecasting, monthly cash flow planning up to the end of the
financial year, and monthly plan-to-actual reconciliations, as well as long-term structuring of external
financing and revolving credit facility agreements for short-term capital requirements, liquidity risks are

identified at an early stage. Consequently, the associated risk can be considered low.

5.1.10. Process

All educational programs are managed by comprehensive quality contra! and mainly accredited by external
agencies. This ensures that errors in the operating core business are promptly detected and remedied or
minimized by taking appropriate measures. All educational programs, the efficiency of which is verified by
the relevant academic bodies, are managed by comprehensive quality control, and mainly accredited by
external agencies. This ensures that optimization needs in the operating core business are promptly
identified and remedied or minimized by taking appropriate measures. Overall, the educational programs are
characterized by consistently high levels of participant satisfaction, which results in a low churn rate
(termination by students) before their graduation. The risk of a stronger customer churn is to be regarded as
medium and would lead to a decline in sales.

Due to the strong growth, there is a risk that it may not be possible to recruit sufficient internal staff and
external lecturers. Should the recruitment efforts not be successful, new programs will start later. The risk is
low as, due to the uncertain economic situation, the situation on the labor market is tight and we should

therefore receive sufficient applications. The risk is regarded as low.

Furthermore, in some cases there could be a risk that external parties (e 9. specific chambers of professions)

will not accept the qualifications of IU students for specific professions. However, this risk is regarded as low.

5.1.11. Competitors

The risk of new competitors is low since high market entry barriers exist (accreditation). The overlap with the
offer of traditiona! universities is expected to remain low as these barely focus on our B2C business and,
except for Baden-Wuerttemberg, on our On Campus business. Should a technology provider acquire an
accredited facility and invest high marketing spending, the market share of [U Internationale Hochschule

could come under pressure: currently such a development is not foreseeable. The risk is regarded as low

5.1.12. Credit

Financial instruments that potentially subject |U Group to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of
cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. For cash tU Group is exposed to credit risk in the event
of default by the financial institutions to the extent the amounts recorded on the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets are more than the German federal insurance limits

Appendix |}

IU Group generally does not require collateral or other security in support of accounts receivable. To reduce
credit risk, management performs ongoing evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and maintains an
allowance based upon expected credit losses of outstanding receivables.

5.1.13. Interest

IU Group is exposed to interest rate risk through the impact of rate changes on interest bearing liabilities. IU
Group’s interest rate risks mainly result from Group financing and from interest rate risk arising from variable-
interest liabilities.

To limit the risk of rising interest rates from interest bearing liabilities, the Group has entered an interest rate

cap in the same amount as the external loan.

5.1.14. Geographical Expansion

The strategic acquisitions of LIBF and UFred are instrumental in IU Group's ongoing geographical
expansion, intended to enrich and diversify our educationai offerings while stabilizing revenue streams in the
face of market volatility. These initiatives leverage our platform's capabilities to deploy international degrees,
with initial integrations showing promising outcomes. While these new segments are smaller compared to
our main operations in Germany, the associated risks are manageable, primarily involving strategic
reallocation of resources which may result in opportunity costs. However, their contribution to broadening
our educational reach and reinforcing revenue stability underscores their value, making these ventures
generally low-risk and likely to provide substantial benefits in enhancing our global educational impact.

Continuous opportunity assessment and structured sharing of the information goes without saying for the
|U Group and is a permanent coordination task within the management. All major opportunities are regularly
recorded and discussed in the board meetings with the investor.

Appendix I

5.2.2. Market and economy

in the face of rising global inflation, education is increasingly recognized as a valuable investment, with
individuals seeking to enhance their qualifications to secure higher salaries. This perception could boost
demand for IU Group’s educational offerings, classifying this as a medium opportunity. Further, our strategic
initiatives to expand into global markets are poised to attract new customer segments, enhancing our growth

Prospects.

5.2.3. Product and development

It is planned to design the study courses also for other European countries, which would have a positive
effect on the number of applicants. Moreover, the development plan of the university aims at even stronger
recruiting more international students in the future. Furthermore, individual courses shall be sold to corporate
customers through upskilling, and to jobseekers via educational vouchers. Furthermore, IU Group is actively
working on additional acquisitions in the top higher education countries ta co-develap new online degree
programs that will be offered through our partners as part of the group's multiband platform strategy. The

Opportunity is assessed as high

5.2.4. Accreditation

By acquiring or purchasing a teaching license in other geographies, students in the B2C segment could be
Offered the possibility to obtain dual degrees, which would thus become more attractive for a larger target

Group. The opportunity is assessed as medium

5.2.5. Geographicat expansion

In addition to developing countries already approached to some extent, non-German speaking industrial
Countries could also become interesting markets for IU Internationale Hochschule primarily in the B2C
business. Following our recent strategic acquisitions aimed at strengthening our international presence, we
are implementing new programs across these markets. These initiatives are still scaling up, and while they
Currently represent a smaller proportion of our operations compared to our established markets. they are
expected to contribute significantly to our growth trajectory. The potential for |U Group to capitalize on these

developments is rated as high.

Appendix |

6. Forecast report

The forecast period covers 12 months after the balance sheet date, December 31, 2023. For 2024, IU Group
assumes a stable overall business environment. For B2C and On Campus segments a strong increase in

intake and student numbers is expected.

In 2024, IU Group anticipates for the relevant KPls (sales revenues and number of students) a low double-
digit growth compared to previous year. For the operating cash flow, we expect a mid-double digit growth
Compared to previous year. Further, the adjusted EBITDA will show a slightly higher low double- digit growth

due to economies of scale and efficiency improvements.

Overall, the 1st half of 2024 shows a very positive business development; management assumes that the

expected results will be achieved.
