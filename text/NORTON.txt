2 Accounting policies

Turnover
Turnover is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, Turnover is reduced for
estimated customer returns, rebates and other similar allowances.

Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when all the following conditions are satisfied:

* the Company has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the
goods;

© the Company retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated
with ownership nor effective control over the goods sold;

* the amount of revenue can be measured reliably;

¢ it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Company;
and

« the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.

Specifically, revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when goods are delivered and legal title is
passed.

Tangible fixed assets and depreciation

Tangible fixed assets held for the company's own use are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and
accumulated impairment losses.

At each balance sheet date, the company reviews the carrying amount of its tangible fixed assets to
determine whether there is any indication that any items have suffered an impairment loss. If any such
indication exists, the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the
impairment loss.

Depreciation is provided at the following annual rates in order to write off the cost or valuation less the
estimated residual value of each asset over its estimated useful life:

Plant and machinery 20% Reducing balance

Taxation

The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. The tax currently
payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the profit
and loss account because of items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and
items that are never taxable or deductible. The Company's liability for current tax is calculated using tax
rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.

Stocks

Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell. Costs,
which comprise direct production costs, are based on the method most appropriate to the type of
inventory class, but usually on a first-in-first-out basis. Overheads are charged to profit or loss as incurred.
Net realisable value is based on the estimated selling price less any estimated completion or selling costs.

When stocks are sold, the carrying amount of those stocks is recognised as an expense in the period in
which the related revenue is recognised. The amount of any write-down of stocks to net realisable value
and all losses of stocks are recognised as an expense in the period in which the write-down or loss occurs.
The amount of any reversal of any write-down of stocks is recognised as a reduction in the amount of
inventories recognised as an expense in the period in which the reversal occurs.

Work in progress is reflected in the accounts on a contract by contract basis by recording revenue and
related costs as contract activity progresses.

Trade and other debtors

Trade and other debtors are initially recognised at fair value and thereafter stated at amortised cost using
the effective interest method, less impairment losses for bad and doubtful debts.

Trade and other creditors

Short term creditors are measured at the transaction price. Other financial liabilities, including bank loans,
are measured initially at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are measured subsequently at amortised
cost using the effective interest method.

Defined contribution pensions

The Company operates a defined contribution plan for its employees. A defined contribution plan is a
pension plan under which the company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. Once the
contributions have been paid the company has no further payments obligations.

The contributions are recognised as expenses when they fall due. Amounts not paid are shown in accruals

in the balance sheet. The assets of the plan are held separately from the company in independently
administered funds.

Provisions

Provisions are made where an event has taken place that gives the Company a legal or constructive
obligation that probably requires settlement by a transfer of economic benefit, and a reliable estimate can
be made of the amount of the obligation.

Provisions are charged as an expense to the profit and loss account in the year that the Company becomes
aware of the obligation, and are measured at the best estimate at balance sheet date of the expenditure

required to settle the obligation, taking into account relevant risks and uncertainties.

When payments are eventually made, they are charged to the provision carried in the balance sheet.
