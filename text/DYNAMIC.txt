2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of preparing the financial statements

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102 "The Financial Reporting Standard
applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland" including the provisions of Section 1A "Small Entities" and the Companies Act 2006.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.

Going concern
The company has a net asset position and a healthy bank position and the directors are satisfied that there are sufficient resources in
place to continue operating throughout the going concern assessment period to September 2025. Thus the directors continuc to adopt the
going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.

Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty

In preparing the financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions which affect reported income,
expenses, assets and liabilities. Use of available information and application of judgement are inherent in the formation of estimates,
together with past experience and expectations of future events are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results in
the future could differ from such estimates.

The management do not consider that there are significant judgements, estimates and assumptions that may cause amounts recognised
or disclosed to change in the following reporting periods.

Turnover
Turnover is shown exclusive of Value Added Tax. Turnover from the supply of services represents the value of the services provided to
the extent that there is right to consideration and is recorded at the value of consideration due.

Turnover principally comprises the amount derived from grant funding. The majority of the company's revenue during the period has
been earned under contracts with the Education and Funding and Skills Agency (ESFA), mainly levy funded contracts.

The company contracts with learners in the workplace to assist them in gaining accredited qualifications in their chosen programme of
learning. Under the workplace methodology, funding is received to support learners separately for ‘on programme’ learning and
successfully achieving the qualification. ‘On programme’ funding is recognised over the duration of the learning programme. The
achievement payment is recognised when the learner achieves the qualification

Tangible fixed assets
Depreciation is provided at the following annual rates in order to write off each asset over its estimated useful life.
Fixtures and fittings - 20% on cost
Office equipment - 33% on cost

The assets' residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted prospectively if appropriate, or if there is
an indication of significant change since the last reporting date.

Taxation
Taxation for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Income Statement, except to the extent that it relates
to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.

Current or deferred taxation assets and liabilities are not discounted.

Current tax is recognised at the amount of tax payable using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by
the statement of financial position date.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued
Deferred tax

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the statement of financial position
date.

Timing differences arise from the inclusion of income and expenses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are
recognised in financial statements. Deferred tax is measured using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by

the year end and that are expected to apply to the reversal of the timing difference.

Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered
against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.

Pension costs and other post-retirement benefits
Payments to defined contribution pension schemes are charged as an expense in the period to which they relate.

Operating leases
Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to the Income Statement on a straight line basis over the lease term.

Benefits reecived and reccivable as an incentive to sign an operating Icase are recognised on a straight linc basis over the lease term,
unless another systematic basis in representative of the time pattern of the Icssec's benefit from the use of the Icased assct.

Fixed asset investments
Fixed assct investments are initially recorded at cost, and subscquently stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.

EMPLOYEES AND DIRECTORS
The average number of employees during the year was 48 (2022 - 46).
