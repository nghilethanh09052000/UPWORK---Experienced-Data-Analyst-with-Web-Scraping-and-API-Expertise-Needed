General information

E-Training Limited is a private company limited by shares incorporated in England and Wales.

The registered office and principal place of business is 12 Lambarde Square, 1st Floor, The Greenwich
Centre, Greenwich, London, SE10 9GB.

Accounting policies

2.1

Basis of preparation of financial statements

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention unless otherwise
specified within these accounting policies and in accordance with Section 1A of Financial Reporting
Standard 102, the Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and the Republic of Ireland and
the Companies Act 2006.

The following principal accounting policies have been applied:
Going concern

The directors have prepared forecasts taking into account their assessment of the performance of
the business and are confident that the Company will be able to continue to meet their liabilities as
they fall due for a period of not less than 12 months from the date these accounts are signed. The
directors consider it appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis as a
result.

Foreign currency translation

Functional and presentation currency

The Company's functional and presentational currency is GBP.
Transactions and balances

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the spot exchange
tates at the dates of the transactions.

At each period end foreign currency monetary items are translated using the closing rate. Non-
monetary items measured at historical cost are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the
transaction and non-monetary items measured at fair value are measured using the exchange rate
when fair value was determined.

Revenue

Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the
Company and the revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is measured as the fair value of the
consideration received or receivable, excluding discounts, rebates, value added tax and other sales
taxes. The following criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised:

Revenue from contracts for the provision of professional services is recognised by reference to the
stage of completion when the stage of completion. costs incurred and costs to complete can be
estimated reliably. The stage of completion is calculated by comparing costs incurred, mainly in
relation to contractual hourly staff rates and materials, as a proportion of total costs. Where the
outcome cannot be estimated reliably, revenue is recognised only to the extent of the expenses
recognised that it is probable will be recovered.

2.6

Interest income
Interest income is recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method.
Finance costs

Finance costs are charged to profit or loss over the term of the debt using the effective interest
method so that the amount charged is at a constant rate on the carrying amount.

Pensions
Defined contribution pension plan

The Company operates a defined contribution plan for its employees. A defined contribution plan is a
pension plan under which the Company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. Once the
contributions have been paid the Company has no further payment obligations.

The contributions are recognised as an expense in profit or loss when they fall due. Amounts not paid
are shown in accruals as a liability in the Statement of Financial Position. The assets of the plan are
held separately from the Company in independently administered funds.

Current and deferred taxation

The tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in profit or loss
except that a charge attributable to an item of income and expense recognised as other
comprehensive income or to an item recognised directly in equity is also recognised in other
comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.

The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of tax rates and laws that have been
enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date in the countries where the Company operates
and generates income.

Deferred tax balances are recognised in respect of ail timing differences that have originated but not
reversed by the reporting date, except that:

. The recognition of deferred tax assets is limited to the extent that it is probable that they will be
recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits; and

. Any deferred tax balances are reversed if and when all conditions for retaining associated tax
allowances have been met.

Deferred tax balances are not recognised in respect of permanent differences except in respect of
business combinations, when deferred tax is recognised on the differences between the fair values of
assets acquired and the future tax deductions available for them and the differences between the fair
values of liabilities acquired and the amount that will be assessed for tax. Deferred tax is determined
using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.

Accounting policies (continued)

2.9 Tangible fixed assets

Tangible fixed assets under the cost model are stated at historical cost less accumulated
depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Historical cost includes expenditure that is
directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of
operating in the manner intended by management.

Depreciation is charged so as to allocate the cost of assets less their residual value over their
estimated useful lives, on a reducing balance basis.

Depreciation is provided on the following basis:

Plant and machinery - 25% reducing balance
The assets’ residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted
prospectively if appropriate, or if there is an indication of a significant change since the last reporting

date.

Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount
and are recognised in profit or toss.

2.10 Debtors

Short-term debtors are measured at transaction price, less any impairment.

2.11 Creditors

Short-term creditors are measured at the transaction price. Other financial liabilities, are measured
initially at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are measured subsequently at amortised cost using
the effective interest method.

2.12 Provisions for liabilities

Provisions are recognised when an event has taken place that gives rise to a legal or constructive
obligation, a transfer of economic benefits is probable and a reliable estimate can be made.

Provisions are measured as the best estimate of the amount required to settle the obligation, taking
into account the related risks and uncertainties.

Increases in provisions are generally charged as an expense to profit or loss.

Accounting policies (continued)

2.13 Financial instruments

The Company has elected to apply the provisions of Section 11 “Basic Financial Instruments” of FRS
102 to all of its financial instruments.

Basic financial assets

Basic financial assets, which include trade and other receivables, cash and bank balances, are
initially measured at their transaction price including transaction costs and are subsequently carried
at their amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any provision for impairment, unless
the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where the transaction is measured at the
present value of the future receipts discounted at a market rate of interest.

Discounting is omitted where the effect of discounting is immaterial. The Company's cash and cash
equivalents, trade and most other receivables due with the operating cycle fall into this category of
financial instruments.

Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each reporting date.

Financial assets are impaired when events, subsequent to their initial recognition, indicate the
estimated future cash flows derived from the financial asset(s) have been adversely impacted. The
impairment loss will be the difference between the current carrying amount and the present value of
the future cash flows at the asset(s) original effective interest rate.

If there is a favourable change in relation to the events surrounding the impairment loss then the
impairment can be reviewed for possible reversal. The reversal will not cause the current carrying
amount to exceed the original carrying amount had the impairment not been recognised. The
impairment reversal is recognised in the profit or loss.

Financial liabilities

Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual
arrangements entered into. An equity instruments any contract that evidences a residual interest in
the assets of the Company after the deduction of all its liabilities.

Basic financial liabilities, which include trade and other payables. bank loans and other loans are
initially measured at their transaction price after transaction costs. When this constitutes a financing
transaction, whereby the debt instrument is measured at the present value of the future receipts
discounted at a market rate of interest. Discounting is omitted where the effect of discounting is
immaterial.

Debt instruments are subsequently carried at their amortised cost using the effective interest rate
method.

Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods and services that have been acquired in the ordinary
course of business from suppliers. Trade payables are classified as current liabilities if the payment is
due within one year. If not, they represent non-current liabilities. Trade payables are initially
recognised at their transaction price and subsequently are measured at amortised cost using the
effective interest method. Discounting is omitted where the effect of discounting is immaterial.
