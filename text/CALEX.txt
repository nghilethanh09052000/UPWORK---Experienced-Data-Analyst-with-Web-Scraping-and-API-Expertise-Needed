Directors’ Report For The Year Ended 30 September 2023

The directors present their report and the financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2023.

Principal Activity

The company’s principal activity continues to be that of a multi-sector learning & development company that specialises in the
design and delivery of innovative training programmes that deliver maximum performance impact.

Directors

The directors who held office during the year were as follows:
Mrs Wendy Miell-Ingram
Mr David Miell-Ingram

Statement of Directors' Responsibilities

The directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic Report, the Directors’ Report and the financial statements in accordance
with applicable law and regulations.

Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors have
elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United
Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS102 'The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of
Ireland’, and applicable law), Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of the profit or loss of the company for that
period. In preparing the financial statements the directors are required to:

* select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;

* make judgments and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;

* state whether applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS102, have been followed subject to any
material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements;

* prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will
continue in business.

The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the company's
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and enable them to ensure
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the
company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the
company's website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Statement of Disclosure of Information to Auditors
In the case of each director in office at the date the Directors' Report is approved:

® so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the company’s auditors are unaware; and

* they have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as directors in order to make themselves aware of any
relevant audit information and to establish that the company's auditors are aware of that information.

On behalf of the board

Independent Auditor's Report
to the Members of
Calex UK Ltd

Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of Calex UK Ltd for the year ended 30 September 2023 which comprise the Profit and
Loss Account, Statement of Comprehensive Income, Balance Sheet, Statement of Changes of Equity, Statement of Cash Flows
and the related notes, including a summary of significant accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that has been
applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice), including FRS 102 "The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland”.

In our opinion the financial statements:

* give a true and fair view of the state of the company's affairs as at 30 September 2023 and of its profit/(loss) for the year
then ended;

® have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and

® have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial
statements section of our report. We are independent of the company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are
relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other
ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Conclusions Relating to Going Concern

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the
preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that,
individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the entity's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least
12 months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of
this report.

Other Information

The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and our
auditor's report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not
cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of
assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or
our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies
or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial
statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that
there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this
regard.

Opinions on Other Matters Prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
* the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial

statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
* the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

Independent Auditor's Report (continued)
to the Members of
Calex UK Ltd

Matters on Which We Are Required to Report by Exception

In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we
have not identified material misstatements in the directors' report.

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in
our opinion:

* adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches
not visited by us;

the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records or returns;

certain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made;

we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or

the directors were not entitled to prepare the financial statements in accordance with the small companies regime and
take advantage of the small companies’ exemptions in preparing the directors' report and from the requirement to
prepare a strategic report.

Responsibilities of Directors

As explained more fully in the Directors' Responsibilities Statement set out on page 2, the directors are responsible for the
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as
the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement,
whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the company's ability to continue as a going
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the
directors either intend to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is
a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or
in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these
financial statements.

The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below:

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our
responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which
our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below:

As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial
statements, including how fraud may occur by enquiring of management of its own consideration of fraud. We did not identify
any key audit matters relating to irregularities, including fraud.

As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial
statements, including how fraud may occur by enquiring of management of its own consideration of fraud. We did not identify
any key audit matters relating to irregularities, including fraud.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council's
website www. frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor's report.

Use Of Our Report

This report is made solely to the company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company's members those matters that we are
required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company's members as a body, for our audit work,
for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Notes to the Financial Statements
For The Year Ended 30 September 2023

1. General Information

Calex UK Ltd is a private company, limited by shares, incorporated in England & Wales, registered number 05941906 . The
registered office is 21 The Quadrant, Barton Lane, Abingdon, Oxfordshire, OX14 3YS.

2. Accounting Policies
2.1. Basis of Preparation of Financial Statements

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with Financial
Reporting Standard 102 "The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland" and the
Companies Act 2006.

2.2. Turnover

Turnover is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of discounts and value added taxes.
Turnover includes revenue earned from the sale of goods and from the rendering of services. Turnover is reduced for
estimated customer returns, rebates and other similar allowances.

Sale of goods

Turnover from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods has
transferred to the buyer. This is usually at the point that the customer has signed for the delivery of the goods.

Rendering of services

Turnover from the rendering of services is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract. The stage of
completion of a contract is measured by comparing the costs incurred for work performed to date to the total estimated
contract costs, Turnover is only recognised to the extent of recoverable expenses when the outcome of a contract cannot
be estimated reliably.

2.3. Intangible Fixed Assets and Amortisation - Goodwill

Goodwill is the difference between amounts paid on the acquisition of a business and the fair value of the separable net
assets. It has been fully amortised in an ealier accounting period.

2.4. Tangible Fixed Assets and Depreciation

Tangible fixed assets are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost of the fixed assets, less their estimated residual value,
over their expected useful lives on the following bases:

Motor Vehicles 25% straight line
Fixtures & Fittings 20% straight line

2.5. Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents are basic financial assets and include cash in hand and deposits held at call with banks, other
short-term highly liquid investments that mature in no more than three months from the date of acquisition and are
readily convertible to a known amount of cash with insignificant risk of change in value, and bank overdrafts.

2.6. Taxation
Corporation Tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.

The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the
statement of comprehensive income because of items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other year
and items that are never taxable or deductible. The company’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.

Deferred tax is recognised on timing differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are
generally recognised for all taxable timing differences. Deferred tax assets are generally recognised for all deductible
temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible
timing differences can be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting
period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or
part of the asset to be recovered.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the
liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted
by the end of the reporting period. Deferred tax liabilities are presented within provisions for liabilities and deferred tax
assets within debtors. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and asset reflects the tax consequences that would
follow from the manner in which the Company expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying
amount of its assets and liabilities.

Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)
For The Year Ended 30 September 2023

2.6. Taxation - continued

Current or deferred tax for the year is recognised in profit or loss, except when they related to items that are recognised
in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax is also recognised in
other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.
