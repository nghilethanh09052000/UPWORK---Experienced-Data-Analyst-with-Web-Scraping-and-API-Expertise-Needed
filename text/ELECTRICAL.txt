Statement of Directors' Responsibilities

The directors are responsible for preparing the Directors' Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law
and regulations.

Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors have
elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United
Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements
unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of the profit or loss of the
company for that period. In preparing the financial statements the directors are required to:

* select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;

* make judgments and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;

® prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will
continue in business.

The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the company's
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and enable them to ensure
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the
company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the

company's website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Small Company Rules

This report has been prepared in accordance with the special provisions relating to companies subject to the small companies
regime within Part 15 of the Companies Act 2006.

On behalf of the board

Mr M A Harding

Director

Electrical Academy Ltd
Notes to the Financial Statements
For The Year Ended 31 July 2024

1. General Information

Electrical Academy Ltd is a private company, limited by shares, incorporated in England & Wales, registered number 10856857 .
The registered office is Unit 1 Union Park, Bircholt Road, Maidstone, ME15 9XT.

2. Accounting Policies
2.1. Basis of Preparation of Financial Statements

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with Financial
Reporting Standard 102 section 1A Small Entities "The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of
Ireland" and the Companies Act 2006.

2.2. Turnover

Turnover is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of discounts and value added taxes.
Turnover includes revenue earned from the sale of goods and from the rendering of services. Turnover is reduced for
estimated customer returns, rebates and other similar allowances.

2.3. Tangible Fixed Assets and Depreciation
Tangible fixed assets are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.

Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost of the fixed assets, less their estimated residual value,
over their expected useful lives on the following bases:

Leasehold Improvements 16.6% straight line
Plant & Machinery 25% straight line
Motor Vehicles 20% straight line
Fixtures & Fittings 20% straight line
Computer Equipment 33% straight line

2.4. Leasing and Hire Purchase Contracts

Assets obtained under finance leases are capitalised as tangible fixed assets. Assets acquired under finance leases are
depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives. Assets acquired under hire purchase contracts are
depreciated over their useful lives. Finance leases are those where substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership
are assumed by the company. Obligations under such agreements are included in the creditors net of the finance charge
allocated to future periods. The finance element of the rental payment is charged to the income statement so as to
produce a constant periodic rate of charge on the net obligation outstanding in each period.

Rentals applicable to operating leases where substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership remain with the lessor
are charged to income statement as incurred.

2.5. Taxation
Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.

The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the
statement of comprehensive income because of items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years
and items that are never taxable or deductible. The company's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.

Deferred tax is recognised on timing differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are
generally recognised for all taxable timing differences. Deferred tax assets are generally recognised for all deductible
temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible
timing differences can be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting
period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or
part of the asset to be recovered.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the
liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted
by the end of the reporting period. Deferred tax liabilities are presented within provisions for liabilities and deferred tax
assets within debtors. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflect the tax consequences that would
follow from the manner in which the Company expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying
amount of its assets and liabilities.

Current or deferred tax for the year is recognised in profit or loss, except when they related to items that are recognised

in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax is also recognised in
other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.
