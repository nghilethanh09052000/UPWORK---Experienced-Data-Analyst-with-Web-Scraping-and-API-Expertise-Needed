Strategic Report
For the Year Ended 31 January 2024

The directors present their Strategic Report together with the audited financial statements for the year ended 31
January 2024.

Principal activity and review of the business

The principal activities of the Company during the year was the delivery of government funded training
programmes for 16 to 18 year old students and adult learners, provision of learning content and recruitment
services. .

Learning Curve Group Limited provides high quality education and training to learners throughout the country
with revenues funded via study programmes, adult education budget, national skills fund, apprenticeships, and
advanced learner loans.

All our programmes are designed to complement existing in-house training provisions, whilst improving the
learners' knowledge and skills by assessing their core competencies against national standards.

‘With a team drawn from both education and industry backgrounds we have the right mix of academic and
practical experience to provide the best tailored training solution possible. We are based in the North East of
England but have a national network of trainers, tutors and talent coaches so we are ideally placed to provide a
consistent, reliable and organised service. .

Our accredited programmes are designed to complement employers’ existing in-house training provision and
improve each learner's knowledge and skills by assessing their core competencies against national standards.

We are directly funded by the Education Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) and Education Funding Agency and are
also the largest sub-contractor partner to further education (FE) colleges of our type. Coupled with our extensive
portfolio of services that support FE providers to reach their targets, this allows us to help in excess of 100,000
learners each year to achieve a nationally recognised qualification.

We are one of the largest publisher of specialist FE materials at levels two and three, and a creator of
groundbreaking online and paper distance learning resources that support people to learn new skills to advance
their careers.

We believe our mission statement “transforming lives through learning” underpins everything we do. This core
value is deeply rooted in our organisation culture, strategic aims and objectives, and through it we will continue to
pursue our ambition of supporting people to gain life enhancing qualifications, and employers and FE providers
to improve their businesses and services.

Strategic Report (continued)
For the Year Ended 31 January 2024
Principal activity and review of the business (continued)
Agilitas Private Equity is the ultimate controlling party of the Company.

At the year end the Company closed with a strong Statement of Financial Position and a closing cash balance of
£2,235,948 (2023 - £3,784,389).

Key performance indicators (KPIs)

The directors use a number of KPIs to assess the performance of the business.

Turnover for the year was £32,817,203 a decrease of 5.7% on the prior year (2023 - £34,814,552).
Gross profit has increased by 2.7% to £17,656,348 (2023 - £17,190,185).

Gross profit margin for the year has increased to 54% (2023 - 49%) in the year compared to the prior year driven
by the impact of higher levels of subcontracting and face to face delivery.

As reported as a subsequent balance sheet event in last years’ financial statements the above results show the
impact on the business of not being awarded any direct AEB contract in July 2023. The business has mitigated
against the loss of revenue relating to this contact, however this is at a lower margin. The company has an
ongoing legal case against DFE in relation to this lost contract. No amounts in respect of this claim have been
accrued in these financial statements.

Administrative expenses have increased by 24.2% to £16,088,607 (2023 - £12,957,138), reflecting the
investment in the infrastructure to support the business in the current year as well as expected future growth.

The key performance measure considered by the board is adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA has decreased
by 12.9% to £7,389,251 (2023 - £8,483,954).

2024 2023

Exceptional costs in the year relate to one-off non-recurring items that were not related to the ongoing operations
of the business. A significant portion of the exceptional costs related to staff restructuring, academy closures and
professional fees. The exceptional cost treatment is in line with agreements that the Company has in place with
its funding providers.

Strategic Report (continued)
For the Year Ended 31 January 2024

Section 172 Statement

The directors of the Company consider, both individually and collectively, that they have acted in the way that
would most likely promote the success of the Company for the benefit of its members as a whole (having regard
to relevant stakeholders and matters set out in section 172(1)(a-f) of the Companies Act 2006) in the decisions
taken during the year ended 31 January 2023, and in doing so have regard, among matters to:

The likely consequences of any decision in the long term

When making decisions the Board also considers the impact of the decision on the Company the impact of its
decision on the Company's stakeholders, the tong-term consequences of its decision on the Company and on
the, the desirability of maintaining the reputation and high standards of the Company and the need to act fairly
between the difference stakeholders of the Company.

The interest of the Company's employees

The directors are committed to ensuring employees are provided with information on matters of concern to them
as employees, including the financial and economic factors affecting the performance of the Company.

During the year the Company made use of its newsletters to allow for timely and enhanced communications to
its employees. The Company also holds an annual staff conference to sustain the values and cultures of the
business.

The need to foster the Company's business relationships with suppliers, customers and others

The Company is committed to fostering good business relationships with suppliers, customers and other
stakeholders. The business is operated in an ethical and responsible way with high standards of business
conduct. There are processes and policies in place to ensure that all customers are treated fairly, and with due
care. In relation to suppliers, the Company's procurement and outsourcing policy ensures that tender processes
are fair and transparent, and suppliers receive sufficient feedback.

The need to foster the Company's operations on the community and environment

The Company recognises the need to foster operations within the community, and regularly engages with
community centres all over the country to deliver government funded education and training to learners who
have the need to increase their knowledge and skills. The Company recognises the need to consider the
environment and have energy efficient lighting in all locations and encourage staff to participate in virtual
meetings in order to reduce the Company's carbon footprint. .

The desirability of the Company maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct

When making decisions, the directors consider the insights obtained through relevant stakeholder engagement
activities as well as the need to maintain a reputation for high standards of business conduct. The directors
ensure the Company has adequate systems and resources to meet the everyday demands of the business, and
have invested in both finance and MIS systems in recent years.

The need to act fairly as between members of the Company

strategy through the long-term, taking into consideration the impact on stakeholders. In doing so, our directors
act fairly between the Company's members and are required to balance the Company's interest with those of
other stakeholders, and this can sometimes mean that certain stakeholder interests may not be fully aligned.

Learning Curve Group Limited

Strategic Report (continued)
For the Year Ended 31 January 2024

Principal risks and uncertainties

The majority of the revenue generated by the Company is ultimately funded by the government via the ESFA.
ESFA funding is split between adult education budget, advanced learner loans, apprenticeships, and study
programmes. The Company accesses this funding via direct contracts with the ESFA, sub-contracts with FE
colleges and direct contracts with levy paying employers.

The Company manages revenue risk by ensuring they have well diversified sources of revenue due to the
number of subcontract partners they engage with as well as continued investment in their internal quality audit
team who monitor the consistency and correctness of funding paperwork throughout the Company.

Changes to the UK government and/or the policy initiatives they pursue is the primary risk facing the Company.
Ultimately funding in this sector is dependent on Government priorities and is allocated annually (except for the
apprenticeship levy). Following the completion of Brexit on 31 January 2020, social mobility issues and skills
shortages it is imperative that the government continue to invest in further education.

Financial risk management objectives and policies

The principal financial instruments used by the Company are cash, trade creditors, trade debtors and loans to
and from other companies in the Group. The management of these instruments provides finance for the
Company's operations.

The main risks arising from the Company's financial instruments are interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity
risk. The directors review and agree policies for managing each of these risks, which are outlined below.

Credit risk

The Company's principal financial assets are cash and debtors. All cash deposits at the reporting date were held
in the UK. Reputable financial institutions are used in the placement of cash deposits, to reduce the overall credit
risk to the Company. In addition, the Company reviews the debtor position regularly. Given the nature of the
Company's customers and their credit worthiness the Company considers the risk of significant bad debts to be
low.

Liquidity risk

The Company seeks to manage financial risk by ensuring sufficient liquidity is available to meet fore-seeable
needs and to invest cash assets safely and profitably. The Company has no external borrowings.

Interest rate risk
Cash reserves are held within a high interest current account to achieve the best interest returns within the

constraints allowed by its liquidity and credit risk policies.

This report was approved by the boardon 31 October 2024 and signed on its behalf.

Matters covered in the Strategic Report

accordance with S414C(11) as the directors consider them to be of strategic importance to the Company.

Future developments

There are no significant future developments which the directors believe require disclosure in addition to those
disclose under events after the reporting period.

Learning Curve Group Limited

Directors’ Report (continued)
For the Year Ended 31 January 2024

Going concern

The directors have reviewed detailed projections that have been produced to identify any potential impact of high
inflation, high interest rates and the cost of living crisis on the future financial performance of the business up to
and including January 2026.

The financial information reviewed by the Board includes a detailed profit and loss as well as cash flow
information together with the level of liquid resources available to the Group. The projections have also been
shared with lenders under the terms of the Group banking arrangement.

Further to the loss of AEB contracts after the last reporting date and tightening in the sub-contracting regulations
together with a continued high-interest rate environment the Group has had to renegotiate with their lenders. This
tesulted in covenant waivers being obtained for April 2024, July 2024 and October 2024, with a reset from
January 2025. The new covenants provide the Group with sufficient tevels of headroom and trading results
continue to improve. Agilitas, the Company's Ultimate Parent Company, have also injected new equity into the
business with £3.5m received in October 2024.

As part of this process a detailed forecast has been stress tested on the basis of a further reduction in revenue
with potential cost reduction mitigations also taken into account. The forecasts have been reviewed against the
new covenant requirements in place for the next 12 months and the business has sufficient levels of headroom
against its bank covenants. The cash position of the business is also expected to be sufficient over the forecast
period.

The going concern assessment has been made at group level and the directors have confirmed that the group
will provide financial support to the entity as required. Following this assessment the directors are confident that
the Company will continue for the foreseeable future and it is therefore considered appropriate to prepare the
financial statements on the going concern basis.

Employment of disabled persons

The Company is committed to a policy of recruitment and promotion on the basis of aptitude and ability without
discrimination of any kind. Particular attention is given to the training and promotion of disabled employees to
ensure that their career, development is not unfairly restricted by their disability, or perceptions of it.

The Company's HR procedures make clear that full and fair consideration must be given to applications made by
and the promotion of disabled persons. Where an employee becomes disabled whilst employed by the
Company, the HR procedures also require that reasonable effort is made to ensure they have the opportunity for
continued employment within the Company. Retraining of employees who become disabled whilst employed by
the Company is offered where appropriate.

Engagement with employees

The directors are committed to ensuring employees are-provided with information on matters of concern to them
as employees, including the financial and economic factors affecting the performance of the Company: During
the year the Group made use of its newsletters to allow for timely and enhanced communications. The Company
also used its employee forums where staff representatives from across the business met with senior
management to discuss changes and provide feedback.

Learning Curve Group Limited

Directors’ Report (continued)
For the Year Ended 31 January 2024

Engagement with others

The directors have had regard to the need to foster the Company's business retationships with suppliers,
customers and others, and the effect of that regard, including on the principal decisions taken by the Company
during the financial year.

Qualifying third party indemnity provisions

As permitted by the Articles of Association, the directors have the benefit of an indemnity which is a qualifying
third party indemnity provision as defined by Section 234 of the Companies Act 2006. The indemnity was in force
throughout the last financial year and is currently in force. The Company also purchased and maintained
throughout the financial year Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance in respect of itself and its directors.

Each of the persons who are directors at the time when this Directors’ Report is approved has confirmed that:

° so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company's auditor is
unaware; and

° the director has taken all the steps that ought to have been taken as a director in order to be aware of any
relevant audit information and to establish that the Company's auditor is aware of that information.

Events after the reporting period

high-interest rate environment the Group has had to renegotiate with their lenders. This resulted in covenant
waivers being obtained for April 2024, July 2024 and October 2024, with a reset from January 2025. The new
covenants provide the Group with sufficient levels of headroom and trading results continue to improve. As part
of this process Agilitas, the Company's Ultimate Parent Company, have also injected new equity into the

Director

Learning Curve Group Limited

Directors' Responsibilities Statement
For the Year Ended 31 January 2024

The directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic Report, the Directors' Report and the financial
statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.

Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law, the
directors have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company law,
the directors must.not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair
view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period.

In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:

. select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;

. make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;

. state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures
disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and

° prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the

Company will continue in business.

The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain
the Company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the
Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They
are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

Learning Curve Group Limited

Independent Auditor's report to the members of Learning Curve Group Limited

Opinion on the financial statements
In our opinion the financial statements:

. give a true and fair view of the state of the Company's affairs as at 31 January 2024 and of its profit for the
year then ended;

. have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice; and

° have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable
law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit
of the financial statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Independence

We are independent of the Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of
the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

Conclusions relating to going concern

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of
accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or
conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a
going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the Directors with respect to going concern are described in the
relevant sections of this report.

Learning Curve Group Limited

Independent Auditor's report to the members of Learning Curve Group Limited (continued)

Other information

The Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information
included in the Annual report and financial statements, other than the financial statements and our auditor's
report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the
extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is
materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit or
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material
misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial

- statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material
misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.
Other Companies Act 2006 reporting
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

. the information given in the Strategic report and the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and

. the Strategic report and the Directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal
requirements.

In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Company and its environment obtained in the course of
the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic report or the Directors’ report.

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006
tequires us to report to you if, in our opinion:

. adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been
received from branches not visited by us; or

° the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
. certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by taw are not made; or
. we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

Responsibilities of Directors

As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the Directors are responsible for the
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such
internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financia! statements that are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Company's ability to
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going
concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Company or to cease operations,
or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Learning Curve Group Limited

Independent Auditor's report to the members of Learning Curve Group Limited (continued)

Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

Extent to which the audit was capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures
in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities,
including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is
detailed below:

Non-compliance with laws and regulations

Based on:

e Our understanding of the Company and the industry in which it operates;

e Discussion with management and those charged with governance; and

¢ Obtaining and understanding of the Company's policies and procedures regarding compliance with laws and
regulations.

we considered the significant laws and regulations to be UK generally accepted accounting practice, the

Companies Act 2006 and UK tax legislation.

The Company is also subject to laws and regulations where the consequence of non-compliance could have a
material effect on the amount or disclosures in the financial statements, for example through the imposition of
fines or litigations. We identified such laws and regulations to be the requirements of OFSTED.

Our procedures in respect of the above included:

e Review of minutes of meeting of those charged with governance for any instances of non-compliance with
laws and regulations;

e Review of cortespondence with tax authorities and latest OFSTED reports for any instances of non-
compliance with laws and regulations;

e Review of financial statement disclosures and agreeing to supporting documentation; and

e Review of legal expenditure accounts to understand the nature of expenditure incurred.

Fraud

We assessed the susceptibility of the financial statements to material misstatement, including fraud. Our risk

assessment procedures included:

« Enquiry with management and those charged with governance regarding any known or suspected instances
of fraud;

e Obtaining an understanding of the Company's policies and procedures relating to:
° Detecting and responding to the risks of fraud; and
° Internal controls established to mitigate risks related to fraud.

« Review of minutes of meeting of those charged with governance for any known or suspected instances of
fraud;

e Discussion amongst the engagement team as to how and where fraud might occur in the financial
statements;

e Performing analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships that may indicate risks
of material misstatement due to fraud; and

e Considering group banking covenants in place and the associated financial statement areas which may
present a higher risk.

Based on our risk assessment, we considered the areas most susceptible to fraud to be revenue and
adjustments to EBITDA in respect of covenant calculations.

11

Learning Curve Group Limited

Independent Auditor's report to the members of Learning Curve Group Limited (continued)

Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements (continued)
Fraud (continued)

Our procedures in respect of the above included:

« Testing a sampie of journal entries throughout the year, which met a defined risk criteria, by agreeing to
supporting documentation;

e Testing revenue and accrued income for existence with a focus on year end cut off;

e Auditing the adjustments made in arriving at adjusted EBITDA to ensure they were in line with the lending
agreement.

We also communicated relevant identified laws and regulations and potential fraud risks to all engagement team
members who were all deemed to have appropriate competence and capabilities and remained alert to any
indications of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations throughout the audit.

Our audit procedures were designed to respond to risks of material misstatement in the financial statements,
recognising. that the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not
detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery,
misrepresentations or through collusion. There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures performed and the
further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the
financial statements, the less likely we are to become aware of it.

A further description of our responsibilities is available on the Financial Reporting Council's website at:
https:/Awww. frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.

Use of our report

This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company's members
those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest
extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the
Company's members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Going concern

The directors have reviewed detailed projections that have been produced to identify any potential
impact of high inflation, high interest rates and the cost of living crisis on the future financial
performance of the business up to and including January 2026.

The financial information reviewed by the Board includes a detailed profit and loss as well as cash
flow information together with the level of liquid resources available to the Group. The projections
have also been shared with lenders under the terms of the Group banking arrangement.

Further to the loss of AEB contracts after the last reporting date and tightening in the sub-contracting
regulations together with a continued high-interest rate environment the Group has had to renegotiate
with their lenders. This resulted in covenant waivers being obtained for April 2024, July 2024 and
October 2024, with a reset from January 2025. The new covenants provide the Group with sufficient
levels of headroom and trading results continue to improve. Agilitas, the Company's Ultimate Parent
Company, have also injected new equity into the business with £3.5m received in October 2024.

As part of this process a detailed forecast has been stress tested on the basis of a further reduction

in revenue with potential cost reduction mitigations also taken into account. The forecasts have been
teviewed against the new covenant requirements in place for the next 12 months and the business
has sufficient levels of headroom against its bank covenants. The cash position of the business is
also expected to be sufficient over the forecast period.

The going concern assessment has been made at group level and the directors have confirmed that
the group will provide financial support to the entity as required. Following this assessment the
directors are confident that the Company will continue for the foreseeable future and it is therefore
considered appropriate to prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis.

Turnover

Turnover comprises revenue recognised by the Company in respect of goods and services supplied
during the year, exclusive of Value Added Tax and trade discounts.

Turnover is primarily made up on income derived from the delivery of government funded training
programmes for 16 to 18 year old students and adult learners as well as provision of learning content
and recruitment services.

Turnover is recognised over the life of each training contract adjusted for the impact of upfront costs
and completion milestones. Turnover represents the amount of work done in the year including
amounts accrued at the year-end which are not yet invoiced. An appropriate reserve is made in
respect of expected withdrawals.

Operating leases: the Company as lessee

Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a
straight line basis over the lease term.

Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to sign an operating lease are recognised on a

straight line basis over the lease term, unless another systematic basis is representative of the time
pattern of the lessee's benefit from the use of the leased asset.

Pensions
Defined contribution pension plan

The Company operates a defined contribution plan for its employees. A defined contribution plan is a
pension plan under which the Company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. Once the
contributions have been paid the Company has no further payment obligations.

The contributions are recognised as an expense in the Statement of Comprehensive tncome when
they fall due. Amounts not paid are shown in accruals as a liability in the Statement of Financial
Position. The assets of the plan are held separately from the Company in independently administered
funds.

Government grants

Payments received from the government for furloughed employees are a form of grant. This grant
money is receivable as compensation for expenses already incurred, and where this is not in respect
of future related costs, is recognised in other income in the period in which it becomes receivable and
the related expense is incurred.

Current and deferred taxation

The tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in profit or loss
except that a charge attributable to an item of income and expense recognised as other
comprehensive income or to an item recognised directly in equity is also recognised in other
comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.

The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of tax rates and laws that have been
enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date in the countries where the Company operates
and generates income.

Deferred tax balances are recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not

reversed by the reporting, except that:

e The recognition of deferred tax assets is limited to the extent that it is probable that they will be
recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits; and

e Any deferred tax balances are reversed if and when all conditions for retaining associated tax
allowances have been met.

Deferred tax balances are not recognised in respect of permanent differences except in respect of
business combinations, when deferred tax is recognised on the differences between the fair values of
assets acquired and the future tax deductions available for them and the differences between the fair
values of liabilities acquired and the amount that will be assessed for tax. Deferred tax is determined
using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.

Accounting policies (continued)

2.9 Intangible assets

Intangible assets are initially recognised at cost. After recognition, under the cost model, intangible
assets are measured at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment
losses.

At each reporting date the Company assesses whether there is any indication of impairment. If such
indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is determined which is the higher of its fair
value less costs to sell and its value in use. An impairment loss is recognised where the carrying
amount exceeds the recoverable amount.

All intangible assets are considered to have a finite useful life. If a reliable estimate of the useful life
cannot be made, the useful life shall not exceed ten years.

The estimated useful lives range as follows:
Development costs - 2-4 years straight line

Development costs are costs associated with the development of internal systems and training
materials to provide services to learners.

2.10 Tangible fixed assets

Tangible fixed assets under the cost model are stated at historical cost less accumulated
depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Historical cost includes expenditure that is
directly attributable to bringing the asset to the tocation and condition necessary for it to be capable of
operating in the manner intended by management.

At each reporting date the Company assesses whether there is any indication of impairment. If such
indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is determined which is the higher of its fair
value less costs to sell and its value in use. An impairment loss is recognised where the carrying
amount exceeds the recoverable amount.

Depreciation is provided on the following basis:

Leasehold improvements - 10% straight line
Plant and machinery - 25-33% straight-line
Motor vehicles - 33% straight-line
Fixtures and fittings - 25-33% straight-line

Computer and office equipment - 10-33% straight-line

The assets’ residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted
prospectively if appropriate, or if there is an indication of a significant change since the last reporting
date. :

Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount
and are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.

2.11 Stocks

Stocks are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value after making due allowance for
obsolete and slow-moving stocks.

19

Learning Curve Group Limited

Notes to the Financial Statements
For the Year Ended 31 January 2024

Accounting policies (continued)
2.12 Debtors

Short-term debtors are measured at transaction price, fess any impairment. Loans receivable are
measured initially at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are measured subsequently at amortised
cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment.

2.13 Cash and cash equivalents

Cash is represented by cash in hand and deposits with financial institutions repayable without penalty
on notice of not more than 24 hours. Cash equivalents are highly tiquid investments that mature in no
more than three months from the date of acquisition and that are readily convertible to known
amounts of cash with insignificant risk of change in value.

2.14 Creditors

Short-term creditors are measured at the transaction price. Other financial liabilities, including bank
loans, are measured initially at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are measured subsequently at
amortised cost using the effective interest method.

2.15 Financial instruments

The Company only enters into basic financial instrument transactions that result in the recognition of
financial assets and liabilities like trade and other debtors and creditors, loans from banks and other
third parties, loans to related parties and investments in ordinary shares.

Debt instruments (other than those wholly repayable or receivable within one year), including loans
and other accounts receivable and payable, are initially measured at present value of the future cash
flows and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Debt instruments that
are payable or receivable within one year, typically trade debtors and creditors, are measured, initially
and subsequently, at the undiscounted amount of the cash or other consideration expected to be paid
or received. However, if the arrangements of a short-term instrument constitute a financing
transaction, like the payment of a trade debt deferred beyond normal business terms or in case of an
out-right short-term loan that is not at market rate, the financial asset or liability is measured, initially
at the present value of future cash flows discounted at a market rate of interest for a similar debt
instrument and subsequently at amortised cost, unless it qualifies as a loan from a director in the
case of a small company, or a public benefit entity concessionary loan.

Financial assets that are measured at cost and amortised cost are assessed at the end of each
reporting period for objective evidence of impairment. If objective evidence of impairment is found, an
impairment loss is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.

For financial assets measured at amortised cost, the impairment loss is measured as the difference
between an asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated cash flows discounted at the
asset's original effective interest rate. If a financial asset has a variable interest rate, the discount rate
for measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest rate determined under the
contract.

For financial assets measured at cost less impairment, the impairment loss is measured as the
difference between an asset's carrying amount and best estimate of the recoverable amount, which is
an approximation of the amount that the Company would receive for the asset if it were to be sold at
the reporting date.

2. Accounting policies (continued)
2.15 Financial instruments (continued)

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the Statement of Financial
Position when there is an enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an
intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

2.16 Impairment of fixed assets and goodwill

Assets that are subject to depreciation or amortisation are assessed at each reporting date to
determine whether there is any indication that the assets are impaired. Where there is any indication
that an asset may be impaired, the carrying value of the asset (or cash-generating unit to which the
asset has been allocated) is tested for impairment. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount
by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the
higher of an asset's (or CGU's) fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of
assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately
identifiable cash flows (CGUs). Non-financial assets that have been previously impaired are reviewed
at each reporting date to assess whether there is any indication that the impairment losses
recognised in prior periods may no longer exist or may have decreased.

3. Judgements in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty

The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities as at the reporting date and the
amounts reported for revenues and expenses during the year. However, the nature of estimation means
that actual outcomes could differ from those estimates. The following judgements (apart from those
involving estimates) have had the most significant effect on amounts recognised in the financial
statements.

The most significant area of judgement in the financial statements relates to amounts included within the
Statement of Financial Position relating to accrued income. The directors are satisfied that accrued
income balances are fully recoverable.

The useful life of intangibles is also an area of judgement that is reviewed. Intangible assets with indefinite
useful lives are tested for impairment annually, and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be
impaired. The directors are satisfied that the useful life of intangibles remains appropriate for the
Company.

The Company recharges an element of direct and indirect costs incurred to other companies in the Group.
The recharges are based on the judgement that all companies in the Group are delivering similar
education and training courses, so profit margins should reflect this.

The useful life of tangible fixed assets is also an area of judgement that is reviewed on a periodic basis.
Tangible fixed assets are depreciated over their useful lives, considering residual values where
appropriate. The actual lives of the assets are reviewed on an annual basis, based on several factors.

The directors assess any new leases entered into, to determine if they are finance or operating leases.

These decisions depend on an assessment of whether the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred
to the Company on a lease by lease basis.

Events after the reporting period

Further to the loss of AEB contracts and tightening in the sub-contracting regulations together with a
