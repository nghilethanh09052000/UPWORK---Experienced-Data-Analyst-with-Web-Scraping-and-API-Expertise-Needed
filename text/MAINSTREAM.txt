STRATEGIC REPORT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2024

The directors present their strategic report for the year ended 21 March 2024.

REVIEW OF BUSINESS

The year ending 31st March 2024 saw us maintain our position as one of the largest HGV Driver Training businesses in the UK,
principally delivering to HM Armed Forces and to the Department of Education, through the HGV Skills Bootcamp initiative aimed
at tackling the national HGV driver shortage. These two contracts which both run until at-lcast 31st March 2026, accounted for over
£9.8 million of a total turnover of just under £11 million, the balance attributable to Department of Education (DfE) Adult Education
Training, HM Prison Service and commercial training to the logistics sector.

During the year, in June 2023 we underwent a full five-day Ofsted inspection. Achieving an overall grade of GOOD, with
OUTSTANDING for Adult Learning Programmes, Quality of Education and Behaviour and Attitudes. This result was not only a
thoroughly deserved accolade to the hard work and quality of our delivery team, but it was also vital to enable us to continue to
deliver funded training for the Department for Education. The Board have subsequently built upon this excellent result by appointing
a new director to lead our approach to Safeguarding and Quality, the objective being to consolidate and further improve the quality of
our delivery to our learners

On an operational front we achieved more than 75% positive job outcomes for the graduates of our HGV Skills Bootcamp
programme, and we met all KPIs applicable to our HM Armed Forces contract.

During December 2023, we relocated from Mainstream House in Sittingbourne, a large and expensive industrial warehouse facility,
to more suitable and less expensive office premises in Maidstone, reducing our overheads by around £300k. The relocate better suits
our current activity profile and has been well received by both customers and our team. In addition to the office premises in
Maidstone, subsequent to the year-end we entered into a new 6 year lease to secure a dedicated HGV training and parking facility on
the Isle of Sheppey.

Our training business has consistently achieved an operating profit of more than £1 million for the last three financial years, and we
forecast an operating profit for the current year ending 31st March 2025 of a similar quantum,

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES

The directors consider that the company's principal risks are; changes to Government policy towards funded training, the loss of our
principal contracts which are subject to periodic competitive procurement, reduced recruitment numbers in the British Army, vehicle
fuel costs impacting on the cost of delivering HGV driver training and falling numbers of student eligible for funded training.

The directors manage these risks by constantly evaluating the sectors in which the group operates, by being alert to sector
developments, and by implementing decisive and rapid changes when required. We operate a strategy of actively pursuing
diversification into new operational sectors and expansion of our income base to reduce reliance upon current key contracts, we
achieve this by monitoring procurement announcements and tendering for suitable opportunities. The Board considers Mainstream's
key strength to be the quality of it delivery of adult education, principally HGV and logistics training, as such we will continue to
adopt of policy of only pursuing opportunitics that fall firmly into our area of expertise.

The directors recognise that the company's employees are key to delivering a high-quality service to its customers and the company
ensures that all staff are given the opportunity to develop their individual skills to operate to their full potential.

FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS
The directors constantly look to grow turnover by tendering for new contracts and retaining and increasing delivery to existing
customers. The company searches for new procured public contract opportunities and are actively engaged in the tendering process
for several current opportunities.

We are interested in expansion of our HGV training delivery to further regional sites throughout the UK, which could be through
acquisition or start-up.

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
The directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic Report, the Report of the Directors and the financial statements in
accordance with applicable law and regulations.

Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors have elected
to prepare the financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom
Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they
are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of the profit or loss of the company for that
period. In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:

- select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;

- make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;

- prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will continue in
business.

The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the company’s
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and enable them to ensure that
the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company
and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

STATEMENT AS TO DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO AUDITORS

So far as the directors are aware, there is no relevant audit information (as defined by Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006) of
which the company's auditors are unaware, and each director has taken all the steps that he or she ought to have taken as a director in
order to make himself or herself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the company's auditors are aware of that
information,

REPORT OF THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS TO THE MEMBERS OF
MAINSTREAM TRAINING LIMITED

Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Mainstream Training Limited (the 'company’) for the year ended 31 March 2024 which
comprise the Income Statement, Other Comprehensive Income, Balance Sheet, Statement of Changes in Equity and Notes to the
Financial Statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that has been
applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 102
‘The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland’ (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice).

Tn our opinion the financial statements:
- give a true and fair view of the state of the company's affairs as at 31 March 2024 and of its profit for the year then ended;
- have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and

- have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
section of our report. We are independent of the company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of
the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in
accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
basis for our opinion.

Conclusions relating to going concern
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the
preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that,
individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least
twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issuc.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this
report.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider
whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are
required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work
we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.

The other information comprises the information included in the annual report other than the financial statements and our Auditors’
report thereon. The Directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report. Our opinion on the

express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider
whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements, or our knowledge obtained in the course of the
audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements,
we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the
work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that
fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.

Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

- the information given in the Strategic Report and the Report of the Directors for the financial year for which the financial
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and

- the Strategic Report and the Report of the Directors have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

by us; or

- the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or

- certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or

- we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

Responsibilities of directors

As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors' Responsibilities set out on page four, the directors are responsible for the
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the
directors determine necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due
to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the company's ability to continue as a going concern,
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either
intend to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

REPORT OF THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS TO THE MEMBERS OF
MAINSTREAM TRAINING LIMITED

Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an Auditors' report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high
level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial
statements.

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our
responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud.

The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below:
Tow the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities including fraud

Our approach to identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including fraud and
non-compliance with laws and regulations, was as follows:

- we identified the laws and regulations applicable to the Company through discussions with management, and from our commercial
knowledge and experience of the industry and sector;

- we focused on specific laws and regulations which we considered may have a direct material effect on the accounts or the
operations of the Company;
- we assessed the extent of compliance with the laws and regulations identified above through making enquiries of management and
inspecting correspondence; and
- identified laws and regulations were communicated within the audit team and the team remained alert to instances of
non-compliance throughout the audit.

We assessed the susceptibility of the Company's accounts to material misstatement, including obtaining an understanding of how
fraud might occur, by:

- making enquiries of management as to where they considered there was susceptibility to fraud, their knowledge of actual, suspected
and alleged fraud; and
- considering the internal controls in place to mitigate risks of fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations.

To address the risk of fraud through management bias and override of controls, we:

- performed analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships;

- tested journal entries to identify unusual transactions;

- assessed whether judgements and assumptions made in determining the accounting estimates sct out in the accounting policies were
indicative of potential bias; and

- investigated the rationale behind significant or unusual transactions.

In response to the risk of irregularities and non-compliance with laws and regulations, we designed procedures which included, but
were not limited to:

- agreeing financial statement disclosures to underlying supporting documentation;
- reading minutes of meetings of those charged with governance; and
- enquiring of management as to actual and potential litigation and claims.

There are inherent limitations in our audit procedures described above. As a result there is a risk that we will not detect all
irregularities, including those leading to a material misstatement in the financial statements or non-compliance with regulation. This
risk increases the more that compliance with a law or regulation is removed from the events and transactions reflected in the financial
statements, as we will be less likely to become aware of instances of non-compliance. The risk is also greater regarding irregularities
occurring due to fraud rather than error, as fraud involves intentional concealment, forgery, collusion, omission or misrepresentation.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2024

1. STATUTORY INFORMATION

Mainstream Training Limited is a private company, limited by shares , registered in England and Wales. The company’s
registered number and registered office address can be found on the Company Information page.

The presentation currency of the financial statements is the Pound Sterling (£).

2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of preparing the financial statements

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102 "The Financial
Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland" and the Companies Act 2006. The financial statements
have been prepared under the historical cost convention.

Financial Reporting Standard 102 - reduced disclosure exemptions
The company has taken advantage of the following disclosure exemption in preparing these financial statements, as permitted
by FRS 102 "The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland”:

* the requirements of Section 7 Statement of Cash Flows.

Turnover
Turnover represents the provision of services from the principal activity, excluding value added tax.
Revenue for provision for services is recognised when the services have been rendered.

Tangible fixed assets
Depreciation is provided at the following annual rates in order to write off each asset over its estimated useful life or, if held
under a finance lease, over the lease term, whichever is the shorter.

All the assets with a useful life over one year and an acquisition cost of £500 or more are capitalised, and written off over
their useful life. As our trucks are used on training contracts, which are largely fixed terms, they are often written down to a
realistic residual value over the term of the contract. The depreciation methods vary between 25% reducing balance method,
and straight line method over various months. There is no generic write down policy, the directors (MGS and MPS) consider
each acquisition at time of purchase and set life and residual value at the outset.

Stocks

Stocks are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value, after making due allowance for obsolete and slow moving
items.

Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less any impairment.

Taxation

Taxation for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Income Statement, except to the extent that
it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.

Current or deferred taxation assets and liabilitics are not discounted.

Current tax is recognised at the amount of tax payable using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the balance sheet date.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - continued
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2024

2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date.

Timing differences arise from the inclusion of income and expenses in tax assessments in periods different from those in
which they are recognised in financial statements. Deferred tax is measured using tax rates and laws that have been enacted
or substantively enacted by the year end and that are expected to apply to the reversal of the timing difference.

Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that they will be
recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.

Hire purchase and leasing commitments

Assets obtained under hire purchase contracts or finance leases are capitalised in the balance sheet. Those held under hire
purchase contracts are depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Those held under finance leases are depreciated over
their estimated useful lives or the lease term, whichever is the shorter.

The interest element of these obligations is charged to profit or loss over the relevant period. The capital element of the future
payments is treated as a liability.

Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to profit or loss on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.

Pension costs and other post-retirement benefits

The company operates a defined contribution pension scheme. Contributions payable to the company's pension scheme are
charged to profit or loss in the period to which they relate. The amount recognised as an expense for the defined contribution
scheme was £61,447 (2023: £68,889).

Dividends
Interim dividends are recognised on payment.

2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued

Financial instruments
The Company has elected to apply the provisions of Section 11 "Basic Financial Instruments" of FRS 102 to all of its
financial instruments.

The Company only enters into basic financial instrument transactions that result in the recognition of financial asscts and
liabilities like trade and other debtors and creditors, loans from banks and other third parties, loans to related parties and
investments in ordinary shares.

Debt instruments (other than those wholly repayable or reccivable within one year), including loans and other accounts
receivable and payable, are initially measured at present value of the future cash flows and subsequently at amortised cost
using the effective interest method. Debt instruments that are payable or receivable within one year, typically trade debtors
and creditors, are measured, initially and subsequently, at the undiscounted amount of the cash or other consideration
expected to be paid or received. However, if the arrangements of a short-term instrument constitute a financing transaction,
like the payment of a trade debt deferred beyond normal business terms or in case of an out-right short-term loan that is not at
market rate, the financial asset or liability is measured, initially at the present value of future cash flows discounted at a
market rate of interest for a similar debt instrument and subsequently at amortised cost, unless it qualifies as a loan from a
director in the case of a small company, or a public benefit entity concessionary loan.

Financial assets that are measured at cost and amortised cost are assessed at the end of each reporting period for objective
evidence of impairment. If objective evidence of impairment is found, an impairment loss is recognised in the statement of
comprehensive income.

For financial assets measured at amortised cost, the impairment loss is measured as the difference between an asset's carrying
amount and the present value of estimated cash flows discounted at the asset's original effective interest rate. If a financial
asset has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest rate
determined under the contract.

For financial assets measured at cost less impairment, the impairment loss is measured as the difference between an asset's
carrying amount and best estimate of the recoverable amount, which is an approximation of the amount that the Company
