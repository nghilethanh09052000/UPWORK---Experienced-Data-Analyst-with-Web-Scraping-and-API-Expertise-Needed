Notes to the Financial Statements
for the Period Ended 31 August 2024
1. Accounting policies
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the provisions of Section 1A (Small Entities) of Financial Reporting Standard 102
Turnover policy
Turnover comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and provision of services in the ordinary course of the company's activities. Turnover is shown net of sales/value added tax, returns, rebates and discounts.
The company recognises revenue when:
the amount of revenue can be reliably measured;
it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity;
and specific criteria have been met for each of the company's activities.
Tangible fixed assets and depreciation policy
Tangible assets are stated in the balance sheet at cost, less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses.
The cost of tangible assets includes directly attributable incremental costs incurred in their acquisition and installation.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than land and properties under construction over their estimated useful lives, as follows:
Asset Class, Depreciation Method and Rate:
Furniture and Fittings, 15% on reducing balance.
Office Equipment, 15% on reducing balance.
Other accounting policies
Tax:
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in profit or loss, except that a change attributable to an item of income or expense recognised as other comprehensive income is also recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date in the countries where the company operates and generates taxable income.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences between taxable profits and profits reported in the financial statements.
Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised when it is probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.
Deferred tax is measured using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and that are expected to apply to the reversal of the timing difference.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and call deposits, and other short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value.
Trade Debtors
Trade debtors are amounts due from customers for merchandise sold or services performed in the ordinary course of business.
Trade debtors are recognised initially at the transaction price. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. A provision for the impairment of trade debtors is established when there is objective evidence that the company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
Stocks
Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell. Cost is determined using the first in, first out (FIFO) method.
The cost of finished goods and work in progress comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. At each reporting date, stocks are assessed for impairment. If stocks are impaired, the carrying amount is reduced to its selling price less costs to complete and sell; the impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Trade Creditors
Trade creditors are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if the company does not have an unconditional right, at the end of the reporting period, to defer settlement of the creditor for at least twelve months after the reporting date. If there is an unconditional right to defer settlement for at least twelve months after the reporting date, they are presented as non-current liabilities.
Trade creditors are recognised initially at the transaction price and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Borrowings
Interest-bearing borrowings are initially recorded at fair value, net of transaction costs. Interest-bearing borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised cost, with the difference between the proceeds, net of transaction costs, and the amount due on redemption being recognised as a charge to the profit and loss account over the period of the relevant borrowing.
Interest expense is recognised on the basis of the effective interest method and is included in interest payable and similar charges.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the company has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting date.
Share Capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Equity instruments are measured at the fair value of the cash or other resources received or receivable, net of the direct costs of issuing the equity instruments. If payment is deferred and the time value of money is material, the initial measurement is on a present value basis.
Dividends
Dividend distribution to the company's shareholders is recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the reporting period in which the dividends are declared.
