2 Accounting policies

Summary of significant accounting policies and key accounting estimates

The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These
policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.

Statement of compliance

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102 Section 1A
smaller entities - 'The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the United Kingdom and Republic of lreland' and the
Companies Act 2006 (as applicable to companies subject to the small companies’ regime).

Basis of preparation

These financial statements have been prepared using the historical cost convention except that as disclosed in the
accounting policies certain items are shown at fair value.

Revenue recognition

Turnover comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and provision of
services in the ordinary course of the company’s activities. Turnover is shown net of sales/value added tax, returns,
rebates and discounts.

The company recognises revenue when:

The amount of revenue can be reliably measured;

it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity;

and specific criteria have been met for each of the company's activities.

Tax

The tax expense for the period comprises deferred tax. Tax is recognised in profit or loss, except that a change
attributable to an item of income or expense recognised as other comprehensive income is also recognised directly in
other comprehensive income.

The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of tax rates and laws that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the reporting date in the countries where the company operates and generates taxable
income.

Page 4

Azesta Limited
Notes to the Unaudited Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2024

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences between taxable profits and profits reported in the
financial statements.

Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised when it is probable that they will be recovered
against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.

Deferred tax is measured using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the
reporting date and that are expected to apply to the reversal of the timing difference.

Tangible assets

Tangible assets are stated in the balance sheet at cost, less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and
subsequent accumulated impairment losses.

The cost of tangible assets includes directly attributable incremental costs incurred in their acquisition and installation.

Depreciation

Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than land and properties under construction over
their estimated useful lives, as follows:

Asset class Depreciation method and rate
Fixtures, fittings and office equipment 33% reducing balance
Motor vehicles 25% reducing balance

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and call deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments
that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value.

Trade debtors

Trade debtors are amounts due from customers for merchandise sold or services performed in the ordinary course of
business.

Trade debtors are recognised initially at the transaction price. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost
using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. A provision for the impairment of trade debtors is
established when there is objective evidence that the company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to
the original terms of the receivables.

Trade creditors

Trade creditors are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of
business from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if the company does not have an
unconditional right, at the end of the reporting period, to defer settlement of the creditor for at least twelve months
after the reporting date. If there is an unconditional right to defer settlement for at least twelve months after the
reporting date, they are presented as non-current liabilities.

Trade creditors are recognised initially at the transaction price and subsequently measured at amortised cost using
the effective interest method.

Borrowings

Page 5

Azesta Limited

Notes to the Unaudited Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2024

Interest-bearing borrowings are initially recorded at fair value, net of transaction costs. Interest-bearing borrowings are
subsequently carried at amortised cost, with the difference between the proceeds, net of transaction costs, and the
amount due on redemption being recognised as a charge to the profit and loss account over the period of the relevant
borrowing.

Interest expense is recognised on the basis of the effective interest method and is included in interest payable and
similar charges.

Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the company has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the
liability for at least twelve months after the reporting date.

Share capital

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Equity instruments are measured at the fair value of the cash or other
resources received or receivable, net of the direct costs of issuing the equity instruments. If payment is deferred and
the time value of money is material, the initial measurement is on a present value basis.

Dividends

Dividend distribution to the company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the
reporting period in which the dividends are declared.

Defined contribution pension obligation

A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which fixed contributions are paid into a pension fund and the
company has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions even if the fund does not hold sufficient
assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.

Contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as employee benefit expense when they are due. If
contribution payments exceed the contribution due for service, the excess is recognised as a prepayment.

3 Staff numbers

The average number of persons employed by the company (including directors) during the year, was 9 (2023 - 6).
