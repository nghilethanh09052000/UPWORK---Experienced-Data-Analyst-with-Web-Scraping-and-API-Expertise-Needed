Notes to the Financial Statements

for the Period Ended 30 September 2023

1. Accounting policies

Basis of measurement and preparation

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the provisions of Section |A (Small Entitics) of Financial
Reporting Standard 102

Turnover policy

Turnover is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods suppliedand services rendered, net of
discounts and Value Added Tax.Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership
havetransferred to the buyer (usually on despatch of the goods); the amount of revenue can be measuredreliably; it is probable that
the associated economic benefits will flow to the entity; and the costs incurredor to be incurred in respect of the transactions can be
measured reliably.

Tangible fixed assets depreciation policy

Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost or valuation of an asset, les: residual value,over the useful economic life of
that asset as follows:Fittings fixtures and equipment - 10% reducing balanceMotor vehicles - 20% reducing balancelf there is an
indication that there has been a significant change in depreciation rate, useful life orresidual value of tangible assets, the depreciation
is revised prospectively to reflect the new estimates.

Valuation information and policy

Stocks are measured at the lower of cost and estimated sclling price less costs to complete and sell.Cost includes all costs of
purchase, costs of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the stocksto their present location and condition

Other accounting policies

TaxationThe taxation expense represents the aggregate amount of current and deferred tax recognised in thereporting period. Tax is
recognised in the statement of comprehensive income, except to the extent thatit relates to items recognised in other comprehensive
income or directly in capital and reserves. In thiscase, tax is recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in capital and
reserves, respectively.Current tax is recognised on taxable profit for the current and past periods. Current tax is measured atthe
amounts of tax expected to pay or recover using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted orsubstantively enacted at the reporting
date. Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences at the reporting date. Unrelieved taxlosses and other deferred tax
asscts are recognised to the extent that it is probable that they will berecovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other
future taxable profits. Deferred tax ismeasured using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by
thereporting date that are expected to apply to the reversal of the timing difference.---------Tangible assetsTangible assets are initially
recorded at cost, and are subsequently stated at cost less any accumulateddepreciation and impairment losses.Any tangible assets
carricd at revalued amounts are recorded at the fair value at the date of revaluationless any subsequent accumulated depreciation and
subsequent accumulated impairment losses.An increase in the carrying amount of an asset as a result of a revaluation, is recognised
in othercomprehensive income and accumulated in capital and reserves, except to the extent it reverses arevaluation decrease of the
same asset previously recognised in profit or loss. A decrease in thecarrying amount of an asset as a result of revaluation is
recognised in other comprehensive income tothe extent of any previously recognised revaluation increase accumulated in capital and
reserves inrespect of that asset. Where a revaluation decrease exceeds the accumulated revaluation gainsaccumulated in capital and
reserves in respect of that asset, the excess shall be recognised in profit orloss.--------- ImpairmentA review for indicators of
impairment is carried out at each reporting date, with the recoverable amountbeing estimated where such indicators exist. Where the
carrying value exceeds the recoverableamount, the asset is impaired accordingly. Prior impairments are also revicwed for possible
reversal ateach reporting date. When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, an estimate is madeof
the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. The cash-generatingunit is the smallest identifiable
group of assets that includes the asset and generates cash inflows thatare largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or
groups of assets,--------- Financial instrumentsA financial asset or a financial liability is recognised only when the company becomes
a party to thecontractual provisions of the instrument. Basic financial instruments are initially recognised at the transaction price,
unless the arrangementconstitutes a financing transaction, where it is recognised at the present value of the future
paymentsdiscounted at a market rate of interest for a similar debt instrument.Debt instruments are subsequently measured at
amortised cost. Where investments in non-convertible preference shares and non-puttable ordinary shares orpreference shares are
publicly traded or their fair value can otherwise be measured reliably, theinvestment is subsequently measured at fair value with
changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss.All other such investments are subsequently measured at cost less impairment.Other
financial instruments, including derivatives, are initially recognised at fair value, unless paymentfor an asset is deferred beyond
normal business terms or financed at a rate of interest that is not amarket rate, in which case the asset is measured at the present value
of the future paymentsdiscounted at a market rate of interest for a similar debt instrument.Other financial instruments are
subsequently measured at fair value, with any changes recognised inprofit or loss, with the exception of hedging instruments in a
designated hedging relationship.Financial assets that are measured at cost or amortised cost are reviewed for objective evidence
ofimpairment at the end of each reporting date. If there is objective evidence of impairment, animpairment loss is recognised in profit
or loss immediately.For all equity instruments regardless of significance, and other financial assets that are individuallysignificant,
these are assessed individually for impairment. Other financial assets or either assessedindividually or grouped on the basis of similar


credit risk characteristics. Any reversals of impairment are recognised in profit or loss immediatcly, to the extent that the reversaldocs
not result in a carrying amount of the financial asset that exceeds what the carrying amount wouldhave been had the impairment not
previously been recognised.------- Defined contribution plansContributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as an expense
in the period in which therelated service is provided. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that
theprepayment will lead to a reduction in future payments or a cash refund. When contributions are not expected to be settled wholly
within 12 months of the end of the reportingdate in which the employees render the related service, the liability is measured on a
discountedpresent value basis. The unwinding of the discount is recognised in finance costs in profit or loss in theperiod in which it
arises.
