, registered in England and Wales. The

STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the provisions of Section 1A "Small
Entities" of Financial Reporting Standard 102 "The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK
and Republic of Ireland" and the Companies Act 2006.
The significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out
below. These policies have been consistently applied to all years presented unless otherwise stated.
3.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of preparing the financial statements
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of certain assets.
Turnover
Turnover represents income received for the fulfilment of apprenticeship training programmes and is
recognised as earned over each contract.
Tangible fixed assets
Depreciation is provided at the following annual rates in order to write off each asset over its estimated useful life.
Land and buildings
-
in accordance with the property
Plant and machinery etc
-
25% on reducing balance, 15% on reducing balance and in accordance with the property
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost (or deemed cost) or valuation less accumulated depreciation
and accumulated impairment losses.
Cost includes costs directly attributable to making the asset
capable of operating as intended.
Government grants
Government grants are recognised at the fair value of the asset received or receivable when there is
reasonable assurance that the company will comply with conditions attaching to them and the grants
will be received using the accrual model.
Stocks
Stocks are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value, after making due allowance for
obsolete and slow moving items.
Financial instruments
Debtors
Short term debtors are measured at transaction price less impairment losses for bad and doubtful
debts.
Creditors
Short term trade creditors are measured at the transaction price. Other financial liabilities, including
bank loans, are measured initially at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are measured
subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method unless the effect of discounting
would be immaterial, in which case these are stated at cost.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued
Taxation
Taxation for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Income Statement,
except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in
equity.
Current or deferred taxation assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Current tax is recognised at the amount of tax payable using the tax rates and laws that have been
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at
the balance sheet date.
Timing differences arise from the inclusion of income and expenses in tax assessments in periods
different from those in which they are recognised in financial statements. Deferred tax is measured
using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the year end and that are
expected to apply to the reversal of the timing difference.
Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable
that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.
Pension costs and other post-retirement benefits
The company operates a defined contribution pension scheme.
Contributions payable to the
company's pension scheme are charged to profit or loss in the period to which they relate.
Leasing
Rentals payable and receivable under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a
straight line basis over the period of the lease.
