NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023

1. STATUTORY INFORMATION

Supply Chain Academy Limited is a private company, limited by shares , registered in England and Wales. The company's
registered number and registered office address can be found on the Company Information page.

The presentation currency of the financial statements is the Pound Sterling (£).

2. STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102 "The Financial Reporting
Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland" including the provisions of Section 1A "Small Entities" and the Companies
Act 2006.

3. ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of preparing the financial statements
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.

Related party exemption

The company has taken advantage of exemption, under the terms of Financial Reporting Standard 102 ‘The Financial Reporting
Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland’, not to disclose related party transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries
within the group.

Revenue recognition
Turnover is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, excluding discounts, rebates, value added tax
and other sales taxes.

For training courses, revenue is recognised in the period that the course is delivered and completed.

For directly funded apprenticeships, 80% of the revenue is recognised over the period of the learning and 20% is recognised at
the point that apprenticeship is completed.

Taxation
Taxation for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Income Statement, except to the extent that it
relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.

Current or deferred taxation assets and liabilities are not discounted.

Current tax is recognised at the amount of tax payable using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the balance sheet date.

The GB Europe Holdings Limited group offsets its corporation tax profits against the losses of other entities within the group via
group relief as permitted by the UK tax legislation. No payment is made where such relief is claimed.

The company is party to group transactions where transfer pricing regulations apply. A formal transfer pricing review is in
progress which may impact the tax treatment of group transactions. Should adjustment for transfer pricing result, then any
group entity with additional tax liability will be campensated by the group entity with reduced tax liability.

Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date.

Timing differences arise from the inclusion of income and expenses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which
they are recognised in financial statements. Deferred tax is measured using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the year end and that are expected to apply to the reversal of the timing difference.

Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that they will be
recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.

Pension costs and other post-retirement benefits
The company operates a defined contribution pension scheme. Contributions payable to the company's pension scheme are
charged to profit or loss in the period to which they relate.

4. EMPLOYEES AND DIRECTORS

The average number of employees during the year was 14 (2022 - NIL) .
