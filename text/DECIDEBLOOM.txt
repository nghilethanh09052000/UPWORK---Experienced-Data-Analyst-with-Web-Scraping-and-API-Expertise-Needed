STRATEGIC REPORT
FOR THE PERIOD ENDED 28 APRIL 2024

The directors present the strategic report for the Period ended 28 April 2024.

Principal Activities
The principal activities of the company during the year were the sale, repair and servicing of new and used motor
vehicles.

Industry Overview

The UK new car market increased 17.9% during the 2023 calendar year to 1.903 million (2022 : 1.61 million units)
with growth being driven entirely by fleet investment whilst private consumer demand remained stable at 817,613
units. In the four months to April 2024 market growth slowed down with 679,822 registrations representing an 8 4%
rise compared to the same period in 2023.

Battery electric vehicles (BEV) accounted for one in six new car registrations with the majority taken by business
and fleet buyers who benefit from significant tax incentives. {n contrast only one in eleven private buyers chose a
BEV.

With mainstream consumer demand fiat the industry is, calling on government to support private buyers with
incentives such as halving VAT on new BEV's for three years whilst also providing funding for UK wide charging
infrastructure. .

Used vehicle values dropped significantly in Q4 2023 due to increasing new supply and a price realignment after the
high prices experienced following the Covid pandemic. Values have now stabilised and demand for internal
combustion engine vehicles will remain healthy due to the lack of incentive for the retailer buyer to transfer to BEV
ownership.

Financial Performance
The directors are pleased to report a pre-tax profit for the period of £16.8m (2023: £24.8m) with turnover increasing
to £1.39 billion (2023: £1.35 billion).

The company’s balance sheet has continued to strengthen, with shareholders’ funds increasing from £151m at 30%
April 2023 to £163m at 28" April 2024. .

The company’s key performance indicators are :

STRATEGIC REPORT (CONTINUED)
FOR THE PERIOD ENDED 28 APRIL 2024

Business Review
Stoneacre Motor Group now operates from 64 locations across England and Wales and has 148 franchise sales
points representing 26 manufacturers.

During the period the group sold 26,601 new retail units (2023 : 24,581 units) and 31,395 used retail units (2023 :
31,532 units). New vehicle supply has returned to ‘normal’ levels following the pandemic with gross profit margins
increasing by 8%. Used vehicles sales have remained static and margins have reduced 11.8% in the year due to
the significant price correction in the final quarter of 2023. .

The Group's service department operations have continued to develop with revenues rising by 5% whilst margins
have been under pressure due to increased labour and courtesy vehicle costs. The company’s seven-day shift
system, with technicians working four days on four days off, which was introduced a year ago has proved to be
successful and is being rolled out across the group where customer demand dictates.

The company's accident repair centres have continued to benefit from the acquisition of new work providers,
investment in modern technologies and efficiency initiatives. These actions have resulted in an 8.1% increase in
turnover and a 44,6% increase in net profit.

The company's parts distribution division, Trade Parts Express (TPX), continues to prosper grow. Additional TPX
facilities were opened in Blackburn, Cleckheaton and York during the period and there are plans to open a further
TPX based in Peterborough in the first quarter of 2025.

Stoneacre's vehicle auction business which is based in Newark has produced another record breaking
performance, auctioning 31082 vehicles (2023 : 29271 vehicles) in the period. The company has invested £795k to
modernise its fleet of transport vehicles and has also improved storge facilities to increase vehicle capacity.

Due to the success of our last 12 months, Stoneacre Academy has now expanded offering an additional training
centre in Doncaster and a standalone EV and FGas centre in Thome.

We have adapted our curriculum to be proactive to Industry changes and are always staying ahead of the curve.
Our tutors are already Hydrogen and ADAS Level 1 qualified and we have introduced these qualifications inte the
new curriculum for our apprentices. Along with FGas Level 3, EV Level 1 & 2 within their first 2 years and
progression into year 3 will include EV Level 3.

We are offering a further 70 Aftersales apprenticeships that cover both productive and non-productive roles this
summer. Supporting Equality, Diversity and Inclusion to engage with the best talent and building an exceptional
diverse workforce needed to succeed.

During the year the company continued investing in its facilities in order to comply with manufacturers latest
corporate specifications. The refurbishment programme included two Kia, two Mazda, one Volvo, one Toyota and
one Lexus site. All materials used in the refurbishment process are energy efficient and designed to reduce the
mpact the company has on the environment. The company also continued installing and upgrading its EV charging
infrastructure.

STRATEGIC REPORT (CONTINUED)
FOR THE PERIOD ENDED 28 APRIL 2024

Principal Risks and Uncertainties
The main risks are set out below but are not an exhaustive list of risks and uncertainties which could affect the
company's performance,

Economic conditions : The Group's performance could be affected by factors such as inflationary pressures, interest
rates and labour shortages. Recent disruption to global new car supply has resulted a significantly reduced number
of new car registrations which, in turn, has impacted the number of used cars in the market place and our ability to
sources inventory.

Regulatory Compliance Risk : The Group is subject to increasing regulation and compliance requirements,
examples of which are as follows: Financial Conduct Authority, Trading Standards and General Data Protection
Regulations. The directors are fully aware of these risks and are regularly updated by the group's compliance officer
who has a seat on the board.

Manufacturer relationships : Dealership performance is influenced by the performance and strategy of the
manufacturer they represent. The risk is mitigated by the group representing 26 different franchises, working closely
with our manufacturer partners and maintaining profitable used vehicle operations.

A significant number of manufacturers are introducing an ‘Agency Model’ (Direct to customer new car sales). The
group represents only one manufacturer which has introduced this model and is committed to making this a
success,

Liquidity : The company finances its business using a mixture of retained profit, trade credit and funding facilities
provided by Lloyds bank and Lombard. It is considered that the facilities in place are adequate for the short to
medium term plans of the company. Profitability could be affected by movements in interest rates however low
levels of borrowing mean that there is minimal risk to the company for the foreseeable future.

Statement by the directors in performance of their statutory duties in accordance with $172(1) Companies
Act 2006

The Board of Directors of Stoneacre Limited consider, both individually and together, that they have acted in the
way they consider would be most likely to promote the success of the Group for the benefit of its members as a
whole (having regard to the stakeholders and matters set out in s 172(1) (a)-(f) of the Companies Act 2006.) in the
decisions taken during the period ended 28" April 2024,

. Our plan was designed to have a long term beneficial impact on the Group and to contribute to its success in
delivering a high quality of service across all business divisions.

. Our team members are fundamental to the delivery of our plan. We aim to be a responsible employer in our
approach to the pay and benefits our team members receive. The health, safety and well-being of our team
members is one of our primary considerations in the way we do business.

. Engagement with suppliers and customers is key to our success. We meet with our major Manufacturing partners
regularly throughout the year and take appropriate action, when necessary, to prevent involvement in modern
slavery, corruption, bribery and breaches of competition law.

. Our plan took into account the impact of the Group's operations on the community and environment and our wider
social responsibilities, and in particular how we. comply with environmental legislation and pursue waste-saving
opportunities and react to local community concerns.

. As the Board of Directors, our intention is to behave responsibly and ensure that the management operate the
business in a responsible manner, operating with the high standards of business conduct and good governance
expected for a business such as ours and in doing so, will contribute to the delivery of our plan. The intention is to
nurture our reputation, through both the construction and delivery of our plan, that reflects our responsible
behaviour.

Qualifying third party indemnity provisions
The company has made qualifying third party indemnity provisions for the benefit of its directors during the Period.
These provisions remain in force at the reporting date.

Financial instruments

Liquidity risk |

Liquidity risk arises from the Company's management of working capital and the finance charges and principal
tepayments on its debt instruments. It is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial
obligations as they fall due. The directors monitor this risk via the preparation of regular cash flow forecasts so they
can assess whether they need to use any funding lines they have access to.

Cash flow interest rate risk
The Company is exposed to cash flow interest rate risk from long-term borrowings at variable rates. During the
periods under review, the Company's borrowings at variable rate were denominated in Sterling.

Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to

meet its contractual obligations. The Company is mainly exposed to credit risk from credit sales. It is Company
policy, implemented locally, to assess the credit risk of new customers before entering contracts. Such credit ratings
are taken into account by local business practices. Each new customer is analysed individually for creditworthiness
‘before the Company's standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered. Purchase limits are
established for each customer, which represents the maximum open amounts without requiring approval.

Disabled persons

Applications for employment by disabled persons are always fully considered, bearing in mind the aptitudes of the
applicant concerned. In the event of members of staff becoming disabled, every effort is made to ensure that their
employment within the company continues and that the appropriate training is arranged. It is the policy of the
company that the training, career development and promotion of disabled persons should, as far as possible, be
identical to that of other employees.

following channels:

« Group performance and results are communicated to colleagues via the company's staff magazine
“Stoneacre Life".

« Industry specific technical updates are made available to all staff using the group's online training portal
which is designed to be both educational and informative.

encourages dialogue which gives all staff the opportunity to promote their own idéas and opinions.

a way consistent with our core values which cover how we interact with all stakeholders including shareholders,
employees, customers, suppliers and the wider community in the areas that we operate.

We have not adopted a specific corporate governance framework during the year and the board will continue to
monitor the development of private company corporate governance before deciding on whether it would be
beneficial to adopt a specific corporate governance code.

Our corporate governance arrangements are set out below:

Purpose and leadership

UK's fastest growing and most successful car dealers.

experience to deliver effective leadership and appropriate governance. The board of Directors meet on a regular
basis to monitor business performance and agree appropriate actions.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF DECIDEBLOOM LIMITED

Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of Decidebloom Limited (the 'company’) for the Period ended 28 April
2024 which comprise the profit and loss account, the balance sheet, the statement of changes in equity and notes
to the financial statements, including significant accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that has been
applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including Financial
Reporting Standard 102 The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of treland (United
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

In our opinion the financial statements: ;
+ give a true and fair view of the state of the company’s affairs as at 28 April 2024 and of its profit for the Period
then ended;
- have beén properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
+ have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable
law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Audifor's responsibilities for the audit of
the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the company in accordance with the ethical
réquirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial. statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical
Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe
that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Conclusions relating to going concern
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of
accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or
conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going
concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concefn are described in the
televant sections of this report. ~

Other information

The other information comprises the. information included in the annual report other than the financial statements
and our auditor's report thereon.:The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual
teport. Our opinion on the financial statements does riot cover, the other information and, except to the extent
otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. Our
tesponsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially
inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears
to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are
required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If,
based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstaternent of this other information,
we are required to report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.

Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of our audit:
. + the information given in the strategic report and the directors' report for the financial Period for which the
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
+ the strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal
Tequirements.

DECIDEBLOOM LIMITED

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT (CONTINUED)
TO THE MEMBERS OF DECIDEBLOOM LIMITED

Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the company. and its environment obtained in the course of the
audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report.

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires
us to report to you if, in our opinion:
« adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received
from branches not visited by us; or
« the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
+ certain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or
+ we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

Responsibilities of directors

As explained more fully in the directors' responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation
of the financial statements and far being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internat control as
the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for.
assessing the company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the company
or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance
with 1SAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or
error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in
line with our-responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including
fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below.

We obtained an understanding of the tegal and regulatory framework applicable to both the company itself and the
industry in which it operates. We identified areas of laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have
a material effect on the financial statements from our sector experience and through discussion with the directors
and other management. The most significant were identified as the Companies Act 2006, UK GAAP (FRS102) and
relevant tax legislation, and FCA regulations in relation to the sale of financial and insurance products. We
considered the extent of compliance with those laws and regulations as part of our procedures on the related
financial statements. Our audit procedures included:

« confirming with the directors and management whether they have any knowledge or suspicion of fraud;

+ obtaining an understanding of the internal controls established to mitigate risks related to fraud or non-
compliance with laws and regulations;

« assessing the risk of management override including identifying and testing a sample of journal entries;

« challenging the assumptions and judgements made by management in its significant account estimates in
particular the net realisable, value of stock held at the balance sheet date, and the other estimates they
have been required to make;

. undertaking procedures to review the process around monitoring compliance with FCA regulations and
inquiring as to whether there have been any instances of non-compliance in the period;

+ assessing when revenue is recognised, particularly focusing on revenue recognised in the days before and
after the year end date, and whether it was recognised in the correct period.

Our audit did not identify any significant risks relating to the detection of irregularities including fraud. However,
despite the audit being planned and conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) there remains an unavoidable risk that
material misstatements in the financial statements may not be detected owing to inherent limitations of the audit,
and that by their very nature, any such instances of fraud or irregularity likely involve collusion, forgery, intentional
misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.

Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland” (‘FRS 102”) and the requirements of the Companies
Act 2006.

The financial statements are prepared in sterling, which is the functional currency of the company. Monetary
amounts in these financial statements are rounded to the nearest £000.

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, modified to include the
revaluation of freehold properties and to include investment properties and certain financial instruments at fair
value. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.

This company is a qualifying entity for the purposes of FRS 102, being a member of a group where the parent
of that group prepares publicly available consolidated financial statements, including this company, which are
intended to give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the group.
The company has therefore taken advantage of exemptions from the following disclosure requirements:

+ Section 7 ‘Statement of Cash Flows’: Presentation of a statement of cash flow and related notes and
disclosures;

+ Section 11 ‘Basic Financial Instruments’ and Section 12, 'Other Financial Instrument Issues: The
disclosure requirements of paragraphs 11.42, 11.44, 11.45, 11.47, 11.48(a)(iii), 11.48(a)(iv), 11.48(b),
11.48(c), 12.26, 12.27, 12.29(a), 12.29(b), and 12.29A;

+ Section 26 ‘Share based Payment’: Share based payment arrangements required under FRS 102
paragraphs 26.18(b), 26.19 to 26.21 and 26.23;

« Section 33 ‘Related Party Disclosures’: Compensation for key management personnel.

The financial statements of the company are consolidated in the financial statements of Stoneacre Limited.
These consolidated financial statements are available from its registered office, Omega Boulevard, Thorne,
Doncaster, South Yorkshire, DN8 STX.

Going concern

The company continues to, rely on relationships with its manufacturer partners and the wider financial
resources of the Stoneacre Group. Costs are closely monitored and controlled and the company also has
unencumbered assets which could be leveraged if additional funds were required.

The company is fortunate that it has available headroom in facilities alongside a strong balance sheet..As a
consequence, the Directors are confident that the company has sufficient liquidity.

On this basis and at the time of approving the financial statements, the Directors have a reasonable
expectation that the company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable
future. Thus the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial
statements.

Accounting policies (Continued)

Turnover

Turnover is measured at invoice price, excluding value added taxes, and principally comprises external
vehicle sales, parts, servicing and bodyshop sales. Vehicles and parts sales are recognised when control over
the vehicles or parts have been transferred. to the customer. This is generally at the time of delivery to/
collection by the customer. Service and bodyshop sales are recognised in line of delivery to/collection by the
customer. Service and bodyshop sales are recognised in line with the work performed.

Revenue also comprises commission receivable for arranging vehicle finance and related insurance products.
Commissions are based on agreed rates and income is recognised at the time of approval of the vehicle
finance by the finance provider.

Where the Company is acting as an agent on behalf of a principal, the commission eamed is also recorded at
an agreed rate when the transaction has occurred, The income received in respect of warranty policies sold
and administered by the Company is recognised over the period of the policy on a straight-line basis. The
unrecognised income is included within deferred income.

Commercial income

Commercial income, including manufacturer bonuses, are credited to cost of sales. Volume related and
specific vehicle rebates from suppliers are credited to the carrying value of the stock to which they relate until
the related stock is sold. Once the stock is sold, the rebate amount is then recognised in the income
statement within cost of safes.

Interest income
Interest income is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income using the effective interest method.

Guarantee and Maintenance income

The income received in respect of Guarantee and Maintenance policies sold and administered by the
Company is recognised at the start of the policy net of any provision require to cover the liability under the
terms of the policy. The provision for costs is included within liabilities.

Intangible fixed assets - goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition of unincorporated businesses over the fair value of
net assets acquired. It is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less
accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is considered to have a finite useful
life and is amortised on a systematic basis over its expected life, which is 5 years.

For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the cash-generating units expected to benefit
from the acquisition. Cash-generating units to which goodwilt has been allocated are tested for impairment at
least annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable
amount of the cash-generating unit is léss than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is
allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets
of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.

Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost or valuation, net of
depreciation and any impairment losses.

Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over their
useful lives on the following bases: .

Leasehold [and and buildings Over the period of the lease
Plant and equipment 20% per annum straight line
Fixtures and fittings 20% per annum straight line
Motor vehicles 20% per annum straight line

Accounting policies . (Continued)
Land which is included within Freehold tand and buildings is not depreciated.

The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the sale proceeds
and the carrying value of the asset, and is credited or charged to profit or loss.

Impairment of fixed assets

At each reporting period end date, the company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible
assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any
such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the
impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset,
the company estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.

Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use,
the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the
estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.

If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be tess than its carrying
amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An
impairment toss is recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued
amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.

Recognised impairment losses are reversed if, and only if, the reasons for the impairment loss have ceased to
apply. Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating
unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount
does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been
recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is
recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which
case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.

Stocks

Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell. Cost
comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been
incurred in bringing the stocks to their present location and condition.

Stocks held for distribution at no or nominal consideration are measured at the lower of cost and replacement
cost, adjusted where applicable for any loss of service potential.

At each reporting date, an assessment is made for impairment. Any excess of the carrying amount of stocks
over its estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell is recognised as an impairment loss in profit or
loss, Reversals of impairment losses are also recognised in profit or toss.

Vehicles on consignment from manufacturers that are subject to interest or other charges are included in
stock at cost when there has been a substantial transfer of the risks and rewards of ownership. The
associated liability is recorded in creditors.

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash is represented by cash in hand and deposits with financial institutions repayable without penalty on
notice of not more than 24 hours. Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments that mature in no more than
three months from the date of acquisition that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash with
insignificant risk of change in value.

Accounting policies (Continued)

Financial instruments
The company has elected to apply the provisions of Section 11 ‘Basic Financial Instruments’ and Section 12
‘Other Financial Instruments Issues’ of FRS 102 to all of its financial instruments.

Financial instruments are recognised in the company's balance sheet when the company becomes party to
the contractual provisions of the instrument.

Financial assets and liabilities are. offset, with the net amounts presented in the financial statements, when
there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net
basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Basic financial assets

Basic financial assets, which include debtors and cash and bank balances, are initially measured at
transaction price including transaction costs and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective
interest method, unless the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where the transaction is
measured at the present value of the future receipts discounted at a market rate of interest. Financial assets
classified as receivable within one year are not amortised.

Other financial assets .

Other financial assets, including investments in equity instruments which are not subsidiaries, associates or
joint ventures, are initially measured at fair value, which is normally the transaction price. Such assets are
subsequently carried at fair value and the changes in fair value are recognised in profit or loss, except that
investments in equity instruments that are not publicly traded and whose fair values cannot be measured
reliably are measured at cost less impairment.

Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets, other than those held at fair value through profit and loss, are assessed for indicators of
impairment at each reporting end date.

Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that
occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows have been affected.
if an asset is impaired, the impairment loss is the difference between the carrying amount and the present
value of the estimated cash flows discounted at the asset's origina! effective interest rate. The impairment loss
is recognised in profit or loss.

If there is a decrease in the impairment loss arising from an event occurring after the impairment was
recognised, the impairment is reversed. The reversal is such that the current carrying amount does not
exceed what the carrying amount would have been, had the impairment not previously been recognised. The
impairment reversal is recognised in profit or loss.

Derecognition of financial assets

Financial assets are derecognised only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or
are settled, or when the company transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership to another entity, or if some significant risks and rewards of ownership are retained but control of
the asset has transferred to another party that is able to sell the asset in its entirety to an unrelated third party.

Classification of financial liabilities ©

Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual
arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the
assets of the company after deducting all of its liabilities.

Accounting policies (Continued)

Basic financial liabilities

Basic financial liabilities, including creditors, bank loans, loans from fellow group companies and preference
shares that are classified as debt, are initially recognised at transaction price unless the arrangement
constitutes a financing transaction, where the debt instrument is measured at the present value of the future
payments discounted at a market rate of interest. Financial liabilities classified as payable within one year are
not amortised.

Debt instruments are subsequently carried at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.

Trade creditors are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of
business from suppliers. Amounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year
or less. If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities. Trade creditors are recogniséd initially at
transaction price and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

Other financial liabilities

Derivatives, including interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts, are not basic financial
instruments. Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into
and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognised
in profit or loss in finance costs or finance income as appropriate, unless hedge accounting is applied and the
hedge is a cash flow hedge.

Debt instruments that do not meet the conditions in FRS 102 paragraph 11.9 are subsequently measured at
fair value through profit or loss. Debt instruments may be designated as being measured at fair value through
profit or loss to eliminate or reduce an accounting mismatch or if the instruments are measured and their
performance evaluated on a fair value basis in accordance with a documented risk management or
investment strategy.

Derecognition of financial liabilities

Financial liabilities are dérecognised when the company’s contractual obligations expire or are discharged or
cancelled.

Equity instruments .

Equity instruments issued by the company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of transaction costs.
Dividends payable on equity instruments are recognised as liabilities once they are no longer at the discretion
of the company.

Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.

Current tax

The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as
reported in the profit and loss account because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or
deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The company's
liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the
reporting end date. .

Deferred tax

Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all timing differences and deferred tax assets are
tecognised to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax
liabilities or other future taxable profits. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the timing difference
arises from goodwill or from the initial. recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects
neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting end. date and reduced to the extent
that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be
recovered. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability
is settled or the. asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the profit and loss account, except
when it relates to iterns charged or creditéd directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with
in equity. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the company has a legally enforceable right to
offset current tax assets and liabilities and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the

same tax authority.

Employee benefits
The costs of short-term employee benefits are recognised as a liability and an expense, unless those costs
are required to be recognised as part of the cost of stock or fixed assets.

The cost of any unused holiday entitlement is recognised in the period in which the employee's services are
received.

Termination benefits are recognised immediately as an expense when the company is demonstrably
committed to terminate the employment of an employee or to provide termination benefits.

Retirement benefits
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown as either

accruals or prepayments.

Foreign exchange

Transactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing at the
dates of the transactions. At each’ reporting end date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in
foreign currencies. are fetranslated at the rates prevailing on the reporting end date. Gains and losses arising
on transiation in the period are included in profit or loss.

2 Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty

In the application of the company’s accounting policies, the directors are required-to make judgements,
estimates and assumptions about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other
factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting
estimates aré recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised where the revision affects only that
period, or in the period of the revision and future periods where the revision affects both current and future
periods.

The main estimates which the directors consider to have a significant impact on the financial statements are
as follow:

Stocks

Consideration has been given by the directors to the level of provision against vehicle stocks. The key
assumption involves estimating the likely sale period and the expected profit or loss on sale for each of the
vehicles in stock at the year end. In determining the provision required the directors have used guidance from
independent valuation tools, historical experience and their knowledge of the industry.

Other

There are other amounts, included within accruals, which have required the directors to estimate their
amounts as they are dependent on a number of variable future events. In making these estimates the
directors have used historic trends on the assumption that the future trends for these items will follow historic
patterns. :
