Notes to the Accounts
for the period from 31 March 2023 to 29 March 2024

1 Accounting policies

Basis of preparation

The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with
FRS 102, The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland (as
applied to small entities by section 1A of the standard).

Turnover

Turnover is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of
discounts and value added taxes. Turnover includes revenue earned from the sale of goods
and from the rendering of services. Turnover from the sale of goods is recognised when the
significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have transferred to the buyer. Turnover
from the rendering of services is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the
contract. The stage of completion of a contract is measured by comparing the costs incurred
for work performed to date to the total estimated contract costs.

Tangible fixed assets

Tangible fixed assets are measured at cost less accumulative depreciation and any
accumulative impairment losses. Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets, other
than freehold land, at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of
each asset evenly over its expected useful life, as follows:

Plant and machinery 15% Reducing Balance

Stocks

Stocks are measured at the lower of cost and estimated selling price less costs to complete
and sell. Cost is determined using the first in first out method. The carrying amount of stock
sold is recognised as an expense in the period in which the related revenue is recognised.

Debtors

Short term debtors are measured at transaction price (which is usually the invoice price), less
any impairment losses for bad and doubtful debts. Loans and other financial assets are initially
recognised at transaction price including any transaction costs and subsequently measured at
amortised cost determined using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses for
bad and doubtful debts.

Creditors

Short term creditors are measured at transaction price (which is usually the invoice price).
Loans and other financial liabilities are initially recognised at transaction price net of any
transaction costs and subsequently measured at amortised cost determined using the effective
interest method.

Taxation

A current tax liability is recognised for the tax payable on the taxable profit of the current and
past periods. A current tax asset is recognised in respect of a tax loss that can be carried back
to recover tax paid in a previous period. Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing
differences between the recognition of income and expenses in the financial statements and

their inclusion in tax assessments. Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are
recognised only to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered against the reversal
of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits. Deferred tax is measured using the tax
rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and that
are expected to apply to the reversal of the timing difference, except for revalued land and
investment property where the tax rate that applies to the sale of the asset is used. Current and
deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.

Provisions

Provisions (ie liabilities of uncertain timing or amount) are recognised when there is an
obligation at the reporting date as a result of a past event, it is probable that economic benefit
will be transferred to settle the obligation and the amount of the obligation can be estimated
reliably.

Pensions

Contributions to defined contribution plans are expensed in the period to which they relate.
