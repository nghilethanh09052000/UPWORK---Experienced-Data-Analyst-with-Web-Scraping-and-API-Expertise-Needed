Foreword

We are proud to introduce York St John
University’s Annual Report and Financial
Statements for 2023-24. Within these pages,
you will find our reflections on a year of incredible
achievement, innovation and resilience.

During this year, our communities in
York and London have demonstrated
asteadfast commitment to supporting
a fairer, more prosperous society.
From our learning and teaching,
impactful research, knowledge
exchange and partner engagement,
we have sought to share our expertise
and ideas for the benefit of the people
and places we work with.

We drew last year to a close with an
exciting ambition to develop a new
strategy for York St John University.
Together with students, staff and
governors, we have used 2023-24
to create our shared vision forthe
future and launched our University
for Social Impact strategy in Autumn
2024, Founded on acommitment
to social impact, this new strategy
celebrates our heritage and looks
to the future as we strive to remain
acatalyst for a fairer future.

Now more than ever, the world

needs compassion, creativity, and the
capabilities to spark positive change.
At York St John, work continues to
ensure that we can deliver the skills
and attributes most needed by our
society, today and for the future.

This year we have seen the Institute
for Health and Care Improvement,
and the York St John Communities
Centre fully established, and we

have launched a Centre for Applied
Innovation. We have also consolidated
our postgraduate research community
support and formaily launched a
dedicated Postgraduate Research
School in Autumn 2024,

We have also opened new programmes
in paramedic science, healthcare
management, and cyber security and
are preparing to launch exciting
courses in augmented reality, midwifery,
operating department practice, and
diagnostic radiography in 2025.

Over the past twelve months we have
also strengthened our partnerships
with industry, civic stakeholders

and third sector organisations, to
foster collaborations that benefit

our communities and contribute to
addressing global challenges.

Through these partnerships we are also
championing employability, embedding
opportunities for our talented students
to connect with employers at all levels
of our undergraduate curriculum.

The University's commitment to
inclusivity and diversity remains at the
forefront of our work, We believe that

a diverse and inclusive environment
enriches the educational experience for
all and prepares our students to thrive
both within, and beyond, university.

This year, we have taken several positive
actions to support our work as a holder
of Athena Swan and Race Equality
Charter Bronze Awards. This includes
supporting more women through
leadership development, and the
introduction of new staff training aimed
at ensuring true equality of experience
for all students and staff from Black,
Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds.

Despite the recent and well publicised
financial challenges that are facing the
UK higher education sector, we remain
on apositive trajectory and continue to
be inspired by the incredible abilities
and dedication of our students, staff
and alumni, Together, we are creating
real change, right where it matters.

As we invite you to explore the rest of our
Annual Report and Financial Statements,
we would like to extend a final thank you

to all the members of our community,
made up of over 12,000 students
and over 1,000 staff, alongside many
external partners, for their continued
support. We are excited about the
opportunities that lie ahead for York
St John University and will continue
to build on our successes, addressing
new challenges with the same spirit
of innovation and determination that
has brought us to where we are today.

Strategic Delivery

We delivered on key aims of our outgoing
strategy ahead of schedule and therefore
this update focuses on our ongoing
commitment to student satisfaction and
teaching quality, research and innovation,
employability, partnerships, diversity and
equality, and environmental sustainability.

Over the course of 2023-24, staff from
across the Institution, supported by our
Board of Governors, have developed
anew strategy to strengthen York St
John's role as The University for Social
Impact. This was launched in Autumn
2024 alongside a report closing down
our previous strategy.

Over the next academic year, the
University will establish ten measurable
Indicators of Success, which will be
driven by refreshed teaching and
learning, research and financial
frameworks, and enabling plans

led by our Schools and Directorates.

STUDENT
SATISFACTION AND
TEACHING QUALITY

The University was awarded Gold for
student experience and Silver overall
in the 2023 Teaching Excellence
Framework (TEF), indicating that the
TEF panel found outstanding features
across both student experience and
student outcomes. These ratings are
published on Discover Uni and UCAS
as useful context to the range of
information for students to consider
when deciding what and where to study.

Student feedback placed York
StJohn in the top third of best
performing English universities for
overall positivity in the 2024 National
Student Survey. Feedback from our
final-year undergraduate students
showed that they feel listened to, are
positive about the academic support
they receive, and are happy with the
resources, teaching, assessment
and feedback on their course.

Our international students shared
feedback on their experience through
the International Student Barometer.
The results highlighted a series of
strengths for York St John, with overall
satisfaction sitting at 93%, 3% above
the UK sector average. Significantly,
we were above the UK benchmark for
all levels and modes of study across
our two campuses in York and London,
with particularly high scores for themes
including teaching, studies and facilities.

In the Postgraduate Research
Experience Survey (PRES), feedback
from our postgraduate research
students resulted in an overall
satisfaction score of 84%, 3% above
the sector average. The University also
ranked 5th for both satisfaction with the
quality of supervision and the research
skills programme. 92% of PGRs agreed
that their confidence to be creative had
developed, a figure that is 12 percentage
points above the Global benchmark.

In the Postgraduate Taught Experience
Survey (PTES), scores place us within the
top ten in the sector for Assessment and
Community. We also rank in the highest
quartile for Teaching, Engagement,
Organisation, Support and Skills
Development.

We are 78th in the Guardian University
Guide 2024 and rose 2 places to 77th
place in The Times and The Sunday
Times Good University Guide, where

we retained our 13th place for teaching
quality in the UK. In the WhatUni Student
Choice Awards 2024, we were ranked
amongst the top 10 universities in the
UK in the student-voted University of
the Year award,

In the first report by Ofsted into the
University’s degree apprenticeship
provision, the University was awarded
‘good’ for its quality of education,
behaviour and attitudes, personal
development of students and leadership
and management. The University also
won Mentor of the Year and Health

& Public Service Apprentice of the
Year awards at the North Yorkshire
Apprenticeship Awards 2024,

RESEARCH AND
INNOVATION

In November 2023, we opened

the Institute for Health and Care
improvement (IHCI) to address key
challenges facing health and social
care sectors. The Institute has just
launched a new pump-priming grant
scheme to support preliminary studies
and systematic reviews for external
grant applications for health and care
research. Quality-related (QR) funding -
from Research England will be invested
over the next academic year. IHCI
continues to forge close research

links with York and Scarborough
Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.

In 2024, we established the Centre

for Applied Innovation (CA\), a hub for
fostering innovation and advancing
technological and societal progress.
Located at our York campus, the Centre
acts as a catalyst for collaboration
between academic experts, industry
stakeholders, and the broader
community to meet some of society’s
most critical needs through pioneering
research. Services on offer include
research and development support,
prototype testing, regulatory guidance,
commercialisation support, and training
and education,

Also in 2023-24, the University has
enhanced its Postgraduate Research
{PGR} support and a new Postgraduate
Research School was launched

in Autumn 2024, The School will
provide a dedicated support service
for postgraduate research students
and their supervisors. With a growing
PGR community, the School provides a
comprehensive package of resources
and support, including a dedicated
research skills training programme,
scholarships and funding assistance.
Aseries of events and opportunities
will enable PGRs to come together to
share best practice.

For the second year, the institute for
Social Justice (ISJ) has funded research
partnerships with organisations in the
voluntary, charity and social enterprise
sector through its scheme of Community
Research Grants (CRGs). Projects include
a partnership with children's charity

The Island and research to understand
how older people engage with financial
benefits with Leeds Older Peopie's
Forum. Published research from the first
round of CRGs includes an evaluation of
rural health inequalities, ways to reduce
sexual harm in public spaces, and men's
mental health and suicide prevention.

In 2023-24, the ISU received external
funding from a diversity of sources
including Arts and Humanities Research
Council, British Academy, York and
North Yorkshire Combined Authority
and Sir Hailey Stewart Trust.

York St John University’s Enterprise
Centre is now into its third year of
supporting fledgling businesses

across the region. With 17 businesses

in residence, including 6 student led
enterprises, the Centre is helping to

drive local growth and innovation.

At our London campus, The Dock is
providing tailored assistance to small
teams and solo entrepreneurs in the city.
Alongside the offer of dedicated start-up
co-working space, The Dock delivers
resources and events that focus on
helping small businesses to develop the
skills, knowledge and networks they need
for future development. Businesses are
also able to access the campus’ Content
Creation Studio alongside complimentary
one to one professional coaching.

SUPPORTING
EMPLOYABILITY

The ongoing initiative to align

every course with work-related
‘experiential learning (WREL) puts
York St John at the forefront of
preparing students to be work-ready
graduates, The WREL framework
ensures students gain authentic
workplace skills and an understanding
of their own attributes, and is a key
component of enhancing graduate
outcomes. By 2028, all students on
all courses will have accessed
high-quality WREL opportunities.

The Kickstart Programme expanded its
offer to budding student entrepreneurs
to access a wide range of support,
funding and resources to develop
entrepreneurial ideas and turn them
into viable enterprises. In the past year,
support from the programme resulted
in several student start-ups, including

the launch of Kerry Holmes’ horror
and dark fantasy publishing business,
Dark Holmes Publishing.

York St John hosted a unique business
and entrepreneurship weekend for
cadets across Yorkshire aimed at
fostering entrepreneurial skills and
business acumen amongst young people.

In London, we connected students to
employers through initiatives including
our job fairs. Attended by over 1,000
students and 40 employers, each fair
supported students to explore a range
of employment opportunities including
part-time jobs, placements, internships
and volunteer positions with companies
including Arsenal Football Club, Aldi and
Enterprise Rent-A-Car.

Throughout 2023-24 our Vice
Chancellor continued to chair the

+ activity of Yorkshire Universities (YU),

the organisation that represents the
region's universities. Through our work
with YU, we collaborated with higher
education institutions and employers
across the region to champion
employability and help create more
opportunities for students to secure
graduate level jobs, Key work included
the creation of an inclusive recruitment
guide for employers, providing practical
guidance for widening the recruitment
of students and graduates.

POWER IN
PARTNERSHIPS

In October 2023, we formally opened
the York St John Communities Centre
to provide a new counselling and
mental health support venue in York.
This new public-facing service aims to
develop students’ experience and meet
the increasing need for mental health
support in the community, In addition

to providing high quality accessible and
affordable counselling, coaching and
different mental health and wellbeing
services within York and North Yorkshire,
the Centre hosts free support groups,
drop-ins, and community projects.

In 2024, we formed a landmark joint
working agreement between education
and health providers to enhance training
opportunities and develop the next
generation of innovative and highly
skilled healthcare professionals.
AMemorandum of Understanding
{MOU), between Tees, Esk and Wear
Valleys NHS Foundation Trust (TEWV)
and York St John University, will enable
the two organisations to develop the
next generation of innovative and highly
skilled healthcare professionals.

The University’s York Business

School partnered with award-winning
arts and culture organisation Aesthetica
to deliver a new business skills training
programme. The Creative Business
Skills Bootcamp offers start-ups a
progression route into the creative
industries, whilst supporting them to
develop and launch their business.

Colleagues from our York Business
School also supported the creation

of anew eight-year tourism strategy

for York following extensive consultation
with stakeholders from across the city
and the wider region. The new strategy
aims to foster positive change through
tourism and contribute to the city's
prosperity and wellbeing.

We hosted several major public
events on campus, including the

York Top 100 Businesses Awards,
the inaugural YSJ Community Festival
and the Institute for Social Justice
annual Doing Change event. Held in
the University’s Creative Centre, this
celebration of student research and
activism focused on driving positive
social change and brought together
students, academics, guest speakers
and members of the local community.

We continued to sponsor York
Literature Festival, the Aesthetica
Short Film Festival and the York
International Shakespeare Festival
as part of our ongoing commitment
to the arts and creative industries.

At our London Campus, we forged
partnerships with businesses,
collaborating closely with industry
professionals to enrich our student
offering. We hosted dynamic careers
fairs and high-profile events to enhance
employment prospects and build
valuable networks for our stakeholders.
Additionally, we integrated community-
beneficial projects into our curriculum,
empowering students to positively
impact the loca! area. We are also
active and influential members of
London business networks, including
the London Chambers of Commerce.

VALUING DIVERSITY
AND EMBEDDING
EQUALITY

We are extremely proud of our work to
make higher education more inclusive,
following a 37-place rise in The Times
and The Sunday Times Good University
Guide 2024 social inclusion index.

The University is 11th in the UK for
recruitment of white working-class
boys (8.2 per cent of the intake),
regarded as the most underrepresented
group in higher education, and about
one in five of our students come from
adeprived area (a top 20 proportion).

This work was reflected in the submission
of ournew Access and Participation

Plan in July 2024, a requirement of

the Office for Students to ensure fairer
access to higher education. The new

plan sets out how we aim to improve
equality of opportunity for students from
disadvantaged backgrounds to access,
succeed in, and progress from higher
education against six key objectives,

In addition to being the headline sponsor
of the Yorkshire Young Asian Achiever
Awards for the fourth year, York St John
partnered with the QED Foundation to
establish a new Young Asian Yorkshire
(YAY) award for year 10 pupils in

West Yorkshire. The award celebrates
the outstanding dedication of pupils
completing a YAY mentoring programme,
which aims to raise attainment in schools
and support the aspirations of South
Asian pupils in the region.

The University’s All About Respect
project secured Home Office funding
to tackle sexual harm and hate crime
among teenagers.

Product Design student Richard
Holmes was highlighted in a Universities
UK campaign to celebrate those who
were first in their families to attend
university and the University was a
headline sponsor of York Pride.

Progress on our Athena Swan and
Race Equality Charter action plans
continues as our institutional leads
steer our work to embed gender
and race equality actions within
our policies, practices, and culture.

We continued to listen to the feedback
of our staff through our 2024 staff
survey. A 71% response rate gave
results that were indicative of the

overall workforce. It showed that
colleagues at York St John are motivated
by meaningful work and deeply value the
respect and appreciation extended to
people of all cultures and backgrounds.
Trusting senior leaders to act in the best
interest of the University is crucial, and
engagementis also influenced by the
perception of fair compensation for
work, Further conversations are
providing opportunities to explore
strengths, leading to positive
development and change.

Following feedback from our staff
networks, we made enhancements
to expand the remit of our disability
leave provision to include leave

for colleagues who are supporting
dependants with disabilities,

ENVIRONMENTAL
SUSTAINABILITY

The University’s Estates team was
named the winner of the Times Higher
Education (THE) award for Outstanding
Estates Team for 2023. The team
impressed judges at the awards with
their commitment to excellence and
sustainability and were recognised for
aseries of projects to improve energy
efficiency and biodiversity.

The Living Lab initiative was

shortlisted for a second Green

Gown Award, which celebrates
sustainability initiatives from the UK
higher education sector. York St John’s
submission for ‘Feeding the Campus’
showcased an expansive and ambitious
project for students to research and
improve food systems on campus.

Our York campus gained Silver Food
for Life accreditation which recognises
the quality and sustainability of our
catering services as good for our climate,
nature and health. The certification
marks dedication from the Catering
team in achieving very high standards
and traceability of produce used.

We continue to subsidise cooked food
for staff and students to ensure that
nutritious meals are affordable for all.

The University secured a grant from
Natural England to help save threatened
species and has begun work on anew
wildlife pond. In partnership with the

St Nicks conservation charity, the
funding from the Species Recovery
Programme will help the University to
protect water voles, great crested newts
and the tansy beetle on University land
adjoining the River Foss.

Statement on
Corporate Governance
and Internal Control

14

The following statement is based on Office
for Students (OfS) guidelines and reflects the
University’s regard for the Higher Education
Code of Governance (‘the Code’) published
by the Committee of University Chairs.

The University formally adopted the
latest iteration of the Code (2020)

at the meeting of the Board of
Governors on 12 November 2020,
with detailed consideration of the
Code by the Governance and
Nominations Committee. We confirm
that the requirements of the Code
have been applied to the University’s
governance arrangements during the
2023-24 financial year.

York St John University is a higher
education institution with taught and
tesearch degree awarding powers,
acompany limited by guarantee

{with no share capital) and an exempt
charity. The University’s Articles set
out its object and powers as required
under the Education Reform Act 1988.

In accordance with the Articles of
Association of the Company, the Board
of Governors is responsible for the
administration and management of the
affairs of the University and is required
to present audited Financiat Statements
for each financial year. This also includes
ensuring the operation of an effective
system of internal control.

Governors make an annual declaration
to conduct themselves in accordance
with accepted standards of behaviour
in public life (the ‘Nolan Principles’),
which embrace selflessness, integrity,
objectivity, accountability, openness,

honesty and leadership. Governors
are required to maintain an entry in

a Register of Interests and further

to declare any interests in relation to
matters under discussion at meetings.

The Board of Governors has adopted

a Statement of Primary Responsibilities
addressing sector guidance, OfS and UK
Research and Innovation requirements
and the University's status as a company
limited by guarantee. This statement
reflects the Board of Governors’
understanding of its responsibilities

in relation to governance and internal
control. It is published on the University's
website and is reviewed annually by the
Board of Governors.

The powers and duties of the Board
of Governors, as defined in the
Articles, include responsibility for:

* The determination of the
educational character and
objectives of the University and
the supervision of its activities

* The effective and efficient use
of resources, the solvency of the
University and the safeguarding
ofits assets

* Approving annual estimates
of income and expenditure

« The assignment of duties and
rights to, and the appraisal of,
the Vice Chancellor

* The determination of the policy
for pay and general conditions
of employment of the staff

* The appointment of auditors

* Ensuring that there is an
effective framework overseen by
the Academic Board to manage the
quality of learning and teaching and
to maintain academic standards,

The Vice Chancellor has a general
responsibility to the Board of Governors
for the organisation, direction and
management of the institution. There is a
clear division of responsibility in that the
roles of the Vice Chancellor and the Chair
of the Board of Governors are separate.

Under the Terms and Conditions of
Funding and ongoing registration

with the OfS, the Vice Chancellor is the
Accountable Officer of the University,
In that capacity, the Vice Chancellor
(and the Chair of the Board of
Governors) can be summoned to
appear before the Public Accounts
Committee of the House of Commons,
This responsibility extends to assuring
the quality and accuracy of University
data provided to OfS, the Higher
Education Statistics Agency (now

part of the Joint Information Systems
Committee) and other public bodies.

The Vice Chancellor exercises
considerable influence upon the
development of the University
Strategy, the identification and
planning of new developments,
and shaping ofits ethos. The wider
Executive contributes to significant
aspects of the work, working in
close collaboration with the Board
of Governors, which has ultimate
responsibility for the University's
strategic direction, educational
character and use of resources.

In accordance with the Articles of
Association, a Secretary to the Board

of Governors (and the Company) has
been appointed. The role holder provides
independent advice on matters of
governance to all members of the

Board of Governors.

The Board of Governors, through
its Governance and Nominations
Committee, ensures an appropriate
balance of skills and experience
among its members. An externally

facilitated effectiveness review is
carried out periodically to assess
practice and identify opportunities
for further enhancement.

The most recent review concluded in
2022-23, and all recommendations
have been implemented. The Board's
constitution includes the Vice Chancellor,
the President of the Students’ Union
and an elected staff member. The
remaining 14 members are external

and independent to the University.
Board of Governors’ members were not
previously remunerated for their work.
However, the Chair of the Board of
Governors has been remunerated since
1 August 2020; the Chairs of the Audit
Committee and the Finance and Capital
Development Committee have been
remunerated since 1 August 2021; and
the Chair of the People Committee has
been remunerated since 1 August 2022.
No Governor or person connected with
a Governor received any benefit from
either bursaries or scholarships awarded
to our students.

The Board of Governors holds three
formal business meetings each year.

In addition, it holds at least two informal
meetings a year to provide opportunities
to consider and discuss matters of
strategic importance in greater depth.

The following standing committees of
the Board of Governors handle detailed
work within defined terms of reference:
* Audit
* Finance and Capital Development
* Foundation

Governance and Nominations
° People
« Remuneration (Vice Chancellor)
* Remuneration (Senior

Leadership Team).

The committees mainly comprise
independent and external members

of the Board of Governors, one of
whom is appointed as the Chair of each
committee. Co-opted members are.
appointed as necessary to supplement
the skills and expertise of governors.

An Academic Board provides regular
reports to the Board of Governors on
academic matters, ensuring that the
Board of Governors can discharge its

ENGAGEMENT
WITH SUPPLIERS
AND THE BUSINESS
COMMUNITY

In 2023-24, York St John University
continued to strengthen its strategic
procurement practices in order to
enhance operational efficiency and
support the student experience.
With annual expenditure exceeding

£45 million across UK and international
suppliers, our procurement strategy
remains focused on fostering transparent,
fair, and robust processes that place us

in line with public sector best practice.

Our in-house procurement team
managed our expenditure. In total,
71% of new spend was controlled
through competitive tenders,
renegotiations and the strategic use of
public sector framework agreements.
Over 30% of that spend was through
collaborative ventures with partners
including the NHS, other universities and
across the wider public sector, 24% of
all new University spend was with Small
and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs),
reinforcing our commitment to nurturing
smaller businesses within our supply
chain. Participation in regional projects
with the North Eastern Universities
Purchasing Consortium (NEUPC) this
year totalled £2.9 million. By leveraging
the consortium's resources, including
the ongoing use of a shared online
procurement platform, we streamlined
processes for suppliers and enhanced
transparency in tender processes.

In line with our commitment to educational
enhancement through procurement,
student internships were offered

with key suppliers, providing valuable
hands-on experience, Leveraging
supplier expertise, we supported student
employability initiatives and delivered
specialised lectures on procurement

and supply chain management topics to
business students, We ensured student
representation in our procurement
decision-making processes through
their involvement in working groups and
tender committees. We also made the
strategic decision to withdraw from our
reliance upon outsourced business travel
management, by expanding our internal
team and delivering this service to staff
and students directly. This has given the
University the opportunity to develop
commercial relationships with local
hoteliers and travel providers in the region.

York St John University remains
committed to cultivating strong
relationships with our supply

continued innovation and collaboration,
we are positioned to adapt and thrive

in a dynamic procurement landscape,
delivering value and excellence to our
University community and beyond.

ENVIRONMENTAL
SUMMARY

York St John remains committed to
minimising our environmental impact,
We carefully monitor our environmental
performance including our carbon
footprint, waste production and the
extent to which we promote biodiversity.

As shown in this year’s summary
infographic (Figure 2), the University

is making significant progress against
our 2005 baseline to: reduce gas and
electricity consumption by 70% before
2025; and reduce carbon emissions by
80% before 2030, We are also actively
investigating further opportunities to
increase the proportion of our energy
from carbon-free sources.

An analysis of where we source

our energy from (Figure 1) shows

that a third now comes direct from
carbon free sources. We successfully
achieved our 70% reduction of
emissions target for 2025 in the
2022-23 academic year, and further
improvements have been made during
2023-24, We are continuing work

to reduce our dependence on gas
across the estate, employing lower-
carbon technologies and building fabric
improvements in all new building and
refurbishment projects. The pace of
our student and staff number growth
places pressure on carbon emissions,
but we are pleased to be able to
report an improvement not only in our
emissions per person and in proportion
to the space we occupy, but also in
absolute terms (Figures 2, 3 and 4),

Despite our growth, the University is
continuing work to reduce all forms
of waste and has maintained a policy
of zero waste-to-landfill since 2016.
Figure 5 shows where our waste
goes and Figure 6 shows our waste
production trend.

Scope 3 emissions are those that
result from activities of an organisation,
but occur indirectly, outside its
operational boundaries. Such emissions
are typically the more challenging to
quantify and manage, as they involve
awide range of activities, such as
procurement of goods and services,
emissions from business travel,
commuting of staff and students,

and many other activities. We collect
and publicly report our emissions from
business travel (Figure 7). We are
pleased that these have remained

lower than pre-Covid levels but know
that more work is required in this area
to challenge business travel and
change travel behaviours.

We see carbon and waste reduction

as complimentary to our focus on
biodiversity. This year we have continued
to implement our biodiversity action

plan, including: working with Natural
England's Species Recovery Programme
to create anew wildlife pond habitat
adjacent to our Sports Park; continuing
to grow wildflower and invertebrate
habitats across York; creating a
student-led community garden; and
launching the Sustainability Snapshots
campaign to recognise and celebrate the
students and staff making meaningful
contributions to sustainability.

We were delighted when York St John
won the award for ‘Outstanding Estates
Team’ at the Times Higher Education
Awards for this work, reflecting
tremendous achievements and
excellent teamwork in recent years.
We have also been shortlisted for

a Green Gown Award for Student
Engagement for the work of our Living
Lab: Feeding the Campus. Finally,

we achieved a Food for Life Bronze
certified by the Soil Association for
the YSJ Kitchen on our York campus.

Responsibilities in Respect
of Strategic Delivery, the
Directors’ Report and the
Financial Statements

The Board of Governors has prepared the
financial report in accordance with the
requirements of the Office for Students’ Terms

Institutions and UK Research and Innovation’s

Terms and Conditions of Research England
Grant and applicable law and regulations.

Company law requires the directors,

to prepare financial statements for

each financial year. Under that law they
have elected to prepare the University
financial statements in accordance with
UK accounting standards and applicable
law (UK Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice), including FRS 102 The
Financial Reporting Standard applicable
in the UK and Republic of Ireland, The
terms and conditions of funding further
require the financial statements to be
prepared in accordance with the 2019
Statement of Recommended Practice

— Accounting for Further and Higher
Education, in accordance with the
requirements of the Accounts Direction
issued by the Office for Students,

Under company law the directors must
not approve the financial statements
unless they are satisfied that they give a
true and fair view of the state of affairs
of the University and of its income and
expenditure, gains and losses, and
changes in reserves for that period.

In preparing each of the University

financial statements, the directors

are required to:

* Select suitable accounting policies
and then apply them consistently

* Make judgements and estimates
that are reasonable and prudent

¢ State whether applicable UK

for keeping adequate accounting
records that are sufficient to show
and explain the parent University’s
transactions and disclose with
reasonable accuracy at any time

the financial position of the parent
University and enable them to ensure
that its financial statements comply
with the Companies Act 2006.

23

They are responsible for such internal
control as they determine is necessary
to enable the preparation of financial
statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or
error, and have general responsibility
for taking such steps as are reasonably
open to them to safeguard the assets
of the University and to prevent and
detect fraud and other irregularities.

The Board of Governors is also
responsible for ensuring that:

¢ Funds from whatever source
administered by the University
for specific purposes have been
properly applied to those purposes
and managed in accordance with
relevant legislation

* Funds provided by the Office for
Students and UK Research and
Innovation have been applied in
accordance with the terms and
conditions attached to them

* There are appropriate financial
and management controls in
place to safeguard public funds
and funds from other sources

* The University’s resources
and expenditure are managed
efficiently and effectively.

The Board of Governors is responsible
for the maintenance and integrity of
the corporate and financial information
included on the University's website,

SECTION 172
STATEMENT

York St John University is
incorporated as a private company
limited by guarantee, which has

been granted exempt charity status.
Further detail can be found within the
corporate governance section on p16.
The Board notes its requirement under
the Companies Act 2006, Section
172 to report on how its Governors
(Directors) have had due regard for
their duties under Section 172 to
promote the success of the company,
Notably that a director of a company
must act in the way he/she considers,
in good faith, would be most likely to
promote the success of the company
for the benefit of its members as a
whole and in doing so have regard
{amongst other matters) to:

a. the likely consequences of
any decision in the long term;

b. the interests of the company's
employees;

c. the need to foster the company’s
business relationships with
suppliers, customers and others;

d. the impact of the company’s
operations on the community
and the environment;

e. the desirability of the company
maintaining a reputation for high
standards of business conduct; and

-f. the need to act fairly, as between

members of the company.

Members of the Board gave due
regard to the matters set out in
section 172 (ato f) when discharging
their duties. The following are some of
the key decisions taken by either the
Board or its committees during the
year with consideration given to
students and stakeholders:

{n February 2024 and in response

to achallenging external environment,
the Board of Governors agreed the
disposal of Peppermill Court, passing
the financial risk of developing the
site to an accommodation provider
having exhausted all options for
construction by the University.

During 2023-24 the Board's
oversight included approval of the
Annual Budget (receiving reports

onin year financial performance),

the Capital Investment Plan, the
Five-Year Forecast, the submission

of the Annual Financial Return to the
Office for Students and appropriate
revisions to governing documents such
as the Scheme of Delegation. As part
of the planning for 2024-25, the Board
had oversight of the outcomes of the
Annual Planning Round,

As part of the commitment to

ethical investment, the Board
approved changes to the Treasury
Management policy enabling the
University to place significant
deposits with banks with outstanding
economic, social and environmental
credentials. The People Committee
received reports on the University’s
approach to Gender Pay Gap, Equal
pay and approved proposals in relation
to accommodation costs for students.

On behalf of the Board of Governors,

Professor Karen Bryan OBE.

Key Risks and
Risk Management

FINANCIAL
SUSTAINABILITY

Over the past year we have witnessed
continued uncertainty relating to policy
in the higher education sector. Most
prominent is the previous government’
revisions to its International Education
Strategy, restricting the right of
international postgraduate students

to only allow those on postgraduate
research programmes to bring
dependents from January 2024. In the
short-term, we sought new markets

and we were able to recruit close to

our postgraduate international student
target for February 2024, with income
from full-time international students up
by 63% to £32.5 million (2023: £20
million). The University has not seen the
major reductions experienced across
the rest of the sector for recruitment in
2024-25. The report of the Migration
Advisory Committee in May has restored
some confidence in the market, together
with less hostile rhetoric from the new
Government and more stringent student
immigration rules being implemented

in rival sectors such as Canada and
Australia, Although the outlook is more
positive, the risk profile in the market is
unclear beyond the current recruitment
cycles into 2025-26.

GRADUATE
EMPLOYABILITY

In September 2023, York St John
received an overall Silver award for
student outcomes as part of the
Teaching Excellence Framework

(TEF). The University’s latest Graduate
Outcomes Survey results were issued

in June 2024, capturing the outcomes
of 2021~22 graduates 15 months
after completing their studies. Whilst the
proportion of York St John graduates

in graduate level jobs remains above the
B3 Progression numerical threshold of
60%, we remain concerned in relation to
graduate employability and the variation

$s

in performance between subjects.
These are monitored annually through
the Portfolio Performance Review
process which assesses the risk of
programmes not meeting sector
thresholds for a number of aspects.
including graduate outcome. Work-~
related experiential learning (WREL)
continues to be critical in supporting
student career ideation, confidence
and planning by enabling students to
explore and develop confidence in

how the knowledge, skills and attributes
developed through their programme

of studies can be applied to the world
of work. Following a successful pilot
study, all subjects are now embedding
WREL at all levels from 2024-25 and
centralised support to embed WREL is
being prioritised. Due to the lag in GOS
surveying (15 months after graduation),
we may not see a full resultant change in
progression data, as aresult of WREL,
in the Graduate Outcomes Survey until
June 2028 and subsequently, in B3
until 2029,

STAFF ENGAGEMENT
AND PERFORMANCE

We expected that overall staff morale
and engagement would be negatively
affected by ongoing financial instability
across the sector, and by some of the
organisational changes that we have

had to make as a result. The University
achieved a set of moderate results

in the 2024 staff survey, which were
broadly consistent with 2023 outcomes.
Colleagues at York St John are motivated
by meaningful work and deeply value the
respect and appreciation extended to
people of all cultures and backgrounds,
Scores for the engagement elements.

of pride, advocacy and loyalty have
slightly decreased since last year.

These results will inform change plans
and amendments to the People and
Culture Action Plan, plus prioritisation

of activity on the Race Equality Action
Plan and Athena Swan Action Pian.

25

STUDENT
ACCOMMODATION

At the start of the 2023-24 academic
year, student accommodation provision
in York was considered a significant
operational risk for York St John, since
there is no credible citywide housing
strategy which seeks to account

for the required affordable student
housing provision. With demand
continuing to exceed supply, we have
seen costs to students increasing

above the rate of inflation and do
not expect this pressure to recede
in the short-medium term. Since
then, and in line with our plan to
operate a hybrid portfolio of owned,
long leased and nominations-based
accommodation, the University has.
secured sufficient student rooms
for the medium term. Importantly,
our student accommodation offer
continues to be amongst the best
value in the sector, and we continue
to guarantee all first year students a

room. We can also absorb an increase

in demand from returning students,

and can cater for commuting students
through subsided single night lettings. In
2024-25 the University will subsidise the
cost of accommodation by circa £1.2m,

In the longer term, and as a result of our
collaborative lobbying, evidence and
planning inspectorate submissions, we
hope that the implementation of policy
proposals in the York Local Plan, focussed
on affordability, will allow more purpose-
built accommodation to be developed.


Financial Review

The financial year was characterised by sound
operational performance in a challenging
environment, given the significant inflationary
pressures across all areas of activity with the

fee for the core home undergraduate students
remaining at £9,250 for the year — the fee has
been unchanged since 2016-17. The University
was able to increase its market share in relation
to the recruitment of international students

in an environment where the sector overall
experienced significant decline. The University
is able to report a surplus of £4.6 million

(2023: £3.4 million deficit) after accounting for
Office for Students capital grant of £2.3 million.
The University generated cash from operating
activities of £5.9 million, 5.4% of income (2023:
£10.9 million, 12.3% of income) with cash
reserves of £34.7 million (2023: £36 million).

INCOME

Total operating income increased by
25% to £110.3 million (2023: £88.6
million). Income from full-time home

and EU students was up by 10.7% to
£54.8 million (2023: £49.5 million)

with income from full-time international
students up by 63% to £32.5 million
(2023: £20 million). Income from Degree
Apprenticeship programmes decreased
by 5% to £2.2 million (2023: £2.3
million). The University received a total
capital grant from the Office for Students
{OFS) of £2.3 million (2023: £0.9 million)
which is required to be shown in the
Statement of Comprehensive Income
under FRS 102 guidelines.

The recruitment of international
students to both London and York °
underpins the University's financial
position in 2023~24 and over the short
to medium term. The University has
been able to maintain its market share
relative to the sector which has seen
major contraction during 2023-24.

FINANCIAL OUTLOOK

The University remains in a good
liquidity position in the short to medium
term and complied with its banking
covenants in 2023-24, The University's
financial strategy is to invest in facilities
and infrastructure for the benefit of our
students and the community in which we
live and work — financial performance

in 2023-24 has been sound ina
challenging environment. 2024-25

will see the final year of significant

levels of capital expenditure, supported
by OfS grant, before returning to levels
more closely linked to cash generated
from operating activities.

These continue to be financially
challenging times for UK Higher
Education, with more than 40% of
universities expected to post deficits
in 2023-24 and a significant number
currently in the process of major cost

academic year. The new Government,
working alongside the Regulator, is yet
to establish a clear vision for the sector.
Against this backdrop, the University

has progressed and implemented a
comprehensive savings package in

the first half of the calendar year in
preparation for 2024-25, and together
with strong performance against both
International and Home recruitment
targets, the University has been able

to set a budget which is prudent and
consistent with meeting the requirements
of its banking covenants. The University's
finances are underpinned by International
recruitment outcomes, primarily the
surplus generated by the London
Campus. This risk is embedded in the
University’s financial model and needs

to be managed and mitigated over the
period of the Five-Year Forecast.

CONCLUSIONS
RELATING TO
GOING CONCERN

In auditing the financial statements,

we have concluded that the board
members’ use of the going concern
basis of accounting in the preparation of
the financial statements is appropriate.

Based on the work we have

performed, we have not identified

any material uncertainties relating to
events or conditions that, individually

or collectively, may cast significant doubt
on the University’s ability to continue as
agoing concern for a period of at least
twelve months from when the financial
statements are authorised for issue.

Our responsibilities and the
responsibilities of the board
members with respect to going
concern are described in the
relevant sections of this report.

Our opinion on the financial statements
does not cover the other information
and, except to the extent otherwise
explicitly stated in our report, we do
not express any form of assurance
conclusion thereon.

Our responsibility is to read the

other information and, in doing so,
consider whether the other information
is materially inconsistent with the
financial statements or our knowledge

apparent material misstatements, we are
required to determine whether there is
amaterial misstatement in the financial
statements or a material misstatement
of the other information, If, based on the
work we have performed, we conclude
that there is a material misstatement of
this other information, we are required
to report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.

RESPONSIBILITIES
OF THE BOARD OF
GOVERNORS

As explained more fully in the Statement
of Directors’ responsibilities, the Board
of Governors (who are also the directors
of the University for the purposes of
company law) are responsible for the
preparation of the financial statements
and for being satisfied that they give a
true and fair view, and for such internal
control as the board members determine
is necessary to enable the preparation
of financial statements that are free
from material misstatement, whether
due to fraud or error,

In preparing the financial statements,
the Board of Governors are responsible
for assessing the University’s ability to
continue as a going concern, disclosing,
as applicable, matters related to going
concern and using the going concern
basis of accounting unless the board
members either intend to liquidate the
University or to cease operations, or
have no realistic alternative but to do so.

AUDITOR’S
RESPONSIBILITIES
FOR THE AUDIT OF
THE FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial
statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due
to fraud or error, and to issue an
auditor's report that includes our
opinion, Reasonable assurance is
ahigh level of assurance, but is not a
guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with ISAs (UK) will always
detect a material misstatement when
it exists. Misstatements can arise from
fraud or error and are considered
material if, individually or in the
aggregate, they could reasonably be
expected to influence the economic
decisions of users taken on the basis
of these financial statements.

34

Extent to which the audit
was capable of detecting
irregularities, including fraud

Irregularities, including fraud, are
instances of non-compliance with laws
and regulations. We design procedures
in line with our responsibilities, outlined
above, to detect materia! misstatements
in respect of irregularities, including
fraud, The extent to which our procedures
are capable of detecting irregularities,
including fraud is detailed below:

Non-compliance with
laws and regulations

Based on:

* Our understanding of the University
and the sector in which it operates;

* Discussion with management and
those charged with governance;

* Obtaining and understanding
of the University’s policies and
procedures regarding compliance
with laws and regulations.

We considered the significant laws and
regulations to be their registration with
the OfS, and we considered the extent

to which non-compliance might have a
material effect on the University Financial
Statements or their continued operation.

The University is also subject to laws

and regulations where the consequence
of non-compliance could have a material
effect on the amount or disclosures in the
financial statements, for example through
the imposition of fines or litigations. We
identified such laws and regulations to be
compliance with the Accounts Direction
OfS 2019.41 and tax legislation.

Our procedures in respect

of the above included:

* Review of minutes of meeting of
those charged with governance
for any instances of non-compliance
with laws and regulations;

* Review of correspondence with
regulatory and tax authorities for
any instances of non-compliance
with laws and regulations;

* Review of financial statement
disclosures and agreeing to
supporting documentation;

* Review of legal expenditure
accounts to understand the
nature of expenditure incurred.

32

Fraud , .

We assessed the susceptibility of

the financial statements to material
misstatement, including fraud. Our
risk assessment procedures included:

* Enquiry with management and those
charged with regarding any known
or suspected instances of fraud;

* Obtaining an understanding of
the University’s policies and
procedures relating to:

° Detecting and responding
to the risks of fraud; and

Internal controls established to
mitigate risks related to fraud.

* Review of minutes of meeting
of those charged with governance
for any known or suspected
instances of fraud;

* Discussion amongst the engagement
team as to how and where fraud might
occur in the financial statements;

* Performing analytical procedures to
identify any unusual or unexpected
relationships that may indicate risks
of material misstatement due to fraud,

Based on our risk assessment, we
considered the areas most susceptible
to fraud to be posting inappropriate
journal entries to manipulate financial
results and management bias in
accounting estimates.

Our procedures in respect *
of the above included:

* Testing a sample of journal entries
throughout the year, which met a
defined risk criteria, by agreeing
to supporting documentation;

* Assessing significant estimates
made by management for bias,
including challenging assumptions
made by management in their
significant accounting estimates
in relation to the defined benefit
pension liability, provision against
student and other debtors;

° Review of deferred income
calculations and credit balances
on the debtors ledger to ensure
that income has been recognised
appropriately;

« Reading minutes of meetings of
those charged with governance,
reviewing internal audit reports
and reviewing correspondence
with HMRC and the OfS.

We also communicated relevant identified
laws and regulations and potential fraud
risks to all engagement team members
and remained alert to any indications of
fraud or non-compliance with laws and
regulations throughout the audit.

Our audit procedures were

designed to respond to risks of

material misstatement in the financial
statements, recognising that the risk

of not detecting a material
misstatement due to fraud is higher
than the risk of not detecting one
resulting from error, as fraud may involve
deliberate concealment by, for example,
forgery, misrepresentations or through
collusion. There are inherent limitations
in the audit procedures performed and
the further removed non-compliance
with laws and regulations is from the
events and transactions reflected in

the financial statements, the less

likely we are to become aware of it.

A further description of our
responsibilities for the audit of the
financial statements is located on the
Financial Reporting Council's website at:
www .fre.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.
This description forms part of our
auditor's report.

USE OF OUR REPORT

This report is made solely to the board
members, as a body, in accordance with
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies
Act 2006, Our audit work has been
undertaken so that we might state to the
University's board those matters we are
required to state to them in an auditor's
report and for no other purpose. To the
fullest extent permitted by law, we do
not accept or assume responsibility to
anyone other than the University and the
board members as a body, for our audit
work, for this report, or for the opinions
we have formed.

FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS |

BASIS OF
PREPARATION

The University is a company limited
by guarantee. Under the terms of the
Articles of Association, the members
of the University Board of Governors
have each undertaken to contribute
amaximum of £1 in the event of
winding up of the company.

The University's financial statements
have been prepared in accordance with
United Kingdom Accounting Standards,
including Financial Reporting Standard
102 (FRS 102) and the Statement

of Recommended Practice (SORP):
Accounting for Further and Higher
Education (2019 edition). They have
also been prepared in accordance with
the ‘carried forward’ powers and duties
of previous legislation (Further and
Higher Education Act 1992 and the
Higher Education Act 2004) and the
new powers of the Higher Education
and Research Act 2017 during the
transition period to 31 July 2019,

the Accounts Direction issued by the
Office for Students (OfS), the Terms
and Conditions of funding for higher
education institutions issued by the
OfS and the Terms and Conditions

of Research England Grant.

The University is a public benefit
éntity and therefore has applied the
relevant public benefit requirement
of the applicable UK laws and
accounting standards.

The financial statements do not

include those of the Students’ Union as
itis a separate organisation in which the
University has no control or significant
influence over policy decisions.

FORMAT OF
THE ACCOUNTS

The Directors have taken advantage
of the Companies Act 2006 to adapt
the format of the accounts to reflect
the special nature of the Company's
business,

Statement of Principal
Accounting Policies

RECOGNITION
OF INCOME

Income from the sale of goods or
services is credited to the Statement
of Comprehensive Income when the
goods or services are supplied to the
external customers or the terms of
the contract have been satisfied.

Fee income is stated gross and
credited to the Statement of
Comprehensive Income over the period
inwhich students are studying, being
recognised according to the fee liability
points within the University’s Student
Financial Regulations. Where the amount
of tuition fee is reduced, by a discount,
income receivable is shown net of the
discount. Bursaries and scholarships
are accounted for gross as expenditure
and not deducted from income,

Government grants including

funding council block grant, research
grants from government sources,

and other grants and donations from
non-government sources (including
research grants from non-government
sources) are recognised in the Statement
of Comprehensive Income when the
University is entitled to the income and
performance-related conditions have
been met. Income received in advance
of performance-related conditions
being met is recognised as deferred
income within creditors on the balance
sheet and released to income as the
conditions are met. Where there are
no performance-related conditions
then income is recognised in the
period in which it is received,

Non-exchange transactions without
performance-related conditions are
donations and endowments.

Donations and endowments with donor-
imposed restrictions are recognised

in the Statement of Comprehensive
Income when the University is entitled
to the income. Income is retained within
the restricted reserve until it is utilised in
line with restrictions, when the income is
released to general reserves through a
reserve transfer.

Donations with no restrictions are
recorded within the Statement of
Comprehensive Income when the
University is entitled to the income.
Donations and endowments with
restrictions are classified as restricted
reserves with additional disclosure

provided within the notes to the accounts.

Endowment and investment income
is credited to income in the year in
which it arises and is recorded as
either restricted or unrestricted
income according to the terms

of the individual endowment fund.

There are four main types of donations
and endowments with restrictions:

1. Restricted donations — the donor
has specified that the donation must
be used for a particular objective

2. Unrestricted permanent endowments
— the donor has specified that the
fund is to be permanently invested
to generate an income stream for
the general benefit of the University

Restricted expendable endowments
— the donor has specified a particular
objective other than the purchase or
construction of tangible fixed assets
and the University can convert the
donated sum into income

»

4. Restricted permanent endowments
— the donor has specified that the
fund is to be permanently invested
to generate an income stream to be
applied to a particular objective.

CAPITAL GRANTS

Capital grants are recognised in income
when the University is entitled to the
funds, subject to any performance-
related conditions being met.

AGENCY
ARRANGEMENTS

Funds the University receives and
disburses as an agent are excluded
from the income and expenditure of
the University on the basis that the
University is exposed to minimal risk
or enjoys minimal economic benefit
related to the transaction.

PENSION SCHEMES

Retirement benefits for employees

of the University are provided by two
pension schemes: the Teachers’ Pension
Scheme (TPS) for academic staff and
the North Yorkshire Pension Fund
{NYPF) for non-academic staff. The two
schemes are externally funded and were
contracted out of the Additional State
Pension until the new State Pension
was introduced on 6 April 2016.

The TPS is a multi-employer defined
benefit scheme. Due to the mutual
nature of the scheme, the assets are
not attributed to individual institutions
and a scheme-wide contribution rate is
set. The University is therefore exposed
to actuarial risks associated with other
institutions’ employees and is unable
to identify its share of the underlying
assets and liabilities of the scheme on
aconsistent and reasonable basis.

As required by Section 28 of FRS

102 ‘Employee benefits’ the University
therefore accounts for the scheme as

if it were a wholly defined contribution
scheme. As a result, the amount charged
to the income statement represents

the contributions payable to the

scheme in respect of the accounting

period. Not less than every four years,
the Government Actuary, using normal
actuarial principles, conducts a

formal actuarial review of the TPS.

The NYPF is a multi-employer defined
benefit pension scheme administered by
North Yorkshire County Council as part of
the Local Government Pension Scheme.
The NYPF is valued every three years by
a professionally qualified independent
actuary and the University’s share of

the fund’s assets and liabilities are
identified. The assets of the NYPF are
measured using closing market values.
NYPF liabilities are measured using the
projected unit method and discounted
at the redemption yield on the iBoxx
Sterling AA corporate bond index over

a duration equivalent to the liabilities.
The increase in the present value of the
liabilities of the scheme expected to arise
from employee service in the period is
charged to the operating surplus. The
expected return on the scheme’s assets
and the increase during the period in the
present value of the scheme's liabilities,
arising from the passage of time, are
included in pension finance costs.

The amounts charged to operating
surplus are the current service costs
and the costs of scheme introductions,
benefit changes, settlements and
curtailments. They are included as
part of staff costs as incurred.

Net interest on the net defined benefit
liability/asset is also recognised in the
Statement of Comprehensive Income
and comprises the interest cost on

the defined benefit obligation and
interest income on the scheme assets,
calculated by multiplying the fair value
of the scheme assets at the beginning
of the period by the rate used to discount
the benefit obligations. The difference
between the interest income on the
scheme assets and the actual return
onthe scheme assets is recognised

in interest and other finance costs.

Actuarial gains and tosses are
recognised immediately in actuarial gain/
(loss) in respect of pension schemes.

ENHANCED PENSIONS

The actual cost of certain enhanced
ongoing pensions to former members
of staffis being paid by the University
annually. An estimate of the change

in expected future cost of these
enhancements was charged in full to
the income and expenditure account
in the past. The provision for these
costs is adjusted annually.

35

EMPLOYMENT
BENEFITS

Short-term employment benefits such
as salaries and compensated absences
are recognised as an expense in the year
in which the employees render service to
the University. Any unused benefits are
accrued and measured as the additional
amount the University expects to pay as
a result of the unused entitlement.

OPERATING LEASES

Costs in respect of operating leases
that are structured to increase by
fixed amounts are recognised ona
straight-line basis over the lease term.

FOREIGN CURRENCY
TRANSLATIONS

Transactions in foreign currencies are
translated to the functional currency
(pounds sterling) at the foreign exchange
rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies at the
balance sheet date are translated to the
functional currency (pounds sterling) at
the rates of exchange ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on
translation are recognised in Surplus or
Deficit in the period in which they arise.

TANGIBLE
FIXED ASSETS

Tangible fixed assets are stated

at cost (or deemed cost} less
accumulated depreciation and
accumulated impairment losses.

Where parts of a fixed asset have
different useful lives, they are accounted
for as separate items of fixed assets.

Land and buildings that had been
revalued to fair value on 1 August
2014 —the date of transition to the
2015 SORP — are measured based
on deemed cost, being the revalued
amount at the date of that revaluation.
Freehold land is not depreciated as
itis considered to have an indefinite
useful life. Freehold buildings are
depreciated ona straight-line basis
over their expected useful lives as
advised by the external valuer,

which vary between 10 and 90

years. Costs incurred in relation to
land and buildings after initial purchase
or construction are capitalised to the
extent that they increase the expected
future benefits to the University.

Additions to leasehold buildings are
depreciated on a straight-line basis
over the remaining life of the lease.

Impairment: a review for impairment
of a fixed asset is carried out if events
or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying value of the fixed
asset may not be recoverable.

Buildings under construction are
accounted for at cost, based on the
value of architect’s certificates and
other direct costs incurred prior to
year-end. They are not depreciated
until brought into use.

Motor vehicles, fixtures and fittings,
computers and other equipment:
assets costing £5,000 or more are
assessed for capitalisation, Purchases
under this value are written off to the
Statement of Comprehensive Income
in the year of acquisition.

Capitalised items are stated at cost
and depreciated straight-line over
their expected useful lives as follows:
* Equipment (including

motor vehicles) — 5 years
* Fixtures and fittings - 10 years
¢ Computer hardware - 4 years
© Computer infrastructure — 5 years

Expenditure to ensure that a tangible
fixed asset maintains its previously
recognised standard of performance
is recognised in the Statement of
Comprehensive Income in the period
itis incurred. The University has a
planned maintenance programme,
which is reviewed on an annual basis,
Depreciation methods, useful lives and
residual values are reviewed at the date
of preparation of each Balance Sheet.

Borrowing costs which are directly
attributable to the construction of
land and buildings are not capitalised
as part of those assets but recognised
as an expense in the Statement of
Comprehensive Income in the period
in which they are incurred.

INTANGIBLE
FIXED ASSETS

Software: initial costs of acquiring
rights to software and the costs of
developing corporate information
systems, including consultancy services
and essential staff recruited specifically
for that purpose, are capitalised and
amortised on a straight-line basis over
the expected useful life of the systems,
being determined by contractual rights
of use or other reasonable estimate.
Assets under development are not
amortised until brought in use.

Accounting for research and
development: expenditure on pure and
applied research is treated as a part of
the continuing activities of the University.
Expenditure on development activities is
carried forward and amortised over the
period during which economic benefit

is expected to be received.

Website development costs: design
and content costs relating to the
development of websites to support
specific teaching or training courses,
or for specific research projects, are
capitalised. These are amortised over
the useful economic life of projects.

Where there is uncertainty over the
life of the course or its viability such
costs are written off as incurred,

as are design and content costs for
websites that are for the general
use of the University and its staff.

STOCK

Stock is stated at the lower of cost

or net realisable value. Stock held in
academic departments is written off to
the Statement of Comprehensive Income
in the year of purchase, Where necessary,
aprovision is made for obsolete, slow
moving or defective stock.

CASH AND CASH
EQUIVALENTS

Cash includes cash in hand, deposits
repayable on demand and overdrafts.
Deposits are repayable on demand if
they are available within 24 hours without
penalty. Cash equivalents are short-term
(maturity being less than three months
from the placement date), highly liquid
investments that are readily convertible to
known amounts of cash with insignificant
risk of change in value. These include term
deposits held as part of the University's
treasury management activities.

Bank deposits that do not meet the
definition of cash equivalent, being
funds set aside for longer than three
months for the purpose of earning
interest, are shown separately as
current asset investments.

PROVISIONS

Provisions are recognised when

the University has a present legal or
constructive obligation as a result of a
past event, it is probable that a transfer of
economic benefit will be required to settle
the obligation, and a reliable estimate can
be made of the amount of the obligation.

The amount recognised as a provision is
determined by discounting the expected
future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that
reflects risks specific to the liability.

CONTINGENT ASSETS
AND LIABILITIES

Contingent assets and liabilities are
not recognised in the Balance Sheet
but are disclosed in the notes.

Acontingent liability arises from a

past event that gives the University a
probable obligation whose existence will
only be confirmed by the occurrence or
otherwise of uncertain future events not
wholly within the control of the University.

Contingent liabitities also arise in
circumstances where a provision would
otherwise be made but either it is not
probable that an outflow of resources
will be required or the amount of the
obligation cannot be measured reliably,

Acontingent asset arises where an event
has taken place that gives the University
a possible asset whose existence will
only be confirmed by the occurrence or
otherwise of uncertain future events not
wholly within the control of the University.

TAXATION

The University is an exempt charity
within the meaning of Part 3 of the
Charities Act 201 1, Itis therefore a
charity within the meaning of paragraph
1 of Schedule 6 to the Finance Act
2010, Accordingly, the University is
potentially exempt from taxation in
respect of income or capital gains
received within categories covered by
sections 478-488 of the Corporation
Tax Act 2010 (CTA 2010) or Section
256 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains
Act 1992 to the extent that such income
or gains are applied to exclusively
charitable purposes.

The University receives no similar
exemption in respect of Value Added
Tax. Irrecoverable VAT on inputs is
included in the costs of such inputs. Any
irrecoverable VAT allocated to tangible
fixed assets is included in their cost.

FINANCIAL
INSTRUMENTS

The University has elected to

adopt Sections 11 and 12 of FRS
102 in respect of the recognition

and measurement, and disclosure of
financial instruments. Financial assets

and liabilities are recognised when

the University becomes party to the
contractual provision of the instrument
and they are classified according

to the substance of the contractual
arrangements entered into.

The basic financial instruments held by
the University include cash and bank
deposits, loans, receivables from trade
debtors and payables to trade creditors.

Basic financial assets and liabilities are
initially measured at transaction price
{including transaction costs), unless
the arrangement constitutes a
financing transaction. If an arrangement
constitutes a financing transaction,

the financial asset or financial liability

is measured at the present value of

the future payments discounted at
amarket rate of interest for a similar
debt instrument. Under FRS 102 basic
financial instruments will subsequently
be carried at amortised cost using the
effective interest rate method; however
the University may in practice hold
them at cost where there would be no
material difference between that and
amortised cost.

Complex financial instruments held
include derivatives used to reduce
exposure to interest rate movements
on bank loans. The University does
not hold or issue derivative financial
instruments for speculative purposes.
The University has entered into an
interest rate swap agreement which
has not been designated a financial
hedge under Section 12 of FRS 102.
As such, the instrument was initially
recognised at fair value at the date
the derivative contract was entered
into and is subsequently remeasured
to its fair value at each reporting date.
The resulting gain or loss is recognised
in surplus or deficit,

Afinancial asset anda financial
liability are offset only when there is
alegally enforceable right to set off
the recognised amounts and an
intention either to settle on anet
basis, or to realise the asset and
settle the liability simultaneously.

Assets, other than those measured at
fair value, are assessed for indicators
of impairment at each balance sheet
date. If there is objective evidence

of impairment, an impairment loss

is recognised in the Statement of
Comprehensive Income.

37

Financial assets are derecognised
when the contractual rights to the
cash flows from the asset expire or
are settled or substantially all of the
risks and rewards of the ownership
of the asset are transferred to
another party, Financial liabilities are
derecognised when the liability is
discharged, cancelled or expires.

RESERVES

Reserves are allocated between
restricted and unrestricted reserves.
Restricted endowment reserves include
balances which, through endowment to
the University, are held as a permanently
restricted fund as the University must
hold the fund to perpetuity.

Other restricted reserves include
balances through which the donor
has designated a specific purpose
and therefore the University is
restricted in the use of these funds.

JUDGMENTS

IN APPLYING
ACCOUNTING
POLICIES AND
KEY SOURCES
OF ESTIMATION
UNCERTAINTY

In preparing these financial
statements, management have
made the following judgments:

* Determine whether leases the
University enters into, either as a
lessor or lessee, are operating or
finance leases. These decisions
depend on an assessment of
whether the risks and rewards of
ownership have been transferred
from the lessor to the lessee ona
lease by lease basis.

¢ Determine whether there are
indicators of impairment of the
University’s tangible assets.
Factors taken into consideration
in reaching such a decision include
the economic viability and expected
future financial performance of the
asset and where it is a component
of alarger cash-generating unit,
the viability and expected future
performance of that unit.

* Determine the Provision for
Bad Debts given the increase
in student debt as a direct resutt
of the pandemic.

38

OTHER KEY SOURCES
OF ESTIMATION
UNCERTAINTY

Fixed assets

Tangible and intangible fixed assets
are depreciated over their useful lives
taking account of residual values,
where appropriate. The actual lives
of the assets and residual values

are assessed annually and may

vary depending on several factors.

In re-assessing asset lives, factors

such as technological innovation

and maintenance programmes are
considered. Residual value assessments
consider issues such as future market
conditions, the remaining life of the
asset and projected disposal values,

North Yorkshire Pension Fund

The present value of the North
Yorkshire Pension Fund defined benefit
liability depends on several factors that
are determined on an actuarial basis
using a variety of assumptions.

Two recent legal developments affecting
public sector pensions have been
considered by the scheme actuary who
has estimated their impact when valuing
the pensions liability at 31 July 2024.
These are the ‘McCloud judgment’
which relates to transitional protection
arrangements and age discrimination,
and the ‘Guaranteed Minimum Pension
indexation and equalisation’ which
relates to pension increases for
individuals reaching state pension age.

The assumptions used in determining
the net cost (income) for pensions
include the discount rate. Other sources
of estimation uncertainty include risks
associated with asset volatility, changes
in bond yield, inflation risk, changes

in life expectancy and the risk of

other employers exiting the Fund.

Any changes in these assumptions,
which are disclosed in Note 28, will
impact the carrying amount of the
pension liability. Furthermore, a roll
forward approach which projects results
from the latest full actuarial valuation
performed at 31 March 2022 has

been used by the actuary in valuing the
pensions liability at 31 July 2024. Any
differences between the figures derived
from the roll forward approach and a full
actuarial valuation would impact on the
carrying amount of the pension liability,

In 2023-24 the University
successfully challenged the initial
FRS 102 Accounting Results
Schedule provided by the NYPF
actuary on the basis ofthe salary ~
increases and mortality tables,

Under FRS 102,10.18 the University
is disclosing the impact of the revised
assumptions adopted in the financial
statements as it constitutes a change
in accounting estimates.

Going concern

The University’s activities, together

with the factors likely to affect its

future development and performance,
are set out in the Strategic Report.

The University’s cash flow, liquidity and
borrowings are presented in the financial
statements and accompanying notes.

The University's forecasts and financial
projections indicate that it will be able
to operate within its bank loan facilities
and comply with all relevant covenants
for the foreseeable future.

The University has prepared detailed
cash flow forecasts £34.2 million cash
at bank on 30 November 2025 fora
period of 12 months from the date of
approval of these financial statements.
After reviewing these forecasts the
Board of Governors is of the opinion
that, taking account of severe but
plausible downsides, the University wilt
have sufficient funds to meet its liabilities
as they fall due over the period of 12
months from the date of approval of the
financial statements (the going concern
assessment period). The budget has
been prepared on prudent assumptions
with a comprehensive financial risk
assessment (in year financial risk
2024-25 £2.82 million, 2023-24
£3.1 million) taking into account the
potential downside and an agreed
mitigation plan enabling the University
to respond and remain within its banking
covenants, should the worst-case
scenario materialise.

Consequently, the Board of Governors
is confident that the University will have
sufficient funds to continue to meet their
liabilities as they fall due for at least 12
months from the date of approval of the
financial statements and therefore have
prepared the financial statements on an
ongoing basis.

The Remuneration Committee (Vice Chancellor) is responsible for determining the remuneration, conditions of service

and any severance arrangements for the University's Vice Chancellor. The Vice Chancellor does not sit on this Committee.

In determining the remuneration of the Vice Chancellor, consideration is given to established independent sources of the
benchmark reward data for roles in comparable organisations. The Committee's approach to setting remuneration is with
reference to market rates, benchmark information and the national pay award; and the factors used in considering reward
proposals related to individual performance objectives in support of the University’s strategic priorities. The University's
Scheme for the Determination of Salary Increases and Performance Bonuses clearly establishes that decisions made will be
subject to affordability each year and a limit is placed on the total value of non-consolidated bonuses.

One of the factors considered by the Remuneration Committee (Vice Chancellor) is the pay multiple of the Vice Chancellor's
earnings against the median and mean of all staff. The Universities and Colleges Employers Association (UCEA) publishes
sector-level pay multiples using institutional-level data, collated by HESA. For 2022-23 the median basic pay ratio across
English HEIs was 6.9 and the median total remuneration ratio was 7.3.

No bonus was awarded to Professor Karen Bryan, Vice Chancellor in 2023-24 (£5k in 2022-23), In 2023-24 Professor

Bryan's basic pay was 6.24 times the median basic pay of staff (2022-23: 5.86 times), calculated on a full-time equivalent
basis. Professor Bryan's total remuneration was 6.94 times (2022-23: 6.13 times) the median total remuneration of staff,

calculated on a full-time equivalent basis. Professor Bryan was previously in receipt of payments in lieu of pension contributions

but during 2023-24 has rejoined the pension scheme.

The University does not operate full hedge accounting, however it has purchased an interest rate swap to hedge exposure

from variable interest rates, The fair value of the asset, held at fair value through profit and loss at the balance sheet date, was
determined using a quoted mid-market price obtained from the investment bank through whom the trade was arranged. The
notional value of the interest rate swap at 31 July 2024 was £443k (2023: £885k),

Retirement benefits for employees of the University are provided by defined benefit schemes which are funded by contributions
from the University and employees. Payments are made to the Teachers’ Pension Scheme (TPS) for academic staff and the North
Yorkshire Pension Fund for non-academic staff. These are independently administered schemes.

The contribution of the University as a percentage of pensionable salaries in 2023-24 was:

for academic staff, 23.68% up to 31 March 2024 and 28.68% from 1 April 2024 (including 0.08% administration charge);

for non-academic staff, 15.50%,

* Due to the mutual nature of the scheme it is not possible to identify each institution’s share of the underlying liabilities and assets
of the Teachers’ Pension Scheme. Under FRS 102(28) contributions to the scheme are to be accounted for as if it was a defined
contribution scheme. As a result the amount charged to the Income & Expenditure Account represents the contributions payable
to the scheme in respect of the accounting period.

North Yorkshire Pension Fund: non-academic staff
i) The 2022 valuation

The North Yorkshire Pension Fund is valued every three years by a professionally qualified independent actuary, the rates
of contribution payable being determined by the actuary. The 2022 valuation was based on the following assumptions:

Perannum Per annum

2022 2019

Rate of salary increase 3.55% 3.35%
Rate of increase of present value and future pensions 2.30% 2.10%

The actuarial valuation showed the market value of the scheme’s assets at 31 March 2022 was £4,634.5 million (2019: £3,575,2
million) and that the actuarial value of these assets represented 116% (2019: 114%) of the past service benefits that has accrued
to members after allowing for expected increases in earnings.

ii) FRS 102 valuation as at 31 July 2024

Under the definitions set out in FRS 102, the North Yorkshire Pension Fund is a multi-employer defined benefit pension scheme,
administered by North Yorkshire County Council. The actuary of the scheme has identified the University’s share of the fund's
assets and liabilities for non-academic staff as at 31 July 2024.

Itis based upon a full actuarial valuation of the Fund at 31 March 2022 updated to 31 July 2024 by an independent actuary.

The end of year figures for the market value of the assets and split of assets between investment categories have been calculated
as at 31 July 2024.

The pension scheme assets are held in a separate Trustee-administered fund to meet long-term pension liabilities to past and
present employees. The trustees of the fund are required to act in the best interests of the fund's beneficiaries. The appointment
of trustees to the fund is determined by the scheme's trust documentation. The trustees are responsible for setting the investment
strategy for the Scheme after consultation with professional advisers.

* According to FRS102 a defined benefit pension asset should only be recognised to the extent that it is recoverable through
reduced employer contributions or a refund from the plan. Forecast contributions are higher than the projected current service

cost for scheme members, therefore the asset has been restricted to nil.

The University is a member of the Teachers’ Pension Scheme England and Wales (TPS) for academic and related staff.
The Teachers’ Pension Scheme (TPS) is a statutory, contributory, defined benefit scheme, governed by the

Teachers’ Pension Scheme Regulations 2014, These regulations apply to teachers in schools and other educational

establishments, including colleges. Membership is automatic for teachers and lecturers at eligible institutions. Teachers

and lecturers are able to opt out of the TPS.

The TPS is an unfunded scheme to which both the member and employer makes contributions, as a percentage of salary

— these contributions are credited to the Exchequer. Retirement and other pension benefits are paid by public funds

provided by Parliament.

Valuation of the Teachers’ Pension Scheme

The Government Actuary, using normal actuarial principles, conducts a formal actuarial review of the TPS in accordance
with the Public Service Pensions (Valuations and Employer Cost Cap} Directions 2014 published by HM Treasury every
four years, The aim of the review is to specify the level of future contributions. Actuarial scheme valuations are dependent

on assumptions about the value of future costs, design of benefits and many other factors.

The latest actuarial valuation of the TPS was carried out as at 31 March 2020. The valuation report was published by the
Department for Education on 26 October 2023. The key elements of the valuation and subsequent consultation are:

* employer contribution rates set at 28.68% of pensionable pay (including an administration levy of 0.08%); increasing
from 23.68%

* — total scheme liabilities (pensions currently in payment and the estimated cost of future benefits) for service to the
effective date of £262,000 million and notional assets (estimated future contributions together with the notional
investments held at the valuation date) of £222,200 million, giving a notional past service deficit of £39,800 million.

The 2020 valuation result was implemented from 1 April 2024. A copy of the valuation report and supporting

documentation is on the Teachers’ Pensions website.

The employer's pension costs paid to TPS in the year to 31 July 2024 amounted to £5,429,000 (2022-23: £4,310,000).

Under the definitions set out in FRS 102 (28,11), the TPS is an unfunded multi-employer pension plan. The University
is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the plan. Accordingly, the University has taken
advantage of the exemption in FRS 102 and has accounted for its contributions to the scheme as if it were a defined-
contribution plan. The University has set out above the information available on the scheme. .
Contributions amounting to £705,000 were payable to the scheme at 31 July 2024 (31 July 2023: £523,000) and are
included within creditors,

30 Related party transactions
During the year the University entered into transactions, in the ordinary course of business, with other related parties.
The Governors are the trustees for charitable law purposes. Due to the nature of the University's operations and the
composition of the Board of Governors (being drawn from local public and private sector organisations) and Senior
Leadership Team itis inevitable that transactions will take place with organisations in which a member of the Board
of Governors or Senior Leadership Team may have an interest. All transactions involving organisations in which a
member of the Board of Governors or Senior Leadership Team may have an interest are conducted at arm’s length
and in accordance with the University’s financial regulations and normal procurement procedures.

Relevant transactions which have been identified as requiring disclosure are as follows:
