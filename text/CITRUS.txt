per year. Providing critical services to the some of the UK's largest organisations across a range of sectors

Specialising in Education & Training, Management & Leadership, Accounting & Finance, BBE Training provide a
range of nationally recognised, accredited qualifications via distance learning, blended learning, and classroom
methods.
BUSINESS REVIEW The Group continues a strategic focus on strong sectors and has again illustrated resilience
against an otherwise challenging macroeconomic backdrop. Turnover grew to record levels in 21-22, with a further
increase in 22-23. The group has maintained its high turnover level in 23-24, whilst simultaneously investing in its
digital technology and development of its people.
FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE & KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS Financial and Non-Financial Key
Performance Indicators (KPI's) are included in all individual company reports and Group key performance
indicators are also included in Group board reports, along with comparisons of Turnover, Cost of Sales, and
individual Overheads to budget and prior year. Particular details of these can be found on page 11 of these
financial statements. Salaries, and staff related costs remain a significant overhead to the business, and key to
delivering outstanding customer performance. Head count increased during this financial year 23-24. Headcount of
153 (22-23 headcount 152) with FTE% 125.5 (22-23 FTE% 116.4). Citrus Training is the UK's leading provider of
health, safety, technical training, and qualification services for the Built Environment and Utility sectors. Our
customer-centric approach, underpinned by our core values ensures we continually set the standards in training
experience We have focussed this year on our highly valued Trainer and Feedback forms, helping us to implement
changes to enable us to fine tune our customer service to the highest standard of excellence. We believe that
customer service is key to our success, and investment to be included in our digital transformation, is the digital
integration of feedback forms so that these can be completed quickly and easily by the recipient and investigating a
wide variety of digital means for submission.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES The Board are confident that the Group has
available financing facilities which are sufficient to meet its working capital requirements. The majority of Group
sales and purchases are in sterling, so there is minimal exposure to currency risk. The Board are satisfied that
credit risk is adequately managed, and the debt position is monitored and reviewed by directors regularly. As a
result, bad debt experience is minimal.

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES The management of the business and the execution of the Group's
strategy are subject to normal risks. The key business risks and uncertainties have been assessed considering
their potential impact and the likelihood of occurrence, are considered as follows: Market, competition, and
emerging technologies The Group continues to monitor and profile the key sectors it serves and its resilience
against some challenging market environments. The Group continues to focus on service quality and delivery as
priorities in making our services attractive across our portfolio of business. We will drive a faster move to digital and
services evolution, enhancing the customer journey and maximising development opportunities. Talent Success in
attracting, retaining, and developing staff, is critical. Focus on staff health and wellbeing, embracing EDI, and
improving staff benefits are all continuing initiatives. Financial risk The Group's activities expose it to some financial
risk including credit risk, cash flow risk and liquidity risk. The Group's principal financial assets are bank balances
and trade debtors. The Group's credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade debtors. The amounts presented in
the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful debtors. An allowance for impairment is made where there is
an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the
cash flows. The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings
assigned by international credit-rating agencies. The Group has some concentration of credit risk with larger
contracted customers, but the majority of exposure is spread over a large number of customers. Data privacy and
cyber security The Group continues to strengthen its IT project management capability during the year to further
enhance its IT security processes and procedures, and specialist support. This investment is ongoing with
significant transformation planned during 24-26. The Group can demonstrate full data privacy and cyber security
policies fully meeting its statutory and specific client requirements. The Group's Data Protection Officer continues to
monitor compliance in this area. Safeguarding The Group continues to recognise the importance of managing risks
associated with Safeguarding & Protection. During inspection Ofsted confirmed the arrangements as effective.

FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK The Group's business activities, together with the factors likely to
affect its future development, performance, and position, are set out in this report. The financial position of the
Group and its liquidity position are set out in the attached accounts. The Board remain committed to accelerating
sustainable growth, continually delivering high level customer experience. The Board's commitment to developing
its people remains constant. 2024/25 will also see significant investment into its digital infrastructure, embracing
technology to deliver efficiencies across the Group and enhanced customer experience to its customers. The
Group continue to invest in its facilities and equipment at all locations. Major development plans are in place for
Northern geographical locations. The Board will continue to monitor the marketplace as part of their acquisition
strategy. Despite continued economic uncertainties the Board are confident that continued investment in our
people, together with our exciting planned digital transformation will deliver further growth in forthcoming years.

DIVIDENDS
Particulars of recommended dividends are detailed in note 12 to the financial statements.
QUALIFYING INDEMNITY PROVISION
The Company has maintained Trustees/Directors & Officers Liability Insurance throughout the year for the benefit
of the Directors. This qualifying third party indemnity provision, as defined by Section 234 of the Companies Act
2006, was in force during the financial year and remains in force at the date of this report. The insurance covers the
Directors against liabilities arising from their position as Directors, excluding any liability resulting wrongful
employment practice.
DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION IN THE STRATEGIC REPORT
The directors have chosen, in accordance with section 414C(11) of the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and
Directors' Report) Regulations 2013, to set out in the company's strategic report information required by schedule 7
of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008.
DIRECTORS' RESPONSIBILITIES STATEMENT
The directors are responsible for preparing the strategic report, directors’ report and the financial statements in
accordance with applicable law and regulations. Company law requires the directors to prepare financial
statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors have elected to prepare the financial statements in
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards
and applicable law). Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and the profit or loss of the
company for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to: - select suitable
accounting policies and then apply them consistently; - make judgments and accounting estimates that are
reasonable and prudent; - prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to
presume that the company will continue in business. The directors are responsible for keeping adequate
accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the company's transactions and disclose with reasonable
accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements
comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. AUDITOR

Each of the persons who is a director at the date of approval of this report confirms that:

- So far as they are aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the company's auditor is unaware; and -
they have taken all steps that they ought to have taken as a director to make themselves aware of any relevant
audit information and to establish that the company's auditor is aware of that information.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF CITRUS TRAINING LIMITED
YEAR ENDED 31 MAY 2024
OPINION
We have audited the financial statements of Citrus Training Limited (the ‘company') for the year ended 31 May
2024 which comprise the statement of comprehensive income, statement of financial position, statement of
changes in equity and the related notes, including a summary of significant accounting policies. The financial
reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting
Standards, including FRS 102 The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). In our opinion the financial statements: - give a true
and fair view of the state of the company's affairs as at 31 May 2024 and of its loss for the year then ended; - have
been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; - have been
prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
BASIS FOR OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable
law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the auditor's responsibilities for the audit of
the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the company in accordance with the ethical
requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical
Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe
that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
CONCLUSIONS RELATING TO GOING CONCERN
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of
accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.
Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or
conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a
going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.
Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the
relevant sections of this report.

OTHER INFORMATION

The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements
and our auditor's report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the
financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our
report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the financial
statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other
information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material
misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements
or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that
there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to
report in this regard.

OPINIONS ON OTHER MATTERS PRESCRIBED BY THE COMPANIES ACT 2006

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

- the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and

- the strategic report and the directors' report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal
requirements.

MATTERS ON WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT BY EXCEPTION

In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the course of the
audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report. We have nothing
to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you
if, in our opinion: - adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not
been received from branches not visited by us; or - the financial statements are not in agreement with the
accounting records and returns; or - certain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or
- we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS

As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as
the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for
assessing the company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the
company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

AUDITOR'S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance
with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or
error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. Irregularities, including
fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our
responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The
extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below: We have
undertaken high level reviews of the results and position of the company for the year in question, and have
considered the effects of the industry and wider economy on the company. We have made enquiries of
management regarding the company’s own risk assessment procedures and any identified irregularities, including
fraud, identified in the year. We have used our knowledge and understanding of the company's business, including
the remuneration of key management personnel, to assess how and where irregularities, including fraud, might
arise and we have planned our testing using a risk based approach. We have considered the potential for
irregularities, including fraud, in all our testing but have also carried out specific testing to comply with the ISA (UK)
requirements regarding management override of controls. As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs (UK), we
exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also: - Identify and
assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and
perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to
provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than
for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or
the override of internal control. - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the internal control. - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the
reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors. - Conclude on the
appropriateness of the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence
obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the
company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required
to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures
are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of
our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the company to cease to continue as a going
concern. - Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the
disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner
that achieves fair presentation. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other
matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant
deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. USE OF OUR REPORT

This report is made solely to the company's members, as a body, in accordance with chapter 3 of part 16 of the
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company's members those
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company's
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report. or for the opinions we have formed.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

YEAR ENDED 31 MAY 2024
1. GENERAL INFORMATION
The company is a private company limited by shares, registered in United Kingdom. The address of the registered
office is Citrus Group House, Diamond Way, Nene Park, Irthlingborough, Northamptonshire, NN9 5QF.
2. STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE
These financial statements have been prepared in compliance with FRS 102, ‘The Financial Reporting Standard
applicable in the UK and the Republic of Ireland’.
3. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis. Consolidation The company has taken
advantage of the exemption from preparing consolidated financial statements under Section 401 of the Companies
Act 2006 on the basis that it is a subsidiary undertaking and its results and position are included in the consolidated
accounts of its immediate parent company. Going concern The directors have given due regard to the financial
position of the company at the year end, at the date of signing and for a period of twelve months following this.
Based on the financial position of the company the directors are satisfied that the company has sufficient resources
and flexibility to be able to meet its liabilities as they fall due. Financial support is also available between group
companies if required. On this basis, the directors consider it appropriate to prepare the financial statements on the
going concern basis. Disclosure exemptions The entity satisfies the criteria of being a qualifying entity as defined in
FRS 102. Its financial statements are consolidated into the financial statements of Shorcontrol Safety Limited which
can be obtained from Naas Industrial Estate, Naas, Co Kildare, Ireland. As such, advantage has been taken of the
following disclosure exemptions available under paragraph 1.12 of FRS 102: (a) No cash flow statement has been
presented for the company. (b) No disclosure has been given for the aggregate remuneration of key management
personnel. Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty The preparation of the financial statements
requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. These
estimates and judgements are continually reviewed and are based on experience and other factors, including
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Revenue recognition
The turnover shown in the profit and loss account represents amounts receivable during the year, exclusive of
Value Added Tax. In respect of long-term contracts and contracts for on-going services, turnover represents the
value of work done in the year, including estimates of amounts not invoiced. Turnover in respect of long-term
contracts and contracts for on-going services is recognised by reference to the stage of completion. Income tax
The taxation expense represents the aggregate amount of current and deferred tax recognised in the reporting
period. Tax is recognised in profit or loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other
comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, tax is recognised in other comprehensive income or
directly in equity, respectively. Current tax is recognised on taxable profit for the current and past periods. Current
tax is measured at the amounts of tax expected to pay or recover using the tax rates and laws that have been
enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing
differences at the reporting date. Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent
that it is probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable
profits. Deferred tax is measured using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by
the reporting date that are expected to apply to the reversal of the timing difference. Operating leases Lease
payments are recognised as an expense over the lease term on a straight-line basis. The aggregate benefit of
lease incentives is recognised as a reduction to expense over the lease term, on a straight-line basis. Goodwill
Goodwill arises on business acquisitions and represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the
company's interest in the net amount of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired
business. Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. It is
amortised on a straight-line basis over its useful life. Where a reliable estimate of the useful life of goodwill or
intangible assets cannot be made, the life is presumed not to exceed ten years. Amortisation Amortisation is
calculated so as to write off the cost of an asset, less its estimated residual value, over the useful life of that asset
as follows:

Goodwill - 10% straight line

If there is an indication that there has been a significant change in amortisation rate, useful life or residual value of

an intangible asset, the amortisation is revised prospectively to reflect the new estimates. Tangible assets Tangible
assets are initially recorded at cost, and subsequently stated at cost less any accumulated depreciation and
impairment losses. Any tangible assets carried at revalued amounts are recorded at the fair value at the date of
revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost or valuation of an asset, less its residual value,
over the useful economic life of that asset as follows:

Short Leasehold Property —- Over term of the lease
Training & Safety - 25% straight line
Equipment

Fixtures & Fittings - 20% straight line
Motor Vehicles - 20% straight line
Equipment - 33% straight line

Investments Fixed asset investments are initially recorded at cost, and subsequently stated at cost less any
accumulated impairment losses. Impairment of fixed assets A review for indicators of impairment is carried out at
each reporting date, with the recoverable amount being estimated where such indicators exist. Where the carrying
value exceeds the recoverable amount, the asset is impaired accordingly. Prior impairments are also reviewed for
possible reversal at each reporting date.

Finance leases and hire purchase contracts

Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are recognised in the statement of financial position
as assets and liabilities at the lower of the fair value of the assets and the present value of the minimum lease
payments, which is determined at the inception of the lease term. Any initial direct costs of the lease are added to
the amount recognised as an asset. Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction
of the outstanding lease liability using the effective interest method. Finance charges are allocated to each period
so as to produce a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.

Defined contribution plans

Contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as an expense in the period in which the related service
is provided. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that the prepayment will lead to a
reduction in future payments or a cash refund. When contributions are not expected to be settled wholly within 12
months of the end of the reporting date in which the employees render the related service, the liability is measured
on a discounted present value basis. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as a finance cost in profit or loss
in the period in which it arises.

4. TURNOVER
