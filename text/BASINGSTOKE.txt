Chairman's Report
for the Year Ended 31 July 2024

This is my first report as Chair of Trustees at Basingstoke ITEC having succeeded Maxine Hart who was a
highly effective and well-liked leader for the charity during an especially demanding period of financial
rectitude and Ofsted inspection. I'd like to thank Maxine and indeed all our previous trustees for their
stewardship in guiding Basingstoke ITEC to the eve of its 40th birthday in 2025.

Small charitable providers like Basingstoke ITEC are fast disappearing from our skills landscape which is a
shame as they provide carefully planned programmes to local learners often with an increased focus on
wellbeing. As providers like us disappear, it is remarkable that Basingstoke ITEC has continued to flourish
despite a very challenging economic and skills funding landscape which so often benefits larger commercial
enterprise than the not-for-profile sector. That is not to say that the charity hasn't experienced severe
challenges this last year. We have reorganized our workforce and adapted our strategy to better equip us to
navigate the financial headwinds we've faced for some years. While some of this change has been difficult
for us, it has resulted in a leaner and more consolidated offer in which we specialize in IT apprenticeships
while diversifying into other emerging digilal opportunities. Financially, the charity returned its first
operating surplus in some years and looks ahead with renewed confidence.

The team at Basingstoke ITEC have secured new contracts to support the apprenticeship programme of a
world-renowned international IT company, a contract to be the preferred IT trainer for a world class
university and won tenders to deliver IT training for new county councils. The organisation's commitment to
quality is also reflected in our apprenticeship achievement rates which are significantly above the national
average. This is evidence of the carefully designed programmes, high quality advice & guidance and expert
teaching that our learners enjoy. Learners continue to feel safe and valued both in learning and in their
workplaces and are motivated to achieve merits or distinctions in the apprenticeship standards.

This year we welcomed two new trustees, Tom Rogers and Tina Easton. Tom has a wealth of experience in
the apprenticeship sector. His knowledge of the sector will be of great assistance to the board and the CEO.
Tina has worked for many years in the IT Sector having had a successful career at IBM. Her knowledge of
IT companies and business development will provide great support to the board and the CEO

We said goodbye to Jordan Lance and Dan Putty. Jordan has been a supportive of ITEC as a trustee and was
an ex-apprentice of ITEC so brought a unique view to his role. We wish him luck in his new role as a
director with a new company. After an incredible 20 years we said goodbye to Dan, Dan joined the board of
trustees in October 1994 and has enabled and supported the growth and development of ITEC. His
experience as a magistrate and a local councillor enabled him to provide knowledge and guidance to ITEC in
many challenging areas.

â€˜The future for our learners, employers and other stakeholders looks very promising. We shall continue to be
at the heart of Basingstoke supporting young people as well as working with employers further afield who
want to access our highly specialist IT training services. We will continue to deliver high quality outcomes
for our apprentices while also diversifying our offer to keep us relevant in a fast moving digital economy.

Report of the Trustees
for the Year Ended 31 July 2024

Basingstoke ITEC was established in 1985 and was a division of the Basingstoke Youth Action Trust Ltd (a
registered charity), to offer all young people, irrespective of their academic record or social issues a chance
to fulfil their potential. In 2017 the BYAT name was removed.

There is a Board of Trustees, this includes non-salaried Directors, Secretary, and a Chairman.

Basingstoke ITEC specialises in the delivery of Business Services with a particular focus on Information
Technology and Digital Skills. A range of apprenticeships standards are provided to meet the local and
national skill shortages.

The Local Enterprise Partnerships have listed digital skills, analytical and in particular cyber security and
software development as priority subjects for the country and in particular the regional M3 corridor and
Thames Valley in which ITEC predominantly operate. Additional data continues to demonstrate significant
digital and IT skills shortages for the M3 corridor, Thames Valley and across the home counties. The
number of jobs is increasing each quarter and salaries are increasing faster than other occupations, however
this significantly slowed in the last quarter of this academic year.

The trustees with the support of the Chief Executive Officer have a vision and strategic priorities to create a
curriculum based on the skills shortages for the employers we aim to serve.

Our curriculum offer is developed in conjunction with our vision, mission and strategic priorities that are
approved by our trustees and are developed to meet recognised and recorded skills shortages and needs of
the employers we support.

OBJECTIVES AND ACTIVITIES

Objectives and activities

The Charity's aims, and differences it seeks to make through its activities.

The advancement, education, and training of young people (and the upskilling of older workers)

through the development of their IT and business skills thus providing a solid foundation for their future
careers.

The Charity's strategies for achieving these aims.

Supporting the recruitment and training of apprentices for learners in skill shortage areas such as IT and
business-related areas.

The advancement, education, and training of adults on selected courses only. We will provide enrichment
training courses in addition to the apprenticeship.

requirements. Including mental health, sexual health, sexual harassment, and career development.
Achievement of these objectives encourages employers to retain apprenticeship learners and to integrate
them into their companies.

Allowing companies to retain and grow which allows us to draw down planned Education and Skills
Funding Agency ("EFSA")

Maximising EFSA funding and procuring income from non levy payers, levy payers, through levy transfer,
and our subcontract account with West Berkshire Training Consortium.

The significant activities undertaken to contribute to the achievement of the aims and objectives.

The company trains and finds employment for approximately 60 apprentices' a year in Information
communication technician, IT solutions, Cyber Security, Digital Support technician, IT Salesperson,
Business Administration, and Digital Marketing.

The directors have paid due regard to guidance issued by the Charity Commission in deciding what activities
the company should undertake and the measures it uses to assess success against planned aims.

The achievement and performance of the strategic priorities, aims and objectives are reviewed at board
meetings and measured against the ESFA contract and associated agencies performance measures.

The company is funded by the ESFA depending on how many apprentices are recruited by the

employers we create relationships with. The amount we can draw down for apprenticeships is based on the
number of employers we can contract with to deliver apprenticeships for their staff. There are many external
factors beyond the control of the organisation that can affect the number of apprenticeships we deliver. This
can include the wider economy and government policies.

All Apprenticeship standards have different funding levels which are decided by the ESFA in consultation
with Institute for apprenticeships.

The organisation has a strategy document in place which sets out the steps needed to achieve its aims,
including targets for tendering, recruiting apprentices and trainees, both levy

and non-levy, obtaining transfers of unspent levy funding. The board review progress against these targets
monthly.

The organisation has a marketing strategy which sets expectations for the regular business.

development activities and promotion of the ITEC brand to levy and non-levy employers including a social
media strategy, and continuous development of the website. The board review progress against these targets
at quarterly board meeting.

Public benefit

In reviewing the reporting year and considering objectives for the year ahead the Trustees have

had regard to the Charity Commission guidance on public benefit and the duty under S 17(5) of

the Charities Act 2011 and confirm that that public benefit is being achieved by:

" Delivering technical digital learning to 60 apprentices

" Demonstrating and outstanding pass rate of 100% and an achievement rate of 69%

" Developing new curriculums and programmes to support known skills shortages.

" During 2022/24 we continued to use our hardship fund to support young learners, this included providing
food parcels, laptops and additional software to support learning.

ACHIEVEMENT AND PERFORMANCE

Charitable activities

The aims of the company in training young people were vigorously pursued in line with our objectives and
those of the Education and Skills Funding Agency. 28 learners were enrolled during the accounting period.
Although the number of enrolments are down this is offset by higher funding levels for each enrolment.

75% of new learner starts is repeat business. 75% of our starts are from levy paying organisation and 25%
from SMEs.

The overall completion rate for this accounting period is 69%; this is compared a national average of 51%.
Our retention rate 66% is compared to the national average of 53%. This is distorted by low numbers Digital
Marketer for example has a retention rate of 100% , but ICT (4 people had a retention rate of 50%).

The aims of the company in training young people were vigorously pursued in line with our objectives and
those of the Education and Skills Funding Agency.

FINANCIAL REVIEW

Financial position

Financial position Against the backdrop of limited resources and uncertainties over funding, it is difficult to
plan more than one year ahead. At the year end the company had net assets of Â£116,597 and made a profit/
(loss) of Â£2,691 (2023(55,164)). Accordingly, the Board of Management had to implement a redundancy
plan to assure the long-term survival of the charity. The have had regular monthly meetings and are
confident that the outlook is more positive

Employers

Employer contributions count for approximately 1.1% of our annual income and we received.
Approximately 14.9% of income through delivery of subcontracted contracts.

The company plans continuing the activities outlined above in the forthcoming years subject to

satisfactory funding arrangements.

The directors meet quarterly and are updated regularly on the surplus and deficit and the effects of the new
funding and are confident of that although the next year might be challenging the projections are looking
favourable and will be constantly monitored. For the coming year.,

Reserves policy

The reserves policy for the company is to hold 3-6 month's expenditure as free reserves. Currently reserves
are within this range.

There are two sources of funding: Education Skills Funding Agency. Around 84% of our funding comes
from the ESFA, this funding is paid on the number of learners in training and the outcomes of these learners.

FUTURE PLANS
New trustees (once DBS checked) will also be invited to meet the learners to gain a good understanding of
our client base and their needs.
