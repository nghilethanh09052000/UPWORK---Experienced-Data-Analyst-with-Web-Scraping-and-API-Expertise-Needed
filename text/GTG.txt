STRATEGIC REPORT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023

The Directors present the strategic report for the year ended 31 December 2023.

Fair review of the business

The Company's principal activities during the year were the provision of industrial and administration training and
the provision of training for the road transport industry.

The Company's key financial and other performance indicators during the year were as follows:

2023 2022 Change
Revenue £14,756,100 £14,153,820 4%
Profit before tax £1;162,285 £982,793 18%
Modern Apprenticeship Training Programme:
“Achiever to Leaver” ratio 41 2.8:1
“Qualification Achievement Rate” 63% 60%

It is pleasing to report an uplift in turnover across all three of our training centers in Glasgow, Edinburgh and
Wolverhampton.

Our Logistics Department continued to experience a high demand for commercial driver training, while, in our
Automotive Department, technical courses for MOT Testing and electric and hybrid vehicles increased throughout
the year.

Skills Development Scotland (SDS) set several targets as part of the funding agreement for the Modern
Apprenticeship programmes. The “Achiever to Leaver" ratio, which measures the efficiency of the training provided,
is the number of candidates achieving qualification against the number of candidates leaving the programme prior to
completion. The ratio for 2023 was 4:1 (2022: 2.8:1) which is much higher than prior year and above the targets set
by SDS. It is pleasing to note the uplift in the Achiever to Leaver ratio.

In England, the Education and Skills Funding Agency use several key indicators to measure the quality of
apprenticeship training delivery including the “Qualification Achievement Rate”. In the year to 31st December 2023,
the Company’s “Qualification Achievement Rate” for English apprenticeships was 63% (2022: 60%).. Throughout
2023 there has been a greater uptake in Heavy Vehicle and Bus & Coach apprenticeship programmes and we
expect a further positive impact on the achievement rate into 2024.

Profit before tax for the year increased due to an increase in turnover which allowed the Company to continue to
invest in improvements to our training facilities and equipment, notably the expansion of our fleet of logistics
vehicles and we anticipate a strong performance in 2024.

Principal risks and uncertainties
The main risks associated with the Company's operations are set out below:

Interest rate risk: The Company's principal financial instruments comprise cash and cash equivalents. The
Company invests surplus cash in a floating rate interest yielding bank deposit account. The Company's interest
income and expenses are therefore affected by movements in interest rates. The Company does not undertake
active hedging of this risk. Other financial assets and liabilities, such as trade creditors and trade debtors, arise
directly from operating activities.

Credit risk: The Company has external debtors; however, the Company undertakes assessments of its customers
in order to ensure that credit is not extended where there is a likelihood of default.

Liquidity risk: The Company aims to mitigate liquidity risk by managing cash generated by its operations.

Reguiatory risk:: The Company actively monitors compliance with the various regulators’ requirements and has
established policies and procedures for ensuring effective compliance.

Accounting policies : (continued)

Revenue

Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer and excludes
amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The company recognises revenue when it transfers contro! of a
product or service to a customer.

When cash inflows are deferred and represent a financing arrangement, the fair value of the consideration is
the present value of the future receipts. The difference between the fair value of the consideration and the
nominal amount received is recognised as interest income.

Revenue is derived primarily from the delivery of training services. Our customers simultaneously receive and
consume the benefits provided by the Company's performance as the Company delivers the training.
Therefore, a time-based measure is appropriate for revenue recognition. Revenue is recognised in the month
the training takes place. If a full course is delivered within a month, then the performance obligation is wholly
satisfied in that time period. If the revenue relates to courses delivered over two months or more, the
proportion of future dated training is deferred and recognised on satisfaction of the performance obligation
over the remaining period. .

Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment are initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost or valuation,
net of depreciation and any impairment losses.

Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets fess their residual values over their
useful lives on the following bases:

. Land and buildings Freehold - 2% - 5%

Leasehold - As freehold or over the lease term where shorter
Plant and equipment Plant and training equipment - 10% - 25%
Computer equipment - 25%
a Fixture and fittings - 12% - 25%
Motor vehicles 16% - 35%

The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the sale proceeds
and the carrying value of the asset, and is recognised in the income statement. .

Impairment of tangible assets

At each reporting end date, the company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible assets to determine
whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication
exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment
loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the company
estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.

Accounting policies : . (continued)

Impairment of tangible assets (continued)

Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use,
the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the
estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.

If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying
amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An
impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued
amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.

Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit)
is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does
not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised
for'the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised
immediately in profit or loss, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the
reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term liquid
investments with original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown
within borrowings in current liabilities.

Financial assets

Financial assets are recognised in the company's statement of financial position when the company becomes,
party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets are classified into specified categories,
depending on the nature and purpose of the financial assets.

At initial recognition, financial assets classified as fair value through profit and loss are measured at fair value
and any transaction costs are recognised in profit or loss. Financial assets not classified as fair value through
profit and loss are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs.

Financial assets held at amortised cost

Financial instruments are classified as financial assets measured at amortised cost where the objective is to
hold these assets in order to collect contractual cash flows, and the contractual cash flows are solely
payments of principal and interest. They arise principally from the provision of goods and services to
customers (eg trade receivables). They are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs directly
attributable to their acquisition or issue, and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective
interest rate method, less provision for impairment where necessary.

Impairment of financial assets

Financial assets carried at at amortised cost are assessed for indicators of impairment at each reporting end
date.

The expected credit losses associated with these assets are estimated on a forward-looking basis. A broad
range of information is considered when assessing credit risk and measuring expected credit losses, including
past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the expected
collectability of the future cash flows of the instrument.

Derecognition of financial assets

Financial assets are derecognised only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or
when it transfers the financial asset and substantially ali the risks and rewards of ownership to another entity.

Financial liabilities

- The company recognises financial debt when the company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of

1.9

1.10:

the instruments. Financial liabilities are classified as either ‘Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or
loss’ or ‘Other financial liabilities’.

Other financial liabilities

Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, trade payables and other short-term monetary liabilities, are
initially measured at fair value net of transaction costs directly attributable to the issuance of the financial
liability. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. For the
purposes of each financial liability, interest expense includes initial transaction costs and any premium
payable on redemption, as well as any interest or coupon payable while the liability is outstanding.

Derecognition of financial liabilities .
Financial liabilities are derecognised when, and only when, the company's obligations are discharged,
cancelled, or they expire.

Equity instruments :

Equity instruments issued by the company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Dividends payable on equity instruments are recognised as liabilities once they are no longer at the discretion
of the company.

Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.

Current tax

The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as
reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or
deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The company's
liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the
reporting end date.

Deferred tax .

Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of
assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of
taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are
generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the
extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences
can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill
or from the initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor
the accounting profit.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting end date and reduced to the extent
that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be
recovered. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability
is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it
relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in
equity. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the company has a legally enforceable right to offset
current tax assets. and liabilities and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same
tax authority.

Accounting policies (continued)

Employee benefits

The costs of short-term employee benefits are recognised as a liability and an expense, unless those costs
are required to be recognised as part of the cost of inventories or non-current assets.

The cost of any unused holiday entitlement is recognised in the period in which the employee’s services are
received.

Termination benefits are recognised immediately as an expense when the company is demonstrably
committed to terminate the employment of an employee or to provide termination benefits.

Retirement benefits : :
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.

Leases

At inception, the company assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease within the scope of IFRS 16.A
contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a
period of time in exchange for consideration. Where a tangible asset is acquired through a lease, the
company recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. Right-of-use
assets are included within property, plant and equipment, apart from those that meet the definition of
investment property.

The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability
adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date plus any initial direct costs and
an estimate of the cost of obligations to dismantle, remove, refurbish or restore the underlying asset and the
site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received.

The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement
date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term. The
estimated useful lives of right-of-use assets are determined on the same basis as those of other property,
plant and equipment. The right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted
for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.

The tease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are unpaid at the
commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the tease or, if that rate cannot be readily
determined, the company's incremental borrowing rate. Lease payments included in the measurement of the
lease liability comprise fixed payments, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, amounts
expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, and the cost of any options that the company is
reasonably certain to exercise, such as the exercise price under a purchase option, lease payments in an
optional renewal period, or penalties for early termination of a lease.

The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when

there is a change in: future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate; the company's estimate

of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; or the company's assessment of ©
whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option. When the lease liability is remeasured in.

this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded

in profit or loss if the carrying arriount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.

Grants

Grants from the Government are recognised where ‘there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be
received and the Company will comply with all attached conditions.

Standards which are in issue but not yet effective

The Company has not adopted any new accounting standards in the current year or early adopted any
standards in issue but not yet effective as at the balance sheet date.

3 - Critical accounting estimates and judgements

Judgements

“The Company applies judgement in how it applies its accounting policies, which do not involve estimation, but
could materially affect the numbers disclosed in these financial statements. In the opinion of the Directors, the -
judgements made in the course of preparing these financial statements are not difficult, subjective or complex
to a degree that would warrant their description as significant.

Estimates

The preparation of the Company's financial statements requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the
accompanying disclosures and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. In the opinion of the Directors, the key
assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date are
not difficult, subjective or complex to a degree that would warrant their description as significant.
