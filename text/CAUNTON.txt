STRATEGIC REPORT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JANUARY 2024
- 1 -
The directors present the strategic report for the year ended 31 January 2024.
Section 172 of Companies Act 2006
Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 sets out a number of general duties that directors owe to a company. These includes a general duty requiring directors to act in a way in which they consider, in good faith, will promote the success of the company for the benefit of shareholders as a whole.
In doing so a director of a company must have regard (amongst other matters) to:
a. The likely consequences of any decision in the long term;
b. The interests of the company’s employees;
c. The need to foster the company’s business relationships with suppliers, customers and others;
d. The impact of the company’s operations on the community and the environment;
e. The desirability of the company maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct; and
f. The need to act fairly as between members of the company.
Further detail on the performance of the business during the year and the longer-term activity is provided in this strategic report.
Principal activities
The principal activity of the company throughout the year continued to be that of structural engineering.
Business review
This year we saw a strong Q1 and Q2 evaporate into a weak Q3 and Q4 resulting in a reduction in revenues for the period to £94.8m (2023 £120.5m) and net profit decreasing to £3.0m (2023 £7.4m). Our cash position remains strong though and we will continue with our strategic investment plans into 2024/5.
Principal risks and uncertainties
The principal risks facing the business stem from contracting, its demands, the terms and conditions and associated issues therein. To mitigate these risks significant time and resource is dedicated to contract negotiations at the outset.
There has also been a rise in the broader financial challenges that the business faces as the credit insurance and Bond market has tightened significantly during the year. We continue to manage this through regular dialogue with our financial partners and by working closely both upstream and downstream with customers and suppliers alike.
While any inflationary pressures across many of our input costs, especially raw materials, have been, and continue to be, managed as a pass-through cost, any uncertainty around price volatility and availability of raw materials are closely monitored and managed at bid stage. These challenges have eased in recent times. Our operational efficiency gains, ability to be flexible in both design and manufacture coupled with support from our supply chain enables us to mitigate these threats.
The development and publication of our Carbon Reduction Road Map illustrates our commitment at all levels of the business to reduce our impact on the environment.
Occupational Health and Safety standards are set very high within the construction industry. Failure to adhere to the standards can result in accidents and/or injuries that can prove fatal. This is therefore of great importance to the Board as any negative impact in this area not only affects the lives of those involved but the reputation of the business and potential future work.

STRATEGIC REPORT (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JANUARY 2024

Financial key performance indicators
Cash remains key to all businesses and we track our balances daily and constantly monitor our debtor and creditor days.
Net Profit on Sales is one of our primary indicators of performance as it takes into account the true running costs of the business in totality.
Our Forward Order Book of contracted sales gives us a clear look ahead of what resources both operationally and financially we need to plan to have in place.
Enquiries are measured in number, quality and value. Our conversion rates from tenders to contracts won by market sector and client along with the cost of servicing those markets and clients are monitored to ensure best returns.
With Health and Safety being such a critical factor we measure our AFR (accident frequency rate) and report this back to the Board throughout the year. We are pleased to report that our AFR remains lower than the industry average and we continue to work hard to drive this lower.
Quality, Environment and Safety
Caunton proudly retains its accredited standards for Quality, the Environment and Occupational Health and Safety (BS EN ISO 9001:2015; BS EN ISO 14001:2015; BS EN 45001:2018).
EWF Welding Standard ISO 3834 Part 2: 2005 underpins Caunton's ability to CE mark structural steelwork.
People
We continue to invest in our people at all levels. Our in-house Ofsted accredited Apprentice Training Academy celebrates its 20
th
anniversary this year, and has, to date, delivered 48 apprentices into the business since its inception. Our Degree Apprentices, Graduates and Apprentices now comprise 24% of our workforce. Wider people development and on-going CPD work ensures that we keep investing and promoting a culture of non-stop progression.
Outlook
As the various macroeconomic headwinds of, inflation, pricing volatility and energy costs begin to settle we remain mindful of the political challenges that elections at home and in the USA as well as the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East may present us with new challenges. At present though our outlook for 2024-2025 remains, on balance, a positive one. Our core markets remain relatively robust and we have secured a good forward order book and are seeing some excellent longer term prospects in the pipeline.
On behalf of the Board I would like to thank all our work colleagues who have shown great resilience, dedication and determination throughout the year.

Financial instruments
The
c
ompany holds or issues financial instruments in order to achieve three main objectives, being:
(a) to finance its operations;
(b) to manage its exposure to interest and currency risks arising from its operations and from its sources of
finance; and
(c) for trading purposes.
In addition, various financial instruments (e.g. trade debtors, trade creditors, accruals and prepayments) arise
directly from the
c
ompany's operations.
Transactions in financial instruments result in the
c
ompany assuming or transferring to another party one or
more of the financial risks described below.
Liquidity risk
The
c
ompany manages its cash and borrowing requirements in order to maximise interest income and
minimise interest expense, whilst ensuring the
c
ompany has sufficient liquid resources to meet the operating
needs of the business.
Interest rate risk
The
c
ompany is exposed to fair value interest rate risk on its fixed rate borrowings.
The directors monitor
institutional interest rates closely so as to reduce its exposure to changes in rates.

Credit risk
The
c
ompany monitors credit risk closely and considers that its current policies of credit checks meet its
objectives of managing exposure to credit risk.
The
c
ompany has no significant concentrations of credit risk. Amounts shown in the balance sheet best
represent the maximum credit risk exposure in the event other parties fail to perform their obligations under
financial instruments.
Disabled persons
Applications for employment by disabled persons are always fully considered, bearing in mind the aptitudes of the applicant concerned. In the event of members of staff becoming disabled, every effort is made to ensure that their employment within the company continues and that the appropriate training is arranged. It is the policy of the company that the training, career development and promotion of disabled persons should, as far as possible, be identical to that of other employees.
Employee involvement
The company's policy is to consult and discuss with employees, through staff councils and at meetings, matters likely to affect employees' interests.
Information about matters of concern to employees is given through information bulletins and reports which seek to achieve a common awareness on the part of all employees of the financial and economic factors affecting the company's performance.
Auditor
The auditor, Azets Audit Services, is deemed to be reappointed under section 487(2) of the Companies Act 2006.

DIRECTORS' REPORT (CONTINUED)

Statement of directors' responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of the profit or loss of the company for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements;
prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Statement of disclosure to auditor
So far as each person who was a director at the date of approving this report is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the company’s
auditor
is unaware. Additionally, the directors individually have taken all the necessary steps that they ought to have taken as directors in order to make themselves aware of all relevant audit information and to establish that the company’s
auditor
is aware of that information.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT
TO THE MEMBER OF CAUNTON ENGINEERING LIMITED
- 7 -
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Caunton Engineering Limited (the 'company') for the year ended 31 January 2024 which comprise the statement of comprehensive income, the balance sheet, the statement of changes in equity and notes to the financial statements, including significant accounting policies.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 102
The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
In our opinion the financial statements:
give a true and fair view of the state of the company's affairs as at 31 January 2024 and of its profit for the year then ended;
have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the
Auditor's
responsibilities for the audit of the
financial statements
section of our report. We are independent of the
company
in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the
financial statements
in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard
, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Conclusions relating to going concern
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.
Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.
Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report.
Other information
The other information comprises the information included in the annual report other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of our audit
:
the information given in the strategic report and the directors'
r
eport for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements
; and
the strategic report and the directors' report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
CAUNTON ENGINEERING LIMITED
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT (CONTINUED)
TO THE MEMBER OF CAUNTON ENGINEERING LIMITED
- 8 -
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identifie
d
material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors'
r
eport
.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
certain disclosures of
remuneration specified by law are not made; or
we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the directors'
r
esponsibilities
s
tatement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of
financial statements
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the
financial statements
, the
directors are
responsible for assessing the company
'
s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or have
no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements
as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an
auditor's
report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with
ISAs (UK)
will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these
financial statements
.
A further description of our responsibilities is available on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at: https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor's report.
CAUNTON ENGINEERING LIMITED
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT (CONTINUED)
TO THE MEMBER OF CAUNTON ENGINEERING LIMITED

Extent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud
Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above and on the Financial Reporting Council’s website, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud.
We obtain and update our understanding of the entity, its activities, its control environment, and likely future developments, including in relation to the legal and regulatory framework applicable and how the entity is complying with that framework.  Based on this understanding, we identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.  This includes consideration of the risk of acts by the entity that were contrary to applicable laws and regulations, including fraud.
In response to the risk of irregularities and non-compliance with laws and regulations, including fraud, we designed procedures which included:
Enquiry of management and those charged with governance around actual and potential litigation and claims as well as actual, suspected and alleged fraud;
Reviewing minutes of meetings of those charged with governance;
Assessing the extent of compliance with the laws and regulations considered to have a direct material effect on the financial statements or the operations of the company through enquiry and inspection;
Reviewing financial statement disclosures and testing to supporting documentation to assess compliance with applicable laws and regulations;
Performing audit work over the risk of management bias and override of controls, including testing of journal entries and other adjustments for appropriateness, evaluating the business rationale of significant transactions outside the normal course of business and reviewing accounting estimates for indicators of potential bias.
Because of the inherent limitations of an audit, there is a risk that we will not detect all irregularities, including those leading to a material misstatement in the financial statements or non-compliance with regulation.  This risk increases the more that compliance with a law or regulation is removed from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, as we will be less likely to become aware of instances of non-compliance.  The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
Use of our report
This report is made solely to the company’s member, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s member those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s
member
, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over their useful lives on the following bases:
Leasehold improvements
10 years straight line
Plant and machinery
15% on written down value or straight line over 15 years
Furniture, fittings and equipment
15% on written down value or straight line over 5 years
Motor vehicles
25% on written down value
The assets' residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted
prospectively if appropriate, or if there is an indication of a significant change since the last
reporting date.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying value of the asset, and
is credited or charged to profit or loss
.
1.6
Stocks
Stocks are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value, after making due allowance for
obsolete and slow moving items.
1.7
Construction contracts
Work in
p
rogress is valued at net cost, less foreseeable losses. Profit on short term contracts is
recognised as the work is carried out if the final outcome can be assessed with reasonable certainty.
Profit is ascertained in a manner appropriate to the stage of completion of the contract, by reference
to attributable turnover less costs incurred to date. Costs include subcontracting which is recognised
on the basis of applications received. No provision is made for retention-related expenditure unless
the cost of rectification work is known. Full provision is made for losses on all contracts in the year
they are first foreseen.
1.8
Cash at bank and in hand
Cash at bank and in hand
are basic financial assets
and
include cash in hand
and
deposits held at call with banks
.
1.9
Financial instruments
The company has elected to apply the provisions of Section 11 ‘Basic Financial Instruments’ and Section 12 ‘Other Financial Instruments Issues’ of FRS 102 to all of its financial instruments.
Financial instruments are recognised in the company's balance sheet when the company becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset
, with
the net amounts presented in the financial statements
,
when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Basic financial assets
Basic financial assets, which include
debtors
and cash and bank balances, are initially measured at transaction price including transaction costs
, less impairment.
Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets
are assessed for indicators of impairment at each reporting end date.
Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows have been affected.
The impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss.

Derecognition of financial assets
Financial assets are derecognised only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or are settled, or when
the company
transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to another entity
.
Classification of financial liabilities
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the company after deducting all of its liabilities.
Basic financial liabilities
Basic financial liabilities, including
creditors,
are
initially recognised at transaction price unless the arrangement constitutes a
financing transaction, where the debt instrument is measured at the present value of
the future
paymen
ts discounted at a market rate of interest.
Financial liabilities classified as payable within one year are not amortised.
Derecognition of financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the company’s contractual obligations
expire or are discharged or cancelled.
1.10
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of transaction costs. Dividends payable on equity instruments are recognised as liabilities once they are no longer at the discretion of the company.
1.11
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Current tax
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the
profit and loss account
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The
company’s
liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting end date.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all timing differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the timing difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting end date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date
. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the
statement of comprehensive income
, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the
company
has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority.

Retirement benefits
The
c
ompany operates a defined contribution plan for its employees. A defined contribution plan is
a pension plan under which the
c
ompany pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. Once the
contributions have been paid the
c
ompany has no further payment obligations.
The contributions are recognised as an expense in the statement of comprehensive income when
they fall due. Amounts not paid are shown in
other creditors
as a liability in the balance sheet. The assets
of the plan are held separately from the
c
ompany in independently administered funds.
1.13
Leases
Assets obtained under hire purchase contracts and finance leases are capitalised as tangible fixed
assets. Assets acquired by finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and
their useful lives. Assets acquired by hire purchase are depreciated over their useful lives. Finance
leases are those where substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership are assumed by the
c
ompany. Obligations under such agreements are included in creditors net of the finance charge
allocated to future periods. The finance element of the rental payment is charged to the profit and
loss account so as to produce a constant periodic rate of charge on the net obligation in each
period.
Operating lease rentals are charged as an expense in the profit and loss account on a straight line
basis.
1.14
Government grants
Grants are accounted under the accruals model as permitted by FRS 102. Grants relating to
expenditure on tangible fixed assets are credited to the statement of comprehensive income at the
same rate as the depreciation on the assets to which the grant relates. The deferred element of
grants is included in creditors as deferred income.
1.15
Foreign exchange
Transactions in currencies other than
pounds sterling
are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At each reporting end date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the reporting end date. Gains and losses arising on translation
in the period
are included in profit or loss.
1.16
Interest income
Interest income is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income using the effective interest
method.
1.17
Finance costs
Finance costs are charged to the statement of comprehensive income over the term of the debt
using the effective interest method so that the amount charged is at a constant rate on the carrying
amount
.

Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the company’s accounting policies, the directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised where the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods where the revision affects both current and future periods.
Critical judgements
The following judgements (apart from those involving estimates) have had the most significant
effect on amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Provisions for loss making contracts
Where losses on contracts are expected, the entire
forecasted
loss is recognised immediately within the profit and
loss account.
Stage of contract completion
Profit is recognised in the profit and loss account subject to the stage of completion and an assessment
of the value of work done on each contract, taking into consideration contract variations, estimated costs
to complete and forecast profitability.
Bad debt provision
The directors have reviewed the trading balances owing to the
c
ompany from its customers and made
adequate provision for any debts where it is considered probable that the amount will not be recovered.
The amounts would have otherwise been recognised in trade debtors.

Turnover and other revenue
The whole of the turnover is attributable to the one principal activity of the company.
