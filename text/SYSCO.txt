ACCOUNTING POLICTES

Basis of preparing the financial statements

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102 "The Financial
Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland” including the provisions of Section LA "Small Entities"
and the Companics Act 2006. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.

Going concern

After reviewing the company's forecasts and projections, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the company has
adequate resources to continue in operational existence and meet its debts for the foreseeable future not limited to a period of
12 months from the signing of these accounts. The company therefore continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing
the financial statements.

Significant judgements and estimates
Preparation of the financial statements requires management to make significant judgements and estimates. The items in the
financial statements where these judgements and estimates have been made include:

Depreciation and residual values

The directors have reviewed the asset lives and associated residual values of all fixed asset classes, and in particular, the
useful economic life and residual values of property improvements, fixtures and fittings, motor vehicles and computer
equipment, and have concluded that the asset lives and residual values are appropriate.

Turnover
Turnover is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, excluding discounts, rebates, value added
tax and other sales taxes.

Goodwill
Goodwill, being the amount paid in connection with the acquisition of the business in 2006, is being amortised evenly over
its estimated useful life of fifteen years.

Intangible assets
Intangible assets are initially measured at cost. After initial recognition, intangible assets are measured at cost less any
accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.

Tangible fixed assets
Depreciation is provided at the following annual rates in order to write off the cost less estimated residual value of each asset
over its estimated useful life.

Improvements to property - over 15 years

Fixtures and fittings - 25% on reducing balance
Motor vehicles - 25% on reducing balance
Computer equipment - 25% on reducing balance

ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued

Financial instruments
The following assets and liabilities are classed as financial instruments - related party loans, trade debtors and trade creditors.

Trade debtors and trade creditors are measured at transaction price.

Other loans including related party loans are initially measured at fair value and are measured subsequently at amortised cost
using the effective interest method.

Taxation
Taxation for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Income Statement, except to the extent that
it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.

Current or deferred taxation assets and liabilities are not discounted.

Current tax is recognised at the amount of tax payable using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the statement of financial position date.

Deferred tax

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the statement of
financial position date.

Timing differences arise from the inclusion of income and expenses in tax assessments in periods different from those in
which they are recognised in financial statements. Deferred tax is measured using tax rates and laws that have been enacted
or substantively enacted by the year end and that are expected to apply to the reversal of the timing difference.

Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that they will be
recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.

Hire purchase and leasing commitments
Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to profit or loss on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.

Pension costs and other post-retirement benefits
The company operates a defined contribution pension scheme. Contributions payable to the company's pension scheme are
charged to profit or loss in the period to which they relate.

EMPLOYEES AND DIRECTORS

The average number of employees during the year was 22 (2023 - 27).
