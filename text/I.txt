Financial instruments
he company has elected to apply the provisions of Section 11 ‘Basic Financial Instruments’ and Section
2 ‘Other Financial Instruments Issues’ of FRS 102 to all of its financial instruments.

Basic financial assets:

Basic financial assets, which include debtors and cash and bank balances, are initially measured at
ransaction price including transaction costs and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the
effective interest method unless the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where the
ransaction is measured at the present value of the future cash flows discounted at a market rate of
interest. Financial assets classified as receivable within one year are not amortised.

Classification of financial liabilities:

Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual
arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the
assets of the company after deducting alll of its liabilities.

Basic financial liabilities:

Basic financial liabilities, including creditors and bank loans, are initially recognised at transaction price
unless the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where the debt instrument is measured at
the present value of future cash flows discounted at a market rate of interest. Financial liabilities
classified as payable within one year are not amortised.

Debt instruments are subsequently carried at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.

Trade creditors are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary
course of business from suppliers. Amounts payable are classified as current liabilities if the payment is
due within one year or less. If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities. Trade creditors are
recognised initially at transaction price and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the
effective interest rate method.

Taxation

Taxation for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Statement of
Income and Retained Earnings, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other
comprehensive income or directly in equity.

Current or deferred taxation assets and liabilities are not discounted.

Current tax is recognised at the amount of tax payable using the tax rates and laws that have been
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued

Deferred tax

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at
he balance sheet date.

Timing differences arise from the inclusion of income and expenses in tax assessments in periods
different from those in which they are recognised in financial statements. Deferred tax is measured using
ax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the period end and that are
expected to apply to the reversal of the timing difference.

Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable
hat they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.

Hire purchase and leasing commitments

Assets obtained under hire purchase contracts or finance leases are capitalised in the balance sheet.
Those held under hire purchase contracts are depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Those held
under finance leases are depreciated over their estimated useful lives or the lease term, whichever is
the shorter.

The interest element of these obligations is charged to profit or loss over the relevant period. The capital
element of the future payments is treated as a liability.

Pension costs and other post-retirement benefits

The company operates a defined contribution pension scheme. Contributions payable to the
company's pension scheme are charged to profit or loss in the period to which they relate.

EMPLOYEES AND DIRECTORS

The average number of employees during the period was 42 (2023 - 25).
