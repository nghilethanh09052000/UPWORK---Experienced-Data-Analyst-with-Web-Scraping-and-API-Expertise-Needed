ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of preparing the financial statements

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102 "The Financial
Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland” including the provisions of Section LA "Small Entities"
and the Companics Act 2006. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.

Turnover
Turnover is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, excluding discounts, rebates, value added
tax and other sales taxes.

Tangible fixed assets
Depreciation is provided at the following annual rates in order to write off each asset over its estimated useful life.

Stocks
Stocks are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable valuc, after making duc allowance for obsolete and slow moving
items.

Taxation
Taxation for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Income Statement, except to the extent that
it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.

Current or deferred taxation assets and liabilities are not discounted.

Current tax is recognised at the amount of tax payable using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the balance sheet date.

Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date.

Timing differences arise from the inclusion of income and expenses in tax assessments in periods different from those in
which they are recognised in financial statements. Deferred tax is measured using tax rates and laws that have been enacted
or substantively enacted by the year end and that are expected to apply to the reversal of the timing difference.

Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that they will be
recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.

Hire purchase and leasing commitments
Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to profit or loss on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.

Pension costs and other post-retirement benefits

The company operates a defined contribution pension scheme. Contributions payable to the company's pension scheme are
charged to profit or loss in the period to which they relate.
