NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
for the Year Ended 30th September 2023

1. STATUTORY INFORMATION

Mantra Learning Limited is a private company, limited by share capital and incorporated in England and
Wales, registration number 02743170. The address of the registered office and principal place of business is Greengate,
Middleton, Manchester, M24 1RU.

2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of preparing the financial statements

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102 "The Financial
Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland" including the provisions of Section 1A "Small Entities" and
the Companies Act 2006. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by
the revaluation of certain assets.

Turnover

Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Company and the
revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is measured as the fair value of the consideration received or receivable,
excluding discounts, rebates, value added tax and other sales taxes. The following criteria must also be met before
revenue is recognised:

Rendering of services

Revenue from a contract to provide services is recognised in the period in which the services are provided in accordance
with the stage of completion of the contract when all of the following conditions are satisfied:

- the amount of revenue can be measured reliably;

- it is probable that the Company will receive the consideration due under the contract;

- the stage of completion of the contract at the end of the reporting period can be measured reliably; and

- the costs incurred and the costs to complete the contract can be measured reliably.

Intangible fixed assets
Intangible assets are initially recognised at cost. After recognition, under the cost model, intangible assets are
Intangible assets are represented by:

- Deferred development expenditure which is capitalised where there is a clearly defined project, related
expenditure is separately identifiable and it has been assessed for technical and commercial viability.

Amortisation is calculated to write off the cost of the intangible assets over their useful life as follows:

Goodwill - 10% on cost
Development costs - 10% on cost

The carrying amounts of the company's assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances

indicate that the carrying amount of the fixed asset may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists, the asset's
recoverable amount is estimated and an impairment provision made if appropriate.

for the Year Ended 30th September 2023

2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued

Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.

Depreciation on tangible fixed assets is charged to the profit and loss so as to write off their value, over their estimated
useful lives, using the following methods:

Freehold property - not depreciated

Long leasehold - over the term of the lease
Plant and machinery - 15% reducing balance
Fixtures and fittings - 15% reducing balance
Motor vehicles - 25% reducing balance
Computer equipment - 33% on cost

At each balance sheet date, the Company reviews the carrying amounts of its fixed assets to determine whether there is
any indication that any items have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of an
asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss, if any. Where it is not possible to estimate the
recoverable amount of the asset, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the
asset belongs.

If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is
reduced to its recoverable amount. Impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.

Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are recognised at cost.

Taxation
Taxation for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the profit and loss account, except to the
extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.

Current or deferred taxation assets and liabilities are not discounted.

Current tax is recognised at the amount of tax payable using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.

Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet
date.

Timing differences arise from the inclusion of income and expenses in tax assessments in periods different from those in
which they are recognised in financial statements. Deferred tax is measured using tax rates and laws that have been
enacted or substantively enacted by the year end and that are expected to apply to the reversal of the timing difference.

Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that they will be
recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.

2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued

Hire purchase and leasing commitments

Assets that are held by the Company under leases which transfer to the Company substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership are classified as being held under finance leases. Leases which do not transfer substantially all the risks and
rewards of ownership to the company are classified as operating leases.

Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to profit or loss on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.

Assets held under finance leases are initially recognised as assets of the Company at their fair value at the inception of the
lease or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included
in the statements of financial position as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance
expenses and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the
liability, finance expenses are recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless they are directly attributable to qualifying
assets, in which case they are capitalised in accordance with the Company's policy on borrowing costs . Contingent rentals
are recognised as expenses in the periods in which they are incurred.

Pension costs and other post-retirement benefits
The company operates a defined contribution pension scheme. Contributions payable to the company’s pension scheme are
charged to profit or loss in the period to which they relate.

Trade and other debtors

Trade and other debtors are initially recognised at fair value and thereafter stated at amortised cost using the effective
interest method, less impairment losses for bad and doubtful debts except where the effect of discounting would be
immaterial. In such cases, the receivables are stated at cost less impairment losses for bad and doubtful debts.

Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand. Any bank overdrafts are shown within current liabilities,

Trade and other creditors
Trade and other creditors are initially recognised at fair value and thereafter stated at amortised cost using the effective
interest method unless the effect of discounting would be immaterial, in which case they are stated at cost.

3. EMPLOYEES AND DIRECTORS

The average number of employees during the year was 125 (2022 - 117).
