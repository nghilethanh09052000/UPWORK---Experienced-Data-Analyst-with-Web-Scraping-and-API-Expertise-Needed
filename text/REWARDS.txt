Notes to the Unaudited Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 July 2024

Tangible assets
Tangible assets are stated in the balance sheet at cost, less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and
subsequent accumulated impairment losses.

The cost of tangible assets includes directly attributable incremental costs incurred in their acquisition and
installation.

Depreciation
Depreciation is charged so as’ to write off the cost of assets, other than land and properties under construction’
over their estimated useful lives, as follows:

Asset class Depreciation method and rate
F & F and equipment : 25% on reducing balance

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and call deposits, and other short-term highly liquid
investments that are readily convertible to a. known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of
change in value: ,

Trade debtors
Trade debtors are amounts due from customers for merchandise sold or services performed in the ordinary
course of business.

Trade debtors are recognised initially at the transaction price. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost
using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. A provision for the impairment of trade
debtors is established when there is objective evidence that the company will not be able to collect all amounts
due according to the original terms of the receivables.

Trade creditors

Trade creditors are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinaty course of
business from suppliers. Accounts payable are. classified as current liabilities if the company does not have an
unconditional right, at the end of the reporting period, to defer settlement of the creditor for at least twelve
months after the reporting date. If there is an unconditional right to defer settlement for at least twelve months
after the reporting date, they are presented as non-current liabilities.

Trade creditors are recognised initially at the transaction price and subsequently measured at amortised cost
using the effective interest method.

Borrowings

Interest-bearing borrowings are initially recorded at fair value, net of transaction costs. Interest-bearing
borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised cost, with the difference between the proceeds, net of
transaction costs, and the amount due on redemption being recognised as a charge to the profit and loss account
over the period of the relevant borrowing.

Interest expense is recognised on the basis of the effective interest method and is included in interest payable
and similar charges.

Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the company has an unconditional right to defer settlement
of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting date.

Leases

Leases in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as
operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over
the period of the lease.

Share capital :
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Equity instruments are measured at the fair value of the cash or other
resources received or receivable, net of the direct costs of issuing the equity instruments. If payment is deferred
and the time value of money is material, the initial measurement is on a present value basis.

Dividends
Dividend distribution to the company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the
reporting period in which the dividends are declared.
