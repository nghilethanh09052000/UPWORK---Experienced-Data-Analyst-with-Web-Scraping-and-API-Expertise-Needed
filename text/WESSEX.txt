Strategic Report

Strategic Report
Chairman’s Foreword

These are challenging times for the water sector. The need for environmental performance
and resilience is increasing as cost-of-living pressures continue to squeeze household
budgets. Meanwhile, global warming is associated. with more extreme weather and, in the UK,
will lead to drier summers and wetter winters. It is essential that we provide resilient water and
wastewater services throughout these changes. We are proud to play our part in taking these
challenges on.

It is a significant time of change for Wessex Water and the wider YTL UK group. The next few
months will feature leadership changes and the launch of a major new cross-sector delivery
business, which underline YTL’s long-term commitment to infrastructure in the UK.

After 36 years of service as Chief Executive, Colin Skellett will hand over the reins at Wessex
Water to our Chief Compliance Officer Ruth Jefferson. Colin leaves the most incredible legacy.
Colin took the business through the early years of privatisation, steered it through the turbulent
times of Enron ownership and, under his leadership, has built Wessex Water in to a top
performer that YTL has been proud to own for the past 22 years. Colin has the greatest
admiration and standing in the sector and, together with the whole Board, | extend my sincere
thanks for all he has done.

We look forward to Ruth picking up the baton. She brings a strong focus on performance and
compliance, which is of ever-increasing importance and has played an instrumental role in
building wide stakeholder engagement and support to a new approach to environmental
regulation. The Wessex Water Board and the whole team are looking forward to working with
her to build on our strong base and realise our future ambitions.

The Wessex Water team has made promising progress in championing a new approach to
environmental regulation with the Sustainable Solutions for Water and Nature (SSWAN)
partnership. The partnership proposes a different model that can deliver better outcomes for
customers, the environment and water users across whole catchments. Colin explains more
about this and the use of catchment and nature-based solutions to deliver more efficiently in
his review on page 5 and the case study on page 7. In view of the multiplicity of challenges
ahead for water, we need this kind of collaborative, creative approach — and | urge all
interested parties to get involved with SSWAN’s ongoing programme.

River health is a priority and we are taking action to improve our performance. In common with
other English water companies, every storm overflow on the Wessex Water network is now
monitored — a world-leading position for the English water industry — and we are using Artificial
Intelligence (Al) to survey our sewerage network. These technologies are providing better
visibility, data and alerts which will enable faster responses, allow for preventative action and
guide our capital investment choices.

We understand that the demands of the public, media and politicians for healthier water
courses has rightly grown stronger. Within this context, we are painfully aware that our storm
overflows spilled for longer than they did in the previous year. This was driven by exceptional
rainfall, with 2023 being one of the wettest on record in our region. Despite this, we are
encouraged by the reduction in our serious pollution numbers reported in the year and that
Wessex Water was recognised with a four-star rating on environmental performance, the
highest rating possible. We are now working with government and regulators to explore the

Wessex Water Services Ltd 2

Strategic Report

significant opportunity to deliver nature-based solutions to reduce spill frequency and duration
in future as part of the overall solution.

The cost of living remained high in 2023 and many of our customers continued to experience
economic hardship. We responded by making our support packages for vulnerable customers
and those struggling to pay their bills more visible and easier to access. This included auto-
enrolling just under 5,000 eligible customers on to our schemes data shares with government.
We beat our target of securing 2,300 successful applications for financial assistance, by more
than 400 applications.

More broadly, our customer service continues to lead the industry.

Our capital investment increased by 41% in the year from £325m to £456m, driven by the
profiling of the WINEP delivery programme, the impact of delays to work arising from the
Covid-19 period, strategic maintenance projects and increased cost of inputs to construction.
Dividends declared by the Board were reflective of our performance and represented a 5.0%
return on investment. We are soundly financed and, as responsible investors, YTL stands
ready to invest in Wessex Water's future, for a fair return. We would, however, like to see
regulation evolve in line with the SSWAN proposals to allow for much better use of nature—
based solutions alongside traditional approaches; this will ensure the solutions we deliver are
truly sustainable for water and nature and best value for all.

YTL Construction UK is a new venture which will bring together YTL’s global expertise and
supply chains with Wessex Water's capabilities to create a new construction business. The
new business will work across all major construction areas, including opportunities within the
wider UK water industry which has proposed a £100 billion expenditure programme over the
next five years. | am delighted that Colin will continue as Group Chief Executive of YTL UK
and John Thompson, Chief Operating Officer of Wessex Water, will move across to lead the
construction business.

These changes further strengthen our ability to take on the coming challenges. At the time of
writing, Wessex Water's response to the draft determination for 2025-30 remains subject to
regulatory approval. However, we are committed to delivering record levels of investment and
working towards a future where: rivers are healthier and no longer blighted by regular storm
overflow spills and excess nutrients; everyone is confident water supplies remain safe, clean
and sustainable; our carbon footprint is going down not up; water is affordable for everyone;
as well as working to support nature and biodiversity every day as we deliver our services.

As always, | am very grateful for the dedication of all our Wessex Water colleagues and
business partners; they have shown great service and resilience in the face of significant
pressure. There are many years of investment, delivery and improvement ahead and | look
forward to Wessex Water realising our ambitious plan with YTL’s strong support.

| thank the Lord Jesus for His constant grace and guidance and pray that we continue to rise
up to the challenges we face

Strategic Report

Chief Executive’s Review

This is my final Annual Report as Wessex Water's Chief Executive. It has been a privilege to
lead the company from its formative years, to oversee the delivery of so much improvement
for customers and the environment and to help build the industry-leading organisation we have
today.

But the work is far from done. We are at a crucial point for the water industry to meet the
challenges of climate change, low carbon, customer expectations and restoring trust. Dealing
with storm overflow discharges and doing more to support river health is at the top of the public
agenda and therefore ours. We also need to decarbonise and supply a growing population,
whilst reducing the amount of water we abstract and help to improve the natural environment.
This all comes at a time of climatic, technological and societal change, and when people can
least afford to pay for expensive single-problem fixes.

For all these reasons, | want to look to the future rather than the past as | step back from
leading the company. A key feature of our work this year has been as part of the Sustainable
Solutions for Water and Nature (SSWAN) coalition, which has crafted a new vision for the
water environment. Together with Green Alliance, The Rivers Trust, RSPB, The Wildlife
Trusts, Sustainability First, CIWEM and Water UK, we propose replacing today’s fragmented
regulatory model with a catchment-wide approach which works across sectors and prioritises
efficient, nature-based and low carbon solutions. Alignment of the regulatory functions that
govern water, farming, planning and housing development within a common overall
framework, focused on achieving better environmental, social and economic outcomes, will
ensure we have clean, healthy rivers, delivered and paid for in the most efficient way.

The SSWAN project envisages refreshed roles for Government, regulators and regulated
companies and the creation of new Catchment Advisory Boards (CABs) which would advise
regulators on desired outcomes based on local priorities, taking account of what is achievable
and at what cost. The CABs would also provide an ongoing monitoring role; non-compliance
would have strong consequences, with penalties consistent with the ‘polluter pays’ principle.
More information on the thinking can be found at www.sswan.co.uk.

We now need to bring the ideas to life. Project SSWAN has some specific asks of the
government, as shown in the box. My successor, Ruth Jefferson, has been heavily involved
in the work and | know will continue to champion it with our partners.

To have the legitimacy to advocate for change, our day-to-day performance has to be good.
In 2022, we were not content with our performance and have been determined to improve.
Whilst we have performed well in some areas, such as customer satisfaction, we have missed
key targets, notably sewer flooding, where there remains more to do. | am however,
particularly pleased that Wessex Water recovered its four-star environmental rating from the
Environment Agency. | thank all our teams, whose focus and vigilance contributed to us
recovering our position.

Let me also highlight a broader point, given the media coverage of the financial fragility of
some water companies. Wessex Water is not in that position. YTL has been our sole owner
for 22 years and has maintained a simple structure, with a straightforward and ethical
approach to financing. Our financial foundations are strong and we are committed to the long-
term sustainable stewardship of our business.

Strategic Report

We need to continue to build our resilience to the rapidly changing climate, as 2023
demonstrated. It was one of the wettest years on record and inevitably this affected many of
our operations. The high rainfall resulted in a significant increase in storm overflow discharges,
as well as more sewer flooding and minor pollution incidents. We take this deterioration in our
performance very seriously.

We are investing £3 million each month on storm overflows — rising to over £6 million a month
after 2025, subject to regulatory approval. We have deployed monitors on every overflow in
our region to guide our priorities and we are working at pace to deliver both asset and nature-
based solutions to protect properties and waterways, as well as to provide better information
to users of our coastal and inland waters.

The wet weather means we can be certain that there will be no need for any restrictions on
water use — maintaining our 48-year record of no restrictions. However, the climate change
effect of greater variation in temperature and rainfall does impact on ground movements that
can cause damage to our pipes. Even so, in 2023, we reduced our annual average level of
leakage by 1.4 Mi/d (2.0%) from 71.2MI/d to 69.8MlI/d. This result was achieved by pressure
management and leakage control improvements, which included installing over 6,000
permanent acoustic loggers in our network to aid leak detection.

We also had a successful year in other ways. The quality of drinking water we supplied looks
set to be recognised as industry leading. We had the fewest customer complaints of all water
companies and maintained our long-standing top performance on customer service and
community engagement, reflected in our leading C-MeX score and excellent TrustPilot rating.
Our campaign to raise awareness of the help available to customers struggling to pay their
bills and making it easier to access this help, resulted in even more customers getting the help
they needed from our tailored assistance programme. In addition, we provided over £500,000
of grants through our charitable Wessex Water Foundation.

tn October 2023 we submitted our business plan for 2025-30 to Ofwat. The plan sets out our
proposal for transforming water and wastewater services to meet modern expectations —
particularly getting sewage, nutrients and other pollution out of rivers. This is the first of an
important step on a long journey in which there are no quick fixes, despite the urgency of the
call for change. In July, Ofwat published its draft view of our plan which we responded to at
the end of August. More details of our response can be found at
https://corporate.wessexwater.co.uk/our-future/business-plan-2025-2030/updates-to-our-

business-plan-2025-30. We now await Ofwat’s final decisions in December.

We are passionate about the multiple benefits of nature-based solutions and want to deliver
the outcomes our customers demand in the cleanest, greenest and most cost-effective ways
possible. We need to move away from short-term five year price settlements to unlock this
potential. We will continue to work with government, regulators, water companies,
campaigners, customers, communities and delivery bodies across the water, agriculture,
industry and development sectors to back SSWAN's vision for more sustainable solutions for
water and nature.

sufficient investment in the water system, using existing
enforcement tools

. Set a framework to deliver long-term resilience,
established by an independent body, and requiring
water companies and regulators to deliver against the
framework.

We owe it to the thousands who work in this industry, those just coming in such as the 92
apprentices and graduates we took on this year, and the millions who depend on its essential
services to get this right. | know Wessex Water, under its new leadership, will play a leading

LPN seaias Jalen, xassayy,

Nature and the recovery of our rivers, lakes and coastal waters
are at the heart of a pioneering call to action for policymakers,
regulators and the wider industry.

Alongside other organisations, including Water UK and
environmental groups, we have shared groundbreaking
proposals for regulatory reform of the water industry. The new
approach we are collectively suggesting focuses on whole
catchment areas working together and using nature-based and
low carbon solutions.

The SSWAN (Sustainable Solutions for Water and Nature)
coalition has issued a call to action for policymakers and
regulators, alongside a discussion paper that explains how we
could all be working differently to achieve better outcomes for
nature. This would see environmental targets set ata
catchment level and include all stakeholders, such as water
companies, farmers, industry and housing developers in the
local area.

The new approach was formed after months of engagement and
discussion led by us, between different groups across the sector
including CIWEM, RSPB England, The Rivers Trust and The
Wildlife Trusts.

Group Sustainability Director Guy Thompson said:

“If implemented, SSWAN will make it much easier for water
companies to work in partnership to find the right solution for
each river, coast and lake in their region. And it will mean we can
make the best use of the significant investment going into our
water systems and communities.

“I'm really proud to see us leading the charge with the SSWAN
initiative. We have a long way to go, but hopefully in the future,
this proposed new regulatory approach will help accelerate the
recovery of our rivers, coasts and nature in our catchments.”

Overview

Though there remain some critical areas to work on, it is rewarding to see the hard work reflected in this year’s data.

in common with 2022, our customers continued to feel the impact of high living costs on their household budgets in 2023 and
affordability remained a priority for us. But weatherwise, it was a very different year. Issues arising from the drought and heatwaves
of 2022 were replaced by challenges from exceptional levels of rainfall. The 12 months between March 2023 and February 2024
were the wettest on record (since 1871) in our region, with an average accumulation of 1310mm, equating to 155% of the long-term
average rainfall. High rainfall levels persisted throughout this period, with nine of these 12 months individually above the long-term
average, some by around 250%. Meanwhile, mild temperatures made the year the secand warmest on record. The reality of climate
change is with us, as are the growing challenges that come with it.

Against this backdrop, in three of the four areas that fall within the ‘Serving people and places’ area, we continued to provide leading
levels of service: safe and reliable water supply, affordable bills and great customer experience, Some highlights included:

* our Compliance Risk Index score was industry-leading and our Event Risk Index score was a significant improvement on last year;
these are the two key measures of drinking water quality

© onaffordability, we remain committed to our pledge to end water poverty by 2030 despite the increasingly difficult economic
context. This year we have focused on boosting access to the wide range of financial support we provide under our tailored
assistance programme (tap) to ensure even more customers get the help they need. We have also continued to provide support
and grants through our charitable Wessex Water Foundation

© ‘our ongoing focus on delivering great customer service resulted in us remaining a leading performer in the range of relevant
customer service metrics, including being the top water and sewerage company on Ofwat's measure of customer experience,
C-Mex.

However, our wastewater network struggled under the persistent heavy rain and the number of sewer floods that happened both
inside and outside of people's properties regrettably increased. With more extreme weather likely to be a feature of the future, we are
now using Al technology to detect defects, such as collapses and obstructions caused by wet wipes, along our many miles of sewer
network. This will help us to speed up our response times - see case study, Al insight helping to protect rivers, seas and homes on
page 19.

Asingle, but significant, trunk mains burst in Chippenham in February 2024 also hit our supply interruptions performance this year.
However, amongst water companies, we remain in the leading pack.

Our journey :
Our long-term ambitions for serving people and places are set out in our Strategic Direction Statement. We are targeting:

© 100% water quality compliance

* zero water supply interruptions of longer than three hours

* halving the impact of sewer flooding

zero water poverty - no one will spend more than 5% of their disposable income on water
* being atop 10 customer service provider across all companies in the UK.

In the following pages, we set out how we have performed against our regulatory performance commitments for serving
people and places.

Safe and reliable water supply

Drinking water quality

High quality drinking water is a fundamental requirement for
customers. We are pleased to report improvements across all
relevant metrics in 2023 from an already high base and were
industry-leading among water and sewerage companies on the
Compliance Risk Index (CRI), which is one of two measures used by
the Drinking Water Inspectorate (DWI) to measure drinking water
quality compliance,

The Drinking Water Inspectorate (DWI) measures drinking water
quality compliance using two main metrics: the Compliance

Risk Index (CRI) and the Event Risk Index (ERI). We received our
confirmed CRI score from the DWI in July with an industry-leading
score of 0.93 - which is also an improvement on our 2022 score of

The other measure used by the DWI is the Event Risk Index (ERI).
Our ERI score of 24 is a considerable improvement on last year's very
disappointing score of 403 - although even then we outperformed
the industry average. We reported 22 events to the Dwlin 2023.

We capture learnings from each event and put in place preventative
measures to increase resilience.

We registered fewer complaints from customers about the taste,
odour or appearance of their water in 2023: 1,404 contacts from
the 1.4 million customers we supply, the lowest level ever and
continuing a five-year downwards trend. Our success here is in
part because we investigate the source of every contact and
target our actions accordingly.

regrettably resulted in a significant increase in minutes lost -

from an average of 4 minutes 10 seconds in 2022 to an average

of 5 minutes 35 seconds in 2023. A burst ona trunk main just
downstream of the service reservoir in Chippenham left 3,000
customers off supply until a repair was carried out. Where it was
feasible to do so, we prevented the burst from affecting even more
customers by re-routing water from other supply zones.

An effective sewerage system

Sewer flooding

In contrast to our drinking water quality performance, we are
disappointed that we have not met our sewer flooding targets.

We accept that this is a significant shortcoming, given the
devastating impacts sewer flooding can have for customers. Whilst
this is the result of extremely wet weather that has characterised
2023, we will build more resilience into our system.

There were 202 sewer floods inside properties (internal) in the
year, up from 168 in 2022. This is a rate of 1.56 incidents per
10,000 sewer connections, above our target of 1.44.

Any flooding incident is one too many and we are determined to
reduce the number next year.

In last year's annual review summary, we welcomed news that the
government intended to ban plastics in wet wipes, given 90% of
external and 85% of internal sewer flooding incidents are a result
of sewer blockages, with wipes the single largest cause of those
blockages. In April 2024, the government confirmed legislation
would be introduced to implement the ban by the end of the year.
We hope the incoming government remains similarly committed.
We believe this will significantly reduce the number of customers
blighted by sewer flooding.

capacity to support growth and cope with climate change. In
fact, although we had intended to complete the scheme in March
2023, we actually finished it early, in December 2022,

Affordable bills

Financial vulnerability

Our commitment to supporting every customer to be able to
afford their water bill is long established. We provide extensive
financial and debt support through a range of schemes and
low-rate tariffs under our tailored assistance programme (tap)
and each year we build on past progress.

Our commitment remains, even as the context changes.
Importantly, we remain resolved to achieve zero water poverty
by 2030 (defined as no one spending more than 5% of their
disposable income on water) despite average bills rising for the
second consecutive year this year and customers continuing to
battle with the wider cost of living crisis.

In 2023, we focused on making help easier and quicker to access
and improving the customer journey. We made the following
changes in the year:

* auto-enrolled just under 5,000 customers to schemes via
data shares with councils and the Department for Work and
Pensions

* continued to fast-track customers to our Assist scheme
(which provides bill discounts) at first point of contact

* introduced a new care leavers scheme pilot, enabling those
leaving care to automatically access Assist up to the age of 21

* promoted our schemes using a variety of communication
channels, using imagery and wording customers have said will
best encourage them to get in touch. Our activities included:
placing adverts in specialist publications (such as hospital
magazines and with Kidney Care UK) as well as in more general
publications and locations; distributing leaflets through

schools and in ‘new parent packs’ in Chippenham; and posting
on social media, including during ‘Stop Loan Shark Week’

* committed to working with debt advice organisation Money
Wellness to refer our customers to them directly through a
web portal. With consent, we are also able to receive data back
to support customers to access the right help for them

© provided 20+ training and awareness-raising sessions with
Partners about what tap has to offer

Wider vulnerability

Our strategy to help vulnerable customers, Every Customer
Matters, continues to guide our work on providing inclusive
services, including Priority Services. Mirroring our focus on fast
and easy access to financial help, we also focused on raising
awareness and take-up of the support we offer, to those in other
types of vulnerable circumstances.

With over 100,000 customers on our register, we achieved a

on complaints.

In 2023, we registered 3,278 complaints, a 19% increase on last
year. However, we remain committed to implementing all the
improvements outlined in our best practice Complaints Action
Plan, which should result in a decrease in complaints next year.

Two water companies have experienced cyber attacks in

recent years and cyber security is a pressing issue for all critical
infrastructure providers. We are making good progress across a
range of areas that are collectively increasing our cyber defences
to safeguard our customers and the operation of the business.

Building stronger communities

We have an extensive community engagement programme and
we nurture a wide range of local groups, projects and initiatives
as part of our responsible business ethos. Our focus in working
with our communities is to make a valued contribution to people
and places, be it through funding, volunteering, the provision of
amenities, or other ways of helping communities achieve their

goals. As part of this, we try to increase understanding of how the

water system works and develop stronger relationships so we can
work with communities on shared challenges and priorities.

Community Connectors

We are now approaching the end of an innovative, two-year,
place-based engagement pilot, Community Connectors, which we
launched in April 2022, We selected the areas of Chippenham and
Bridport and worked with residents to identify shared goals that
we could work together to achieve.

Two stand-out themes emerged: climate change and the cost
of living. Throughout 2023, the Community Connectors team
pursued ways to support the shared goals through funding
relevant grass roots projects and leading on initiatives such as
Rainsavers, which involved installing water butts, rain gardens
and soaker hoses for customers.

CASE STUDY

In Chippenham, we expanded our regular Home Check water
efficiency visits to offer free water butts and trial the use of
‘soaker hoses’ to keep rainfall in gardens and out of the sewer
system. The service was popular with customers with nearly
300 households having water butts fitted. The soaker hoses
allow the captured rainwater to be automatically drained down,
into borders and vegetable beds but unfortunately only 11%

of the properties had gardens and pathways suitable for their
installation. Whilst this trial therefore had only a modest impact

on reducing rainfall into sewers it has helped to further our
understanding of customers’ appetite, motivations and the
practical barriers for such interventions,

Our engagement work of this kind continues and we are
currently trialling alternatives to water butts and soaker hoses
with residents in Chard and a coastal village in Dorset. These
pilots are also seeking to encourage customer participation in
better rainwater management at a household level as part of
a portfolio of local solutions to reduce the operation of storm
overflows and flooding incidents.

Chippenham Refill Point launch

The project concluded at the end of April 2024. We intend

to produce a final report on the trial in mid 2024 and award
‘Watermark’ accreditation to recognise environmental and water
saving achievements where agreed goals are reached.

Charity and volunteering

Our volunteering programme, Water Force, is thriving. In 2023,
760 colleagues - 30% of the Wessex Water workforce - took part,
donating over 4,000 hours with 33 different organisations.

The charitable Wessex Water Foundation, set up in 2020,
continued to provide much-needed financial support to south-
west social and environmental initiatives, in partnership with the
Somerset, Wiltshire, Dorset and Quartet Community Foundations.

In 2023-24, grants totalling £567,898 were distributed through
the Foundation to support core debt advice services provided

by Citizens Advice and our five key environmental partner
programmes, as well as through two community funding rounds
supporting grassroots environmental and community activities.

Wellbeing and recreation

We completed our refill point programme - providing free drinking
water for people on the go - with the installation of the 24th and
final refill unit in Chippenham High Street. In partnership with
local councils, we maintain and promote these refill points, saving
around 350,000 500m! single-use plastic bottles every year.

We also promoted the ‘refill not landfill’ message at events
throughout the year, providing water stations and refill points at
two Bath half marathons, the Corsham 10K and Cancer Research
UK's Race for Life. We eliminated the equivalent of 52,800 single-
use plastic bottles from landfill, engaged with more than 3,400
Customers and supported over 27,600 runners and attendees.

We are also keen to provide access, information and a great
experience at our own reservoir and recreation sites. We host
thousands of visitors every year, including many educational events
during school holidays. We have also recently completed work to
improve signage and information for visitors.

Artificial Intelligence (Al) is helping us monitor and protect the
waterways in our region.

Coastal and river water quality is affected by numerous sources - including wildlife,
agriculture, regulated storm overflows and treated sewage discharges - so we
developed an Al app with UnifAl Technology which uses algorithms to give
half-hourly predictions on bacteria levels.

As well as bacteria, the app shows the temperature, water level and water flow along
with the amount of rainfall.

At Warleigh Weir, a popular wild swimming location near Bath, data has been
collected from sensors since 2021 and swimmers now have better information
before they enter the water.

In Dorset, real-time monitoring at Bournemouth and Boscombe beaches will provide
a better understanding of water quality status. The area's bathing waters are
already assessed by the Environment Agency and most are rated ‘Excellent’, including
Bournemouth Pier, Durley Chine and Alum Chine.

UnifAl has also developed an Al system in Poole Harbour, with real-time water quality
Notifications informing local fishery and recreational businesses.

Sewer detectives

Below ground, we have been harnessing the power of Al to help spot problems in our
35,000km network of sewer pipes in partnership with research and development
firm Molfar.

We previously surveyed around 400km of sewer a year using CCTV equipment
relying on colleagues manually recording any defects they spot while watching the
footage live. Al technology automatically detects and classifies defects from survey
footage to help us improve efficiency and reduce business costs.

We are also using Al monitoring devices to detect levels in sewer pipes and trigger an
alarm when storm overflows are in use. High sewer levels can be caused by blockages
like flushed wet wipes, so we partnered with Al service StormHarvester to identify
these early before the network becomes overwhelmed. StormHarvester uses
machine learning and hyperlocal rainfall forecasts to predict sewer levels and detect
early blockage formations.

Overview

We are playing a key role in shaping thinking on how to ensure that investment targeted at improving the
environment in the widest sense represents optimal value for money in future. We have formed a coalition with
environmental groups and stakeholders that interact with or otherwise have an interest in the water environment,
to champion catchment level solutions to deliver better outcomes for nature. This promises to be an important and
exciting strand of work - see case study: Sustainable Solutions for Water And Nature (SSWAN) on page 7.

in terms of our performance, in contrast to 2022, we performed highly on environmental and leakage reduction
in 2023. We achieved a four-star Environmental Performance Assessment rating from the Environment Agency,
having responded with urgency to every potential pollution incident to do our utmost to prevent it becoming
serious, and on leakage, we reduced our annual average level by 1.4MI/d.

We head into summer 2024 with our reservoirs and aquifers in very healthy condition and do not anticipate any
supply challenges in the year ahead. However, our storm overflow discharge performance deteriorated significantly
and we registered a rise in minor pollutions. All our storm overflows are now monitored and the data will inform how
we work to eliminate spills. Our immediate priority is to tackle the most frequent spillers, as in the case of one near
Bath RFC's ground - see Protecting the River Avon in Bath on page 29.

Looking to the longer term, we published a revised Water Resources Management Plan to 2050, featuring ambitious
plans to abstract less by cutting demand. We further reduced our annual gross greenhouse gas emissions and stand
by our commitment to be carbon neutral in our operations by 2030. We exceeded our target to boost biodiversity on
Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI).

Our journey
In our Strategic Direction Statement, which sets out our aims for 2050, we are targeting:

* never harming the health of the water environment through our abstraction
* restoring the quality of our rivers and coastal waters

* being anet zero carbon business (by 2040)

+ doubling our contribution to the region's biodiversity.

In the following pages, we set out how we have performed against our current regulatory performance
commitments for enhancing the environment.

In 2022, we recorded five serious pollution incidents, but in 2023
this fell to one. We are delighted to receive the four-star rating in
the Environment Agency's Environmental Performance Assessment
(EPA) this year.

However, our total number of pollutions rose again, from 110 in
2022 to 126. Normalised by the agreed Environment Agency sewer
length of 34,944 kms, the performance level is 36.06 incidents per
10,000 km. There was an increase in events at monitored assets:
water recycling centres and strategic pumping stations. Most of
these pollution events were very minor or had a short-lived impact.

The wet weather was one causal factor for the higher number;
another was increased monitoring. Most notably, we completed the
roll-out of Event Duration Monitors (EDM) across all our 1,300 storm
overflows, so 100% are now monitored, up from 91% in 2022.

We remain committed to reducing pollution incidents, following our
Pollution Incident Reduction Plan (PIRP) and have bolstered our
focus on monitored assets considering increased incident numbers.
However, we do not expect numbers to return to historical
performance levels without further investment.

We prioritise transparency and take ownership of events when they
occur. This is clear from the fact that we self-reported 100% of
pollutions at monitored assets and 94% overall, up on 97%

and 92% respectively. We anticipate achieving green status in the
EPA in this area.

Storm overflows

In common with the whole water industry, the number of hours our
storm overflows discharged in 2023 was high compared to previous
years. In reporting EDM data nationally, the Environment Agency
noted that 2023 was an exceptionally wet year.

The monitoring data from the Environment Agency's Catchment
Data Explorer shows storm overflows contribute just 0.8% -

nine out of 1,160 - of the reasons why rivers in our area are not
achieving good ecological status. Nonetheless, in response to public
concern and political guidance, we have committed to eliminating
all ecological harm from storm overflow discharges by 2050.

Under the Water Industry National Environmental Programme
(WINEP) we are improving 13 frequently spilling storm overflows
by 2025.

Our storm overflow performance commitment relates to additional
schemes outside of WINEP commitments. We did not deliver any
extra outputs in 2023-24, but are aiming to deliver two significant
additional schemes by 2025. We have also submitted a business
plan to improve a further 128 (the most frequently spilling

or highest impact) storm overflows by 2030 in line with new
government requirements, as shown on this map: ArcGIS Storm
overflow dashboards. Planned investment to 2050 can

be viewed on this nationally collated plan National Storm.
Overflows Plan.

In terms of solutions, our preference is to prevent rainwater from
entering combined sewers, but often storage solutions have the
highest cost benefit and are more certain to achieve the required
reduction in discharges. We are also eager to use nature-based
solutions to treat highly diluted discharges caused by groundwater
infiltration into our sewer network,

Many of our most frequent spilling and longest lasting storm
overflows are found in groundwater catchments.

When groundwater levels are high, hydraulic pressure can
cause water to enter through tiny cracks in the network,
overwhelming its capacity and causing it to overflow. The
discharge, largely groundwater, is often cleaner than the river
that receives it, but this is still counted as a spill.

We can use innovative relining techniques to help prevent
infiltration on the c30% of pipes that we own, but we have
no power over the remaining 70% of the network, owned by
householders and businesses.

The risk of sewer flooding in a storm measure relates to our
understanding of flood risk in our region. We can use this
knowledge to develop strategies to reduce the risk of sewer
flooding over the long term. As in 2022, the percentage of the
population at risk in 2023 was lower than our target, reflecting
improvements in our understanding of where the risk is greatest.
This understanding helps us target action where it is most
needed.

It would be inappropriate in terms of impact on bills and
environmental consequences to build expensive, carbon-
intensive storage and treatment solutions for such highly
diluted wastewater. Our approach, which we will deliver

at 36 of our 128 overflow schemes targeted for the next
price review period, is to build wetlands to treat discharges
from groundwater-induced overflows before they reach the
watercourse.

Wetlands at Cromhall, South
Gloucestershire.

This is a much cheaper, low impact option that also has
many positive benefits for biodiversity and, potentially, for
community amenity and wellbeing.

Groundwater-induced storm overflows should be reclassified as
permitted treated discharges. That would eliminate untreated
discharges and reduce our overall numbers by around 25%.

Water resources planning

Following consultation with the public and Defra, we published

an ambitious revised draft Water Resources Management Plan in
spring 2024. This targets cutting demand sufficiently to reduce
abstraction from the environment by 20% by 2037-38 in our most
vulnerable catchments, including the Hampshire Avon. We intend
to use a combination of water efficiency visits, smart metering and
strategies to stem leakage.

We also propose to invest in a number of new supply side
schemes, including new transfers to move water to where it is
needed in our supply area and beyond. We are collaborating with
our neighbouring water companies to develop three strategic
regional water resource options, which continue to make progress

Emissions and energy performance

We report two sets of greenhouse gas emissions data. For our
performance commitment, we use a bespoke method agreed
with Ofwat at the 2019 Price Review. For other annual reporting,
including the annual performance review, we include a larger
inventory of items, in common with other water companies.

Regarding our performance commitment, although our gross
greenhouse gas emissions were up slightly on the year at 105

of UK grid electricity has led to steadily falling emissions over the

Our electricity use, at 268 gigawatt hours, was high in the
context of the last five years, in part due to the very wet weather
experienced from July onwards. We continue to pursue energy
efficiency opportunities to offset rising energy use. This is driven
by tighter water and sewage treatment standards and the
operation of our regional water supply grid.

This year we generated 17GWh of renewable energy and exported

Decarbonisation plans: 2030 and 2040
in 2019, the water industry collectively committed to achieve net
zero operational emissions by 2030. Whilst some companies have
backed away from this pledge considering developments since,
we remain steadfast in our determination to decarbonise our
operations by the end of the decade. Our net zero carbon
routemap sets out our plan, route map to net zero carbon

and we also proposed a suite of interventions for
2025-30 in our 2024 periodic review submission.

We continue to pursue well-established methods, including
advancing our energy efficiency, increasing our use of renewable
energy, decarbonising our fleet and pursuing nature-based

in preference to asset-based solutions. We also continue to
collaborate with the wider water sector on the thorny problem
of combating emissions of methane and nitrous oxide from
treatment processes. We have been trialling measurement
methods during 2023-24.

By 2040, 10 years ahead of the UK government target, we aim for
our entire business to be net zero total carbon. This will include
the embodied carbon associated with construction materials,
treatment chemicals and other products that we consume. We are
adopting tools that provide detailed estimates of the whole life
carbon of capital schemes to assist our decision making on the
lowest carbon options, including for our business plan for
2025-30.

oO} CASE STUDY PROUECTING THE RIVER AVON IN BAut)

Our £1.3 million project in the east of Bath is helping to safeguard local homes and
businesses from flooding by easing pressure on the sewer system,

Understanding the problem

Storm overflows are designed as relief valves to protect homes from flooding if
there is too much rainfall in the system, and automatically discharge into
watercourses. We are committed to eliminating the discharge of untreated
sewage, Starting with the storm overflows that discharge most frequently and
those that have environmental impact.

The overflow near Bath RFC’s rugby ground, just off London Road in Lambridge,
was identified as one of the 13 most frequently discharging in our region.

What action did we take?

Anew below-ground storm tank, capable of holding 125,000 litres of storm water,
has been installed in the car park of Bath RFC’s rugby ground at Lambridge. A
five-month project, completed in December 2023, the tank will fill when the
combined sewer system is under pressure.

It is expected to reduce discharges into the River Avon by up to three-quarters,
while preventing flooding of nearby properties.

The tank then gradually returns the water to the sewer system for onward travel
toawater recycling centre to be treated and safely returned to the environment.

As well as keeping nearby Lambridge residents informed about this project, we
worked closely with Bath RFC to ensure they could still use their rugby ground
during the construction work.

How else are we tackling storm overflows?

The project is one of 13 investment schemes we are prioritising between now and
2025 to tackle the overflows in the region that previously discharged most
frequently.

We are also tackling storm overflows in other ways, including upgrading sewage
treatment to increase capacity at 42 of our water recycling centres, and
introducing more nature-based and low-carbon treatment methods such as
reedbeds and wetlands.

Increased investigation and monitoring of overflows in the region, as well as an
extensive programme of sewer relining to help keep wastewater within the
system and prevent infiltration of groundwater that can lead to flooding, is also
continuing.

In total, nearly 100 improvement projects relating to the discharge of untreated
water are being completed in our region between 2020 and 2025, part of a£3
million a month investment to reduce the number of hours storm overflows
operate by around 25%. This case study focuses on one of a number of projects
designed to protect the River Avon and neighbouring communities.

However, we are looking to go much further and have unveiled proposals to invest
arecord £400 million on reducing overflow operation in the next five-year
investment period between 2025 and 2030, subject to approval by industry
regulators.


OE PIT SedIAag sa}eny XASsony,

We have completed a £50 million project at Durleigh water treatment centre to
Provide an improved water supply to customers in the Bridgwater area.

Refurbishment of the Enmore Road site began in 2019 after more than four years
of planning. The project involved reconstructing the old water treatment centre
- which treats water from Durleigh Reservoir to the west - to ensure that the
highest quality drinking water continues to be delivered to a population of more
than 44,000.

Brought into supply in the autumn of 2022, it is the largest single-value project
ever delivered by our engineering and sustainable delivery (ESD) team. The
three-year rebuild came in on time, despite additional challenges posed by
Covid-19.

Why did we carry out the scheme?

The 30-year old site treats up to 30 megalitres a day of water drawn from the
reservoir, but had outgrown its design capacity.

Reconstruction was needed to update the water treatment processes and ensure
it would continue to meet increasing demands from a rising population, reduce
high operating costs and tackle poor raw water quality. There were high levels of
algae during the summer and the water was often cloudy and murky in winter -
deterioration was evident over the past 20 years.

What improvements did we make?

More than 70% of the old water treatment centre was demolished and recycled,
with outdated equipment decommissioned and removed, while the rest of the site
was repurposed or refurbished.

Two new wetlands were created upstream from the centre which will improve the
quality of water entering the reservoir and enhance wildlife and biodiversity,
supporting the work we do with local farmers to reduce pesticides and silt
entering Durleigh Brook.

How did we make savings?

By using innovative developments in technology and project delivery, we made
sure the scheme’s impact on the environment was reduced, as well as saving time,
money and materials.

We partnered with infrastructure consulting firm AECOM, which delivered the
detailed design. They established that some large structures and tanks could be
built offsite and craned into position, saving an estimated 20% of programme
time and £1.1 million, as well as reducing construction waste on site by up to 20%.

The success of the Durleigh project has resulted in the creation of a dedicated
Wessex Water off-site build department, at which equipment can be designed,
manufactured and supplied pre-assembled, reducing labour, our carbon footprint
andcosts.

Working with the community

Completing such a large reconstruction inevitably affected nearby communities
and we worked closely with Durleigh Parish Council to ensure they were kept
informed about the progress of the scheme. We marked this close working
relationship by donating a £6,000 defibrillator to the village and installing it at the
entrance to the refurbished water treatment centre.

Overview

We could achieve nothing without our people and we do everything in our power to ensure everyone feels
valued, welcomed, respected and rewarded. Along with our most important imperative, to ensure our people are
safe at work, we are also committed to and are focused on ensuring a Wessex Water culture that supports the
diversity and inclusion of all who work at the company.

Along with the wider industry, we have a long way to go to be able to say our team truly reflects the communities
we serve, but we are making progress. To supplement our existing programmes on gender, race, sexuality and
disability, in 2023 we started measuring how well we are championing social mobility and took steps to support
and welcome neurodiversity in the business.

Our executive sponsorship programme for diversity and inclusion has been well received and we are taking
simple, practical measures to advance the agenda where we can. One good example is that we changed how we
advertise our jobs, to boost accessibility and inclusivity.

More broadly, we significantly expanded our careers team in 2023 and offered more places on more schemes

to more people than in 2022. This spanned early careers and career progression. We are acutely aware of the
negative public narrative about the wider water sector and recognise the risk this poses for recruitment. We are
working to reach out wherever possible to build our workforce as we head towards the next regulatory period.

Three years after the tragic incident at Avonmouth, we continue to develop our process safety capability across
all our sites and ensure it is intrinsic to everything we do. We are reassured by evidence that indicates we are
building an increasingly mature culture of engagement on safety issues. We recorded a 44% increase in safety
observations compared to 2022 and employee engagement increased by 19%. This is producing tangible
benefits for us as well as our teams; we had 65% fewer days related to lost time incidents in the year. We also
invested in training and systems to support process safety.

Our journey
Empowering our people to bring their whole selves to work and excel is an ongoing priority. We achieve this by:

« keeping everyone informed of our achievements and top priorities through newsletter communications

° delivering a quarterly leadership forum to cascade messages from the top and work together on our
challenges and priorities

* ensuring everyone receives regular ‘check-ins’, where we discuss wellbeing, communicate objectives and
provide guidance and support for all

* developing everyone through a range of mandatory and optional training solutions; providing coaching and
mentoring; and offering a vast range of apprenticeship opportunities and professional development.

supports the diversity and
inclusion of all who work at
the company.

Health and safety - reporting and culture

Performance against the Occupational Health & Safety (OHS)
strategy is monitored by our Health and Safety Steering Group
and overseen by the Health and Safety Board Committee.

We appointed a process safety director and additional process
safety engineers to support our major hazard sites and to
further develop our process safety management systems.

We continue to provide high levels of training and to ensure
our Staff are competent in all aspects necessary to keep our
facilities operating safely and efficiently.

We have made progress in 2023 to actively encourage
safety-related reporting and transparency. We recorded a
44% increase in safety observations compared to 2022 and
employee engagement increased by 19%. Our increasingly
mature culture of engagement is showing tangible benefits;
we lost 65% fewer days related to lost time incidents in

the year, reflecting both a smaller number of incidents and
reduced severity when incidents occurred.

We have broadened how we use Engage, our dedicated
health and safety reporting platform, to also capture human
influences relating to behaviours as part of root cause analysis
investigations and ‘Make It Right’ reviews. This is helping

us to understand how human factors influence unwanted
outcomes.

We have also developed enhanced safety performance reports
to meet the specific requirements for each business area,
supporting improved safety.

In terms of providing better support for the OHS professionals
within our teams, in 2023 we took actions including: providing
additional training; redefining some geographic locations to
increase efficiency; recruiting OHS apprentices; revising some
roles; and unifying accountability between operational and
construction activities.

More broadly, we developed a new mandatory ‘first day/first
week/first month’ new starter induction module in our iLearn
system and developed health and safety campaigns targeting
leading OHS issues as identified by safety data trends. These
campaigns involved communicating key messages and

preventative measures across a variety of media and formats
to suit all learning preferences.

Organisation and leadership
We completed 3,273 safety audits, an 8% increase compared
to2022.

Among other activities, we revised an OHS framework
mechanism for health and safety strategic meetings to
improve engagement, support and intervention, We also
adapted our OHS practices in line with business restructures,
including a ‘rebrand’ of our health and safety advisers to
health and safety partners (HSP) which reflects their role and
engagement more appropriately.

Awards and accreditations

We retained both our ISO 45001 certification and our Royal
Society for the Prevention of Accidents’ President's Award - an
award reserved for organisations which have achieved 10 or
more consecutive gold awards. This year we were awarded our
12th gold.

Skills, knowledge and opportunity

We have broadened our approach to careers programmes,
replacing our former ‘early careers’ focus with a broader
careers focus, delivered by a larger team.

In 2023, we took on 31 graduates (up from 13 in 2022) and

61 apprentices (up from 48) - with apprenticeships now also
available to existing members of staff (27 enrolled). We hosted
49 work experience placements and 31 industrial placements
(up from 13). We have also employed a ‘career inspiration
adviser’ to go into schools to showcase water sector careers.

Our YTL Wessex Academy, which launched in 2022, had its
initial Ofsted monitoring visit. Ofsted reported that we have
made “reasonable progress’ so far in setting up and delivering
the five courses we run.

We also introduced new ‘Skills Bootcamps’ for our existing
staff; 64 people completed three camps covering computer
aided design, better information management and change
management.

In 2023, we took on 31

Culture, inclusion and diversity

We operate an ‘everyone belongs’ ethos and our vision is that all

Parts of the Wessex Water Group will:

* celebrate diversity and encourage inclusion

* enable everyone to take ownership and accountability through
empowerment

listen to our people's views, ideas and concerns and act on
them
reject any form of discrimination or bias

* reflect the diversity of the communities we serve.

We work continually to reach and uphold these standards but
recognise we have a lot of improvements to make.

In terms of workforce diversity, compared to our peers (as
benchmarked against Energy & Utility Skills data) we outperform
on LGBTQ+ representation and meet averages regarding disability,
but underperform on both ethnicity and gender. We also appreciate
we need to go well beyond utility sector averages as regards all
characteristics.

We continue to work to that end. In 2023, in addition to our
existing Race at Work group and Disability Working Group - both
of which have developed action plans that we are implementing -
we worked on supporting neurodiverse employees and attracting
neurodiverse talent, as well as focusing for the first time on social
mobility, We have developed three metrics to boost opportunities
for employees from disadvantaged postcode areas: the number of
people recruited; the number of promotions; and the number who
complete Level 5, 6 or 7 qualifications each year.

As wellas formal activities, we are working to develop a more
inclusive atmosphere where everyone feels welcome. For instance,
in March we invited our people to attend a dinner to learn more
about Ramadan and partake in Iftar, the meal Muslims eat at
sunset every day during the holy month to break the fast.

Meanwhile, the activities of many of our existing internal networks
made progress. For instance, our Menopause Network grew

from its launch in 2022 and our ARC Alliance developed LGBTQ+
awareness material for employees and managers.

More generally, we hosted a successful Culture, Inclusion and
Diversity (CID) Week in September 2023; provided CID awareness
training to 659 colleagues; changed our job adverts to improve

inclusivity and accessibility; and continued with our programme of
executive level sponsorship for each of the main characteristics to
demonstrate leadership commitment to improving diversity and
inclusion.

Looking to 2024, our CID Working Group will review our CID
awareness sessions and update the content, including social
mobility topics.

We will continue to use Energy & Utility Skills data to inform our
initiatives and are developing an internal communications plan to
keep colleagues informed on progress in this important area. We
want to encourage staff to share sensitive data so our activities
are well informed.

We also have a number of important gender-related initiatives

in the pipeline for 2024. We have launched a Women's Network
across the Group to help attract, develop and retain female
colleagues and we plan to join the wider sectors Women’s Utility
Network to gain access to more resources and ideas.

During 2023, we launched a new recruitment platform and
rebuilt our careers pages to showcase our diverse range of
opportunities to communities. This has enabled us to provide
our applicants with a more engaging ‘one-click’ journey when
applying for jobs with us and enabled them to track their
progress though their own careers portal. They can also view
opportunities right across the UK group of companies.

Our hiring managers can easily navigate their recruitment
campaigns, accessing talent through their mobile devices and
responding to applicants swiftly to keep them engaged. Our
in-house recruitment team can analyse where applicants come
from and tailor campaigns according to the most effective
method.

Since launching this new system in October 2023, we have seen
a significant improvement in the quality of talent, reduced our
time to hire by up to four weeks, improved both applicant and
management engagement and reduced expenditure on both
the use of recruitment agencies and non-effective advertising
channels.

Our long-term plan for delivery is set out in our Strategic Direction Statement, published on
our website here. The statement, which was developed in partnership with customers,
businesses, employees and stakeholders, sets out our vision and ambitions though to 2050.
It is structured around eight ‘outcomes’ — eight fundamental results we plan to achieve through
our actions. These are:

* safe and reliable water supply

* an effective sewerage system

* affordable bills

* excellent customer experience

* sustainable abstraction

* excellent river and coastal water quality
* net zero carbon

« increased biodiversity.

These outcomes are underpinned by six enablers that will help us achieve the results we strive
for:

e Individual safety, wellbeing and engagement: our colleagues will be safe at work,
. proud to work for us and fully engaged in their roles

¢ Skills, knowledge and opportunity: our colleagues will have the skills and knowledge
they need and be empowered to carry out their roles

e Culture, inclusion and diversity: we will have an inclusive workforce that reflects the
cultures and diversity of the region we serve

e Well managed, open, ethical and transparent: we will prove that we are honest and
ethical in the way we conduct our business.

¢ Resilient financial stewardship: we will demonstrate long-term financial stability

e Market-led outcomes: we will harness the power of markets to drive the most efficient
solutions

Financing the future

To be a trusted, financially strong company with fair investor retums
Overview

Although inflation has fallen throughout the year, we continued to feel its impact through higher
energy and payroll costs and raised interest rates. This affected our financial performance in
the year. However, our liquidity remains healthy and combined with YTL Group’s continued
investment, our financial foundations remain strong, allowing us to invest for the future. In fact, .
we boosted our capital investment by over 40% in 2023.

Seeking alternative approaches to traditional capital investment will be more important than
ever as we transition into the next price review period. We are proposing to double our current
level of investment and will have new obligations to deliver, including ambitious phosphorus
reduction targets. The step change in investment brings with it delivery challenges. We are
now planning the scale-up of our delivery capability. These changes take place against a
backdrop of growing risk and in part contribute to it. We remain vigilant and responsive to
identifying, communicating and managing material business risks.

The Wessex Water Marketplace — a platform through which we share our challenges and data
with the open market and invite others to compete to help us deliver solutions — celebrated its
fifth anniversary in the year. We have seen some real benefits from the approach, including
this year implementing an Al-enabled CCTV solution that means we can survey twice as much
sewer length in any given time. The Marketplace and our other ongoing activities such as our
expanding use of nutrient markets, demonstrates our commitment to competition, facilitating
new ideas and working collaboratively on innovative solutions.

In this way, we seek to drive down costs, protect our assets, reduce our carbon footprint and
ensure business resilience. We were awarded strong scores on our environmental, social and
governance practices from two external assessors this year: Sustainalytics and Sustainable
Fitch.

We also published our first Sustainable Finance Allocation and Impact Report, which provides
information for investors on the allocation of our inaugural £300m sustainability bond which
was issued in March 2023.

Our joumey

We always aim to exhibit exemplary governance, transparency, accountability, efficiency and
financial resilience. YTL has now owned Wessex Water for over 20 years, making it one of the
longest single owners of a UK water and sewerage company. We have a simple financial
structure and do not engage in any aggressive or artificial tax planning.

YTL stands ready to invest into Wessex Water, for a fair return, to help finance the much
enlarged investment programme. Building on this, in our strategic direction statement to 2050
we have committed to:

e being the most efficient water company in the industry — harnessing the power of
markets and real competition and championing an outcomes-based approach to
regulation where efficiency can be maximised through flexibility and choice

Corporate Structure

The UK group structure has remained the same since 2002 with the company wholly owned
by Wessex Water Limited, which in turn is wholly owned by YTL Utilities (UK) Limited. Further
details of the overall group structure can be found on page 68.

There is no intragroup funding to the Company, :all debt is raised by the Company at market
rates and is provided by external third parties.

Overall performance

We recorded a loss in the year, driven by high operating and interest costs, partly offset by
higher prices allowed by Ofwat from April 2023.

The higher operating costs related principally to exposure to energy market prices, new
obligations and other inflationary pressures, including a new pay deal for our colleagues. The
increase in interest costs related to the indexation features of our bond portfolio in particular.

We successfully placed £200m of private placement bonds in November 2023.

Sustainable Finance Framework

Our Sustainable Finance Framework, which supports our financing ambitions to deliver
tangible environmental and social benefits, was originally published in September 2022 and
has recently been refreshed to incorporate latest practice. The framework aligns our purpose
— to support our customers’ health and wellbeing, and enhance the environment and the
diverse communities we serve — and our business plan commitments to our financing
ambitions through the use of targeted financing.

Under the framework, we may issue environmental or social debt instruments to support our
environmental and social objectives, enabling investors to participate in the provision of a
sustainable future. Wessex Water's ability to create value for all stakeholders in a sustainable
manner is core to our beliefs.

We need certainty to remain attractive for private investment and to plan for the future. We will
continue to ensure customers’ bills are affordable whilst investing in our infrastructure,
protecting the environment and innovating to find the best, cost-effective solutions.

Our commitment to delivering a better future will allow our investors to participate in funding
our provision of water and wastewater services on a sustainable basis, helping to contribute
to global climate change targets and the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals.

We will make sure that where we can, we implement nature-based solutions and explore new
ways to drive down costs, protect our assets, reduce our carbon footprint and ensure business
resilience.

We will continue to be one of the top performing water companies to secure future investment
at an efficient cost.

Financing

The company’s liquidity position comprises cash and cash equivalents held on the balance
sheet along with undrawn bank facilities,. giving the company instant access to funding if
needed. We invest cash in deposits with highly rated banks which are regularly reviewed.

private placement bonds with a combined value of £200m, maturities of 10-20 years and a
coupon of 6.50%. The net proceeds from the issue of these bonds were loaned to Wessex
Water to fund its investment programme and repay £100m of European Investment Bank term
loans due in January & March 2024.

Total borrowings, including amounts owed to subsidiary companies, were £3,089.0m as of

with a view, when declaring dividends, to protect the Company's existing credit ratings. The
Board remains committed to maintaining investment grade credit ratings for the Company at
all times.

Dividends

For the 2024 financial year the Board considered a number of factors prior to approval of
dividends including performance for customers and the environment, financing out-
performance, and the ability to maintain financial resilience in line with the review of long-term
viability.

Performance highlights for 2024 included the company looking set to return to four-star for the
EA’s Environmental Performance Assessment (EPA), being the highest ranked water and
sewerage company for Ofwat's customer measure of experience (C-Mex) and potential best
in industry performance under the DWI’s Compliance Risk Index (CRI) measure. The company
also increased asset investment in the year by over 40% to its highest level since privatisation.

During the year we declared dividends of £66.5m representing a yield of 5.0% on the
company’s regulatory equity.
Credit ratings

Wessex Water and its financing subsidiary have credit ratings assigned by two ratings
agencies. These provide an external view on creditworthiness for our debt investors. The latest
published ratings are as follows:

Credit rating agency Rating Outlook _—_ Date of Publication

Fitch BBB+ Stable November 2023
Moody’s Baat Stable January 2024
Pensions

The latest actuarial valuation of the Company’s pension scheme took place on 30 September
2022, showing a funding deficit of £35.3m. The Company has agreed with the scheme’s
trustees a payment recovery plan in respect of the deficit comprising employer contributions
of 15.5% and special contributions over the following two years to reduce the deficit. The
Company paid a special contribution of £18.4m on 30 June 2023 which, along with investment
returns from return-seeking assets, has made good the shortfall. The next funding valuation
is due no later than 30 September 2025, at which progress towards full-funding will be
reviewed.

Environmental, Social and Governance score

In June 2022, Sustainalytics provided our first ESG rating: a low-risk score of 18.5. In October
2023, following Sustainalytics’ annual review, our score improved to 17.0 low-risk. This was a
result of demonstrating improvements in policy and publicly available information.

To further validate our ESG position, in February 2024 Sustainable Fitch assigned us an ESG
Entity Rating of ‘2’ (good ESG profile) and an entity score of 73 (higher is better). Fitch's
summary stated: “The rating reflects Wessex Water's overall strong ESG profile and the
broadly positive environmental and social impact of its business activities, of providing water
and wastewater services.” We are keen to test our credentials with third-party ESG ratings as
the process provided good learning points regarding policies, reporting and transparency of
information that we provide externally.

Tax strategy
Our attitude towards UK tax planning

Our approach to tax is fully aligned with our overall objectives. We seek to comply with the
spirit and letter of UK tax legislation and claim all tax reliefs and allowances to which we are
entitled. We will consider reasonable tax planning opportunities which are in line with our risk
appetite. As a rule, we do not enter into complicated structures nor engage in any aggressive
or artificial tax planning, because we do not believe it is the correct thing to do. Due to the size
and complexity of the UK tax system, tax is a complicated area and uncertainties will arise.
Consistent with other business areas, we will seek external advice when required.

Approach to risk management and governance arrangements in relation to UK tax

The Board is ultimately responsible for our tax strategy and engages with relevant individuals
within the Company to ensure the strategy is implemented, monitored, and reported. As a UK
regulated business with a significant capital programme, we believe obtaining tax relief on
capital expenditure is a key factor affecting our tax liability. Other factors, such as changes in
tax legislation or changes in interpretations, may also affect the amount of tax due, compared
with what has been allowed as part of the regulatory final determination.

The level of risk in relation to UK tax the company is prepared to accept

As documented in our finance policy, we adopt a risk-averse and cautious approach to tax. In
addition, tax is included as part of our risk assessment framework. We monitor the overall risk
framework and provide regular updates to the Board.

The company approach towards dealings with HMRC

We have an open, regular, and professional dialogue with HMRC and, as part of its business
risk reviews, HMRC have always regarded our Company as low risk. We are committed to
maintaining this low-risk status in the long term and believe that our approach to tax and early
engagement with HMRC on any area of uncertainty are significant factors in maintaining this
low-risk rating. We will also engage with HMRC on industry-wide matters through our
membership of Water UK. ,

Our total tax contribution

We are committed to paying the right amount of tax at the right time. We pay a range of
taxes, including business rates, employers’ national insurance and environmental taxes such
as the climate change levy as well as the corporation tax showing in our tax charge on the
income statement. Following the Chancellor's confirmation that full expensing has become
permanent, our current tax liability remains nil. A breakdown of our total tax contribution is
shown below:

Section 172 Statement

Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 requires a director of a company to act in good faith,
as he or she considers will most likely promote the long-term success of the company for the
benefit of all stakeholders as a whole.

This section sets out how both the Board as a whole, and the directors as individuals, have
had regard to the matters set out in s.172(1) (a) to (f) in particular:

e the likely consequence of any decision in the long term;
e the interests of the company’s employees;

e the need to foster the company’s business relationships with suppliers, customers, and
others;

e the impact of the company’s operations on the community and the environment;

e the desirability of the company maintaining a reputation for high standards of business
conduct; and

e the need to act fairly as between members of the company.

Our Governance Report (pages 53 to 70) outlines how the Board operates and describes how
the Board has:

e established the Company's purpose, strategy, and values, and is satisfied that these
and our culture reflects the needs of ail those it serves

e taken full responsibility for all aspects of the Company's business for the long term

e demonstrated leadership and an approach to transparency and governance with trust
and accountability at its heart

e ensured the skills, experience, and composition of the Board and its overall
effectiveness meets the Company’s future requirements.

In discharging our section 172 duty, our directors, individually and collectively as the Board,
act as they consider will best promote the success of the Company, for the benefit of all our
stakeholders. As part of this duty, our directors have regard for likely long-term consequences
of decisions and the reputation of the business demonstrated through high standards of
business conduct. .

Our s172 duties have regard to our employees, our customers, and to all our external
stakeholders.

¢ Employees - the Board regards the company employees as critical to delivering the
vision, values and outcomes needed to meet our wider stakeholder expectations. The
Board has established several channels to allow employees to be heard whether to
raise concerns, make improvement suggestions or simply to appreciate how we work
with them. The People’s Council is a forum attended by representatives across our
operational business and allows employees to raise agenda items for discussion
through their representative. The Council is attended by Board Executive Directors and
meets twice a year. .

In addition, the Company undertakes an annual anonymous employee survey. The
Board debates the actions needed and progress. The Company also has employee

roadshows, Learn at Lunch sessions and an ‘Ask an Exec’ on a regular basis to
improve learning, appreciation of other departments and to share the messages from
the Board. The Board actively supports employees though mental health awareness,
disability awareness, creating an inclusive work environment, and developing and
supporting people through their careers. The Board continue to grow their established
training “Academy” to deliver apprenticeships, to address skills shortages across the
industry and in particular supporting people of all ages to develop their careers. Our
Academy entry requirements provide a fully accessible route to a career for those from
diverse and disadvantaged backgrounds.

« Customers — Our customers and the service we provide to them are fundamental to
the Board. The Board considers the impact of its actions and decisions on customers,
both for service and value for money. The Board’s aim to be a top-10 customer service
provider across all sectors; the provision of water quality in line with World Health
Organisation Standards; to have no escape of sewage or environmental harm; whilst
ensuring that customer bills are less than 5% of disposable income is embedded
throughout all decisions and actions made.

e External Stakeholders — the Board have close regard to our business relationships with
our wider stakeholders; our social purpose, sustainability, the natural environment, and
the impact of our operations on the environment and the communities we serve; as
well as the need to act fairly to balance all stakeholder needs. Consideration of these
factors and other relevant matters is embedded into all Board decision-making,
strategy development and risk assessment throughout the year.

The Board's commitment to enhancing the environment and supporting our diverse
communities is demonstrated through its Water Force Programme allowing employees
to donate their time to local charities; funding local volunteers “Water Guardians” to
assist local wildlife trusts, and funding local groups and community interest groups
through the Wessex Water Foundation to make a positive impact to the community
and improve the environment.

Our key stakeholders and how we engage with them are set out in more detail in the table on

Strategic Report

Board principal decisions

The following examples provide insight into some of the Board discussions and principal decisions
taken during the reporting year. This includes how stakeholder interests are considered, where
conflicting stakeholder requirements have been debated and how the Board and its decisions have
added long-term value to the Company. The Board’s principal! decisions are central to the formation
and delivery of our strategy and are those critical to our long-term performance and success. Details
of the Board Committees, including membership, number of meetings, and attendance are set out
in the Committee reports on pages 71 to 96. An outline of the Board members’ skills and experience
is outlined on page 62. In any decision we consider the needs and requirements of all our
stakeholder groups, cognisant that we may not be able to meet everyone’s requirements as
positively as we would like and take careful consideration of competing priorities.

Principal decision 1 — Environmental Strategy, Catchment Quality and Regulation

The Board had extensive debates during the year on the strategy to achieve our environmental
ambition and outcomes by 2050 and the regulatory framework to enable achievement of that
ambition. The Board considered the company’s current performance and position, potential solutions
for the more challenging issues and current work already being undertaken to meet long-term
ambitions. The Board invited a panel of external stakeholder experts to inform and challenge the
Board’s strategy to improve river quality, upstream sustainable catchment management solutions
and nature-based solutions. These discussions informed the Board’s environmental delivery
framework, our business plan submission and further informed our Sustainable Solutions for Water
and Nature (SSWAN) initiative to lobby for outcome-based regulation focussed on whole catchment
health.

Principal decision 2 — Business Plan Approval

’ After significant consideration, challenge and discussion the Board approved the submission of the
five-year business plan to Ofwat. In approving the submission, the Board considered the challenges
of the regulatory approach against the ambition of the business strategy and the company’s
alternative business plan. The Board reviewed the content of the business plan, evaluating the ability
to finance the plan, the scale of investment, impact on overall bili profiles, risks and uncertainties,
performance level commitments, and the deliverability of the programme. The Board considered the
impacts on:

e Customers, in terms of bills and water poverty but at the same time recognising the
unsustainably low level of water bills in the UK.

e Environmental stakeholder and community groups whose expectations are for us to do more
to protect the environment.

e Regulators, to meet the specific requirements of the price review business planning process
challenged by delivering longer-term improvements and outcomes.

e Employees, to ensure that there was sufficient capacity to deliver the programme of work.

The Board approved the plan, believing it was in the best interest of all stakeholders. However it
decided to continue to work with the regulator on an alternative planning approach to improve the
scope to deliver environmental gain and customer benefits more effectively, over a sustainable long-
term approach.

Strategic Report

Principal decision 3 — Culture, Inclusion, Diversity (CID) and the Gender Pay Gap

The Board reviewed our suite of CID and gender equality initiatives and challenged the progress
made to date. Key metrics in focus areas of gender, disability, ethnicity, and LGBTQ+ are routinely
measured across the company, supported by a new focus on social mobility, which looks at
employees living in DWP-defined disadvantaged postcodes. These measures support delivery to
our customers and enhance the diverse communities we serve. The Board considered comparative
performance across the wider utility industry and community-based data from local authorities.

The Board also reviewed the gender pay gap, which shows the difference between average hourly
pay for men and women. The Board discussed the trend, showing an improved equality position
(based on mean averages) for women from 2021 (2.6%) to 2023 (1.6%), noting the higher proportion
of male employees (77%) in the workplace. The Board was encouraged by the work being
undertaken to engage with young people, the YTL Academy and educational establishments to
encourage more women into the utility industry, particularly within the Wessex region.

The Board debated the progress made and the specifics of further improvements required based on
the performance to date and comparators. A comprehensive programme of twenty activities across
each of the CID key areas of focus was agreed along with initiatives to encourage more women into
the utility industry that address both shorter-term solutions and longer-term. The Board requested
a continued focus on CID and gender pay as a high priority as it is in the best interests of our
employees, the communities we serve and quality of service, the utility industry as a whole and the
long-term sustainability of the company.

Principal decision 4 — Dividends

The Board undertakes quarterly reviews of company performance in consideration of its dividend
payment to the shareholder. In particular, the Board reviews the operational, financial and credit
performance of the company and wider economy in assessing any dividend due, taking regard of
the expectations of customers, regulators and other environmental stakeholder groups. The Board
debated the current operational performance particularly for customer service, drinking water quality,
the environmental performance rating (EPA score), sewer flooding and leakage. The Board also
considered the proposed investment requirements required both for the short and long term and the
forecast performance for the year end, in particular the investment to recover to reduce pollutions
and flooding. In reviewing the financial performance, the Board referenced the detailed management
accounts and discussed the reduction in revenue from reduced household consumption, which was
anticipated to stabilise. The Board considered the Company’s ability to maintain a solid investment
grade credit rating together with its gearing, interest cover ratio, forecasts for inflation and other
economic pressures that may arise against that forecast and budget. In considering the potential
dividend the Board also considered any tax liabilities, pension deficits and the liquidity position.

The Board decided the dividend payment was consistent with the company performance, particularly
for service delivery, its customers, and environmental stewardship, taking into account the current
and future risk and investment requirements, reflecting the long-term commitment from the
shareholder. ;

Strategic Report

Principal decision 5 — Capital Investment Decision (Holdenhurst)

The board made a number of decisions relating to significant capital investment during the year. An
example of this is at Holdenhurst Water Recycling Centre (WRC), an activated sludge works with
UV treatment operating near the River Stour and serving a population equivalent of c176,000. It falls
within the Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council area and serves the town of Bournemouth.
The Water Recycling Centre is identified as part of the WINEP (Water Industry National Environment
Programme) as requiring process improvements to meet future regulatory obligations over
phosphorus, aluminium, storm storage and Event Duration Monitoring (EDM) on overflows to and
from storm tanks.

The Board considered the options noting the ability to maintain site operations within permits and
services to the customer during the improvements. The specific solutions presented were considered
with discussion of the risks on site, the cost commitment, the embedded and operational carbon
impacts, the increased chemical dosing and volume of sludge treatment needed, the design life and
the potential for future expansion, the permitted development with potential impacts on green belt
land, and compliance with future permitting requirements. The Board considered the scheme’s cost
of £24.6m against other competing demands and the opportunities to prioritise the improvements to
the environment for river water quality and carbon. The Board discussed the opportunities for using
power generated from other bioresources activities to be used on the site to reduce the overall
energy cost and the carbon impact. The Board considered the scheme to be in the best interests of
the environment to provide sustainable and resilient services, and its regulators.

The strategic report was approved by the Board of Directors on 20 September 2024 and signed

outlining an ambitious £3.5bn investment programme.

Maintaining the highest standards of corporate governance is integral to the long-term success of
the Company. The Company continues to embrace Ofwat's Board leadership, transparency and
governance principles and is satisfied that it meets all the objectives. The Ofwat Objectives are the

believe that our standards of corporate governance ensure that the Company operates effectively
and efficiently to the benefit of all our stakeholders, maintaining our position as a leading water and
sewerage company for customer service, satisfaction, and environmental performance. In this
report, we demonstrate and explain how this is the case.

The following pages set out details of our Board of Directors (pages 54 to 57), further information on
our governance arrangements and compliance with Ofwat’s Objectives (pages 58 to 70) and the
reports of the Audit and Risk, Environment and Public Value, Health and Safety, Nomination, and

Governance Report

Board leadership, transparency, and governance — the Ofwat Objectives (and supporting
provisions) . :

We explain below how we meet the Ofwat Objectives and supporting principles on Board
leadership, transparency and governance as published by Ofwat in January 2019.

Ofwat Objective 1 - Purpose, values, and culture

The Board establishes the company’s purpose, strategy, and values, and is satisfied that
these and its culture reflect the needs of all those it serves.

The Board has full responsibility for all aspects of the Company's business, and is responsible for
establishing the purpose, aims, strategy, values, and culture of the Company for the long term. The
Company spends time considering and reviewing its purpose, aims and strategy. This is to ensure
that the Company continues to meet the demands of all stakeholders.

The Company’s purpose is ‘To support our customers’ health and wellbeing and enhance the
environment and the diverse communities we serve’. The long-term plan for delivery of the
Company’s purpose is set out in the revised Strategic Direction Statement which can be found here
with eight key outcomes.

CENCE) | Torestore the quality of our rivers and coastal
waters:

Bea net zero carbon business by 2040

Increased brodiversity, Double our contribution to the region’s biodiversity

The purpose, aims, strategy, values, and culture of the Company are developed and promoted
through continuous engagement with wider stakeholders, including customers, community and
interest groups, employees, and regulators. The Company has mechanisms through which
stakeholder interests can be represented and changing societal pressures can be understood by the
Board, including the Customer Challenge Group, the PR24 working group, and the Environment and
Public Value Committee, the role, and responsibilities of which are described further in this report.

Additional information about the range of stakeholder engagement that has informed and influenced
the aspirations of the Board is contained in the Strategic Report on pages 2 to 52. Through this
approach the Board ensures that the Company's vision, which encompasses its purpose, values,
and culture, aims and strategy to deliver, are aligned to ensure the Company performs and delivers
for all that it serves.

The Company maintains its formal policy on business ethics. Directors and employees are expected
to commit to the highest standards of professional and ethical conduct to protect the Company's
reputation and standing. Unethical behaviour, bribery and corruption are not tolerated. All Directors
and employees are made aware of the Company's policy and that breaching it will result in
disciplinary action.

Wessex Water Services Ltd 58

Governance Report

The Board’s processes ensure that the proposals contained within the current and proposed five—
year business plans are consistent with its vision, aims and strategy for the long term. The activities
of the Board that enable it to be satisfied that the business plan is consistent with its long-term vision
for the Company are set out within the Strategic Direction Statement which is available on the
Company's website. The Company actively canvasses for longer-term Outcome Based
Environmental Regulation to enable society to pay less for more environmental improvements,
empowering the water sector to make its contribution to the Government's 25-year Environment
Plan. The Board continues to engage with the Company's regulators to encourage this more holistic
approach to regulatory performance outcomes beyond a five-year period to encourage sustained
outcomes.

Given the long-term challenges faced by society, the Board has a well-established published
statement of the Company's social purpose, and is supported by the Environment and Public Value
Committee in delivering this. This statement specifies the Company’s wider role, in particular the
opportunity to deliver a better environment, to support the communities we serve, to be a great place
to work and to contribute to the growth of the UK economy.

The Board monitors and assesses the values and culture of the business to satisfy itself that
behaviours are aligned with the Company's purpose and values on an ongoing basis. It does so by
monitoring the performance of the business against its key targets. It also seeks out the views and
experiences of customers, key stakeholders, and employees. The Board has an established
Customer Challenge Group that works with customers to help inform strategy, policy and delivery.
The Board also takes account of independent assessments of the Company's commitment to
customer service excellence by achieving both the government's Customer Service Excellence
accreditation and the Institute of Customer Service ‘Service Mark’ accreditation and Trustpilot
reviews. Key stakeholders are engaged through a variety of means from funding water guardians,
working with organisations such as Citizens Advice or liaising with over 300 partners through our
“Partner Hub”. Employees’ views are canvassed through regular surveys and by giving further
opportunities for instant feedback. Where there is evidence that behaviours are misaligned with the
Company's purpose and values, the Board acts, through the Executive and Management, to correct
this. Further details are included in the Strategic Report on pages 2 to 52.

The Company has clear values and behaviours for its employees to follow and actively publicises to
all its employees a whistleblowing (“Raising a Concern’) policy for reporting instances of wrongdoing
or inappropriate activity across all areas of business, including behaviours, water regulation, health
and safety, bribery, corruption, and fraud. All ‘Raising a Concern’ reports are treated on a strictly
confidential basis whether from internal or external sources. Issues of whistleblowing are brought to
the attention of the Audit and Risk Committee.

Ofwat Objective 2 - Standalone regulated company

The regulated company has an effective Board with full responsibility for all aspects of
the regulated company’s business for the long term.

The Board is fully focused on and has full responsibility for the activities of the Company and is
responsible and accountable for setting, implementing, and supporting the Company's purpose,
strategy, aims, values, and culture. The Board is satisfied that this objective is met, and the Board
takes full responsibility for all aspects of the Company’s business for the long term. The Board
composition and details of career backgrounds, relevant skills, Committee membership and tenure
is set out in the individual biographies on pages 54 to 57.

Governance Report

The Board sets the strategy, oversees its delivery, and maintains the highest standards of
governance. The Board also ensures that, in making its decisions, these create sustainable, long-
term value for the Company’s stakeholders. The Board has ultimate responsibility for risk
management and determines the appropriate risk appetite based on a balanced assessment of all
risks including safety, operational, financial, and strategic. The Board is supported by both the Audit
and Risk Committee and the Health and Safety Committee, from which it receives regular updates
and reports.

In order to manage risk, the Board and its Committees assess the integrity of information and
whether controls and systems of risk management are robust and defensible. The Board requires
management to identify, assess and report the impact of risks to enable the Board to effectively
monitor and approve any decisions affecting the Company’s risk profile. An explanation of principal
tisks, and our approach to mitigating these risks, is provided on pages 97 to 114.

The Chair leads the Board and ensures that all items are discussed openly and that all Directors
have the opportunity to express their views. The Board meets at least six times each year.

The principal duties of the Board and the matters reserved for its decision are fully documented and
published on the Company’s website. The Board is responsible for strategy; charges; material
changes to the Company’s management and control structure; Board appointments; approval of
material contracts; risk management; health and safety; disposal and acquisition of material assets;
approval of the annual operating budgets; employee pension arrangements; significant changes in
accounting policies; and the defence and settlement of material litigation. During the year, the Board
received detailed reports from Executive Directors on all aspects of the Company’s business and
finances. There are regular updates on health and safety, customer service, operational
performance, management of key business risks, the investment programme, and regulatory
matters. During the year, the PR24 working group spent significant time considering and reviewing
the approach and content of the business planning for AMP8.

There are no matters specifically reserved to the shareholder. In practice the Board operates (and
has operated continuously for more than a decade) without the requirement for shareholder
resolutions. As part of its responsibility for the management of risk, the Board has determined criteria
which control the extent of dividends paid and consequently the financial gearing of the Company.
As with all Board decision making, these criteria were determined with the active involvement of the
Independent Non-Executive Directors. These criteria are set out in the notes to the accounts. The
Board also annually reviews and approves the Company's framework for control of the Company's
affairs detailing the effective management of the Company and granting delegated powers and
authorisations.

In line with good governance, the Board delegates certain roles and responsibilities to its
Committees. All Board Committees report to the Board and, where required, final decisions are
taken by the Board. The Independent Non-Executive Directors, led by the Senior Independent Non-
Executive Director, form, or participate in the various Board Committees. The Committees assist
the Board by fulfilling their roles and responsibilities, focusing on specific activities, reporting to the
Board on decisions and actions taken and making recommendations to the Board. The Terms of
Reference of each of the Board Committees are regularly reviewed and published on the Company's
website. ,

The Board ensures that Directors (and in particular the Independent Non-Executive Directors) have
access to independent professional advice at the Company’s expense where they judge it necessary
to discharge their responsibilities as Directors. The Board also ensures that the Committees are
provided with sufficient resources to undertake their duties.

Wessex Water Services Ltd 60

Governance Report

if Directors have concerns about the running of the Company or a proposed action which cannot be
resolved, they are encouraged to ensure that their concerns are recorded in the Board minutes and
the Independent Non-Executive Directors are encouraged, on resignation, to provide a written
statement to the Chairman highlighting any such concerns.

The Company arranges appropriate Directors’ and Officers’ insurance against the usual legal risks
faced through holding office.

Ofwat Objective 3 - Board leadership and transparency

The Board’s leadership and approach to transparency and governance engenders trust
in the regulated company and ensures accountability for their actions.

The Board is satisfied that its leadership of the Company including its transparency and
accountability satisfies this objective.

Details of the Company’s group structure can be found on page 68. Details of the Board Committees,
including membership, number of meetings, and attendance are set out in the Committee reports on
pages 71 to 96.

The Company’s dividend policy and detail on dividends paid during the year are set out in the Notes
to the statutory financial statements on page 166. Details of the Company's executive pay policy can
be found on page 82.

The Board is also responsible for the management of risk. The principal risks to the Company and
how these have been considered and addressed can be found in the Strategic Report on pages 97
to 114.

The Company looks to ensure that it publishes information for its customers and stakeholders in a
form that is clear and easily accessible.

Ofwat Objective 4 - Board structure and effectiveness

The Boards and their Committees are competent, well run, and have sufficient
independent membership, ensuring they can make high quality decisions that address
diverse customer and stakeholder needs.

The Board is satisfied that this objective is met. .

Governance Report

The Company carefully considers its Board composition and there are currently five Independent
Non-Executive Directors on the Board. This makes the Independent Non-Executive Directors the
single largest group on the Board and ensures that wider group or shareholder interests are not able
to override independent judgment and/or dominate decision-making. The Independent Non-
Executive Directors bring extensive knowledge and experience to the Board.

In addition to the Independent Non-Executive Directors, there are four Executive Directors. The
Executive Directors have significant experience in the water sector. One experienced former
Independent Director is also appointed as a Non-Executive Director: David Barclay was our former
Senior Independent Director, and the Board makes full use of his individual professional expertise.

Four further Non-Executive Directors are appointed by the Company's sole shareholder, including
the Chair and Kathleen Chew as an alternate director for Hann Yeoh, Hong Yeoh and Mark Yeoh.

The collective experience of the Directors and the diverse skills and experience they possess

ensures that the Board makes decisions in a balanced way. The Board considers that its current
composition ensures an appropriate balance of skills, experience, independence, and knowledge so

that no individual or small group of individuals can dominate the Board’s decision taking. Details of

the Board’s skills and experience can be found in the Director's biographies on pages 54 to 57 and

are summarised below:

tofrastroctured
Castomes ce wer

Pablie
AttairsiPotiog

The Independent Non-Executive Directors scrutinise the performance of management in meeting
agreed goals and objectives and monitor the reporting of performance. The Independent Non-
Executive Directors have direct access to senior management and contact with the wider business
is always encouraged to ensure a deeper understanding of the Company's operations and activities.

The search for Board candidates is led by the Nomination Committee, and appointments and re-
appointments are made by the Board on merit, against objective criteria, with due regard to the
benefits of diversity on the Board (including diversity of skills, experience, ethnicity, and gender).
Before any formal appointment, new Independent Non-Executive Directors meet with Ofwat to
ensure that there is a clear understanding of the responsibilities attached to being a non-executive
director in this sector. All directors receive induction training on joining the Board and regularly
update and refresh their skills and knowledge, including by spending time with the business and
attending site visits. .

Wessex Water Services Ltd 62

Governance Report

Chair

Throughout the financial year under review Francis Yeoh was the Company’s Chair. The Chair was
not independent of investors on appointment; however, this appointment is considered to be
appropriate given the Company is a private company with a single shareholder. Whilst not
independent, the Chair has demonstrated objective judgment throughout his tenure, and the Board
is satisfied that the Chair leads the Board in a way that encourages all Directors to participate fully
in Board discussions. The Board and its Committees have sufficient independent membership,
ensuring they can make high quality decisions that address diverse customer and stakeholder
needs.

To ensure there is an independent link with regulators that is separate from management or the
shareholder, Jim McKenna, the Senior Independent Director, is the nominated point of contact.
Since Jim was appointed Senior Independent Director in November 2020, he has spent a significant
amount of time developing that relationship with Ofwat and other regulators.

The Chair promotes a culture of openness and debate by facilitating the effective contribution of
Non-Executive Directors, in particular ensuring constructive relations between Executive and Non-
Executive Directors and ensuring effective communication with the Company’s shareholder. Board
agendas are agreed in consultation with other Directors and the Company Secretary. By way of
exception to the general governance provisions, the Chair does not have formal meetings with Non-
Executive Directors but has informal meetings and discussions on an ongoing basis.

The Chair is responsible for ensuring that Directors receive accurate, timely and clear information.
Any Director or the Company Secretary may request an item be included on the agenda.

Senior Independent Director

Jim McKenna is the Board’s Senior Independent Director. Jim is a member of all Board Committees
and is responsible for leading the annual review of Board performance. As Senior Independent
Director, Jim would chair Board meetings if the Chair were unavailable. The Senior Independent
Director’s role is to act as a sounding board for the Chair and to serve as an intermediary for the
other Directors, when necessary, as well as an additional point of contact for the shareholder and
other stakeholders. By way of exception to general governance provisions, the performance of the
Chair is incorporated within the Board effectiveness review, rather than led by the Senior
Independent Director. The Company believes this approach, which results in a range of feedback,
provides a more robust and well-rounded performance review.

As the Senior Independent Director appointed in accordance with the Licence, Jim is well placed to
provide an independent link to Ofwat, our regulator.

Independent Non-Executive Directors

The Company’s Independent Non-Executive Directors are appointed from a range of different
backgrounds to bring to the Board an appropriate balance of skills, external experience, and
knowledge. Details of their skills and experience can be found in their biographies on pages 54 to
57 and in the Board skills matrix on page 62.

The Independent Non-Executive Directors, as the single largest group on the Board, provide
independent thought and challenge to the Board’s decision making. The Board has reviewed their
status and confirmed their independence. in particular, the Board considers these Directors to be
independent in character and judgement. The Board is not aware of any relationships or
circumstances which are likely to affect, or could appear to affect, any Independent Non-Executive
Director’s judgement.

Wessex Water Services Ltd 63

Governance Report

Independent Non-Executive Directors are appointed following a formal process led by the
Nomination Committee. Independent Non-Executive Directors are required to meet with Ofwat prior
to appointment and are appointed with the agreement of the Company’s shareholder, for an initial
three-year term (subject to statutory provisions relating to removal) that may be extended.

Any term beyond six years for an Independent Non-Executive Director is subject to particularly
rigorous review and considers the need for progressive refreshing of the Board, balanced against
the requirement for skills, experience, independence and knowledge. Continuity of appointment of
some Independent Non-Executive Directors between price reviews is desirable to facilitate scrutiny
of Company performance against its business plan. The Board has determined that the Independent
Non-Executive Directors are independent for the purposes of the governance requirements.

In the year, the Board considered Fiona Reynolds’ term as an Independent Non-Executive Director.
Fiona’s experience as a director, with expertise in conservation and environmental matters has been
central to the Company’s work offering a constructive and challenging perspective to Board
discussions. As Fiona has been in position since 2012, the Board specifically considered Fiona’s
independence and was satisfied that Fiona could be considered independent.

All Independent Non-Executive Directors and David Barclay as a Non-Executive Director are
appointed on written terms of engagement setting the time commitments and standards required of
them. Non-Executive Directors representing the Company’s sole shareholder do not have formal
terms of appointment and receive no payments from the Company.

Induction programmes are designed and arranged for all new Directors to familiarise themselves
with the Company’s governance arrangements, business, regulatory framework, culture, and values.
The induction programme includes introductory meetings with all Executive and Non-Executive
Directors, the Company Secretary, and senior managers across the Company’s business. As part
of the induction programme, new Independent Non-Executive Directors visit the Company's principal
offices and operational sites, including the Company's Scientific Centre and the Company's billing
and customer services operations. In addition, any new Independent Non-Executive Directors meet
with Ofwat prior to formal appointments being made.

The training and development needs of the Directors are reviewed annually by the Senior
Independent Director (and not the Chair). This allows closer assessment of need and, where
relevant, all Directors are offered the opportunity to complete online training alongside the business.

Governance Report

Board meetings

The Board meets a minimum of six times a-year at approximately bi-monthly intervals, which is
considered sufficiently regular to enable the Board to discharge its duties effectively. It may meet on
such further occasions as required. The Board held seven meetings during the year. The Board
received regular reports on health and safety performance, business and financial performance,
regulatory issues, employee issues and the management of key business risks. The Board also
considered all key matters related to PR24. As a private company with a single shareholder, the
Company does not consider it necessary to hold Annual General Meetings. Attendance by individual
Directors at scheduled meetings of the Board and Committees during the financial year under review
was as follows:

All Directors have access to the Company Secretary and the Company’s internal solicitors. The
Company Secretary's responsibilities include ensuring good information flows within the Board and
its Committees and between senior management and Non-Executive Directors, as well as facilitating
induction and assisting with professional development as required. The Company Secretary is
responsible for ensuring that the Company's delegated authority and Board procedures are followed
and for advising on suggested changes.

Wessex Water Services Ltd 65

Governance Report

Ruth Jefferson was appointed as Company Secretary in 2018. As Company Secretary her role is to
provide legal and regulatory advice as required by the Board or any Director and she is responsible
for advising the Board through the Chair on governance matters. The Board is kept informed of major
changes to law and regulation affecting the Company's business. The Company Secretary also
advises on Directors’ duties and conflicts. All Directors are aware that any conflicts of interest must
be reported to and registered with the Company Secretary.

Board Committees and Advisory Panels
Five formal Board Committees operated throughout the financial year under review:

e Audit and Risk Committee

¢ Health and Safety Committee

« Remuneration Committee

e Nomination Committee

e Environment and Public Value Committee

These Committees operate under the authority of the Board and assist the Board in carrying out its
duties. The Committees have the appropriate balance of skills, experience, independence, and
knowledge of the Company. The Committees report to the Board on decisions and actions taken
together with any specific recommendations. Where necessary, final decisions are taken by the
Board.

Reports from the Chair of each of the Committees, including details of membership and attendance,
are set out on pages 71 to 96. There is a majority of Independent Non-Executive Directors on the
Board Committees. The Nomination Committee and Remuneration Committee are chaired by the
Chair and a shareholder Director respectively. The Board considers this to be appropriate in the
context of the Company’s ownership structure.

The Health and Safety Committee is also supported by an Advisory Board.

The Board also receives reports from the Customer Challenge Group, as part of the Company's
commitment to stakeholder engagement.

The Customer Challenge Group includes our key organisational stakeholders, scrutinises, and
assesses the Company’s delivery against customer related outcomes and performance
commitments. The Group is independently chaired by Dan Rogerson who was previously Water
Minister under the coalition Government. An Independent Director attends most meetings.

The Board also formed a PR24 Working Group attended by the Independent Non-Executive
Directors, the Non-Executive Director, and Executive Directors. The Working Group met several
times throughout the year. :

Board, Committee and Director Performance

The Board undertakes external evaluations on its performance every three years (most recently in
2023) supplemented by an annual confidential self-assessment of its Committees, the Chair, and
the Independent Non-Executive Directors, annually. The external evaluations are facilitated by the
Company Secretary on behalf of the Senior Independent Director. Both the external and self-
assessment evaluations assess the Board’s balance of skills, experience, diversity, independence,
and knowledge of the Company and how the Board works together as a unit, and other factors
related to its effectiveness.

Wessex Water Services Ltd 66

Governance Report

This year the feedback confirmed that, overall, the Board continues to work effectively with particular
recognition of the strength of the Board’s contribution to the Company’s purpose, strategy and
values. The strength of the trust levels between the Board and the executive and the Board’s good
knowledge and understanding of the Company’s business and performance were noted and provide —
a good basis for the business to face its various challenges.

Directors’ remuneration
Details of Directors’ remuneration are set out in the Remuneration Committee Report on page 80.
Directors’ interests and conflicts

The Board has a formal approach to conflicts of interest by including its conflicts within the business
ethics policy. This policy covers both employee and Board conflicts and enables Directors and
employees to identify, report and manage such conflicts. Directors are aware of the requirement to
disclose interests in contracts with the Company and any conflicts of interest are recorded by the
Company Secretary. Any new interests or conflicts were disclosed and recorded during the year.

Raising a concern

The Company reviews its ‘Raising a Concern’ policy each year. The policy is supported by step-by-
step guidance on how to raise concerns and a confidential helpline available 24-hours a day, 7-days
a week. The policy sets out how to report any concerns about wrongdoing or inappropriate activity
across all areas of business, including water regulation, health and safety, bribery, corruption, and
fraud. All‘Raising a Concern’ reports are treated on a strictly confidential basis whether from internal
or external sources. Reports are made to the Audit and Risk Committee.

Anti-corruption

The Company has adopted a formal policy on business ethics. Directors and employees are
expected to commit to the highest standards of professional and ethical conduct in order to protect
the Company’s reputation and standing. Bribery and corruption are not tolerated. All Directors and
employees are made aware of the Company's policy and understand that breaching it will result in
disciplinary action. No instances of a breach of the policy were recorded in the year. All senior staff
are asked to certify to internal audit that throughout the year they have complied with the business
ethics rules. No instances of non-compliance were noted during the year.

Financial Reporting

Material issues considered by the Audit and Risk Committee in relation to the financial statements
(as also reported by the external auditor) were as follows.

Topic

Activity

Revenue
Recognition and
accrued income

The Audit and Risk Committee considered the key financial risk that can
arise in two ways. Firstly the inappropriate revenue recognition from
manual journals and secondly, the estimation of the amount of unbilled
income charges at the period. In this context, they discussed that the
management estimates and assumptions are aligned to IFRS 15 and
current accounting standards.”

Classification and
Measurement of
Capital Expenditure

Valuation of
Intangible Assets
Developed Internally

The Audit and Risk Committee considered the key financial risk of the
degree of judgement involved in the classification of expenditure between
operating expenses and capital expenditure. In doing so they considered
the level of capital expenditure, the Regulatory Accounting Guidelines and
|AS16, the recharges from overhead to capital projects and the controls of
the Company. The Committee considered the financial impact of
internally developed intangible assets, including classification of capital
and operating expenditure, eligibility of capital expenditure, overhead
absorption and any potential asset impairment in accordance to IAS 38.

Expected Credit
Loss

Defined Benefit
Pension Obligations,

Assets, and Actuarial

Assumptions

Defined Benefit
Pension Assets

Going concern, long-
term viability and
breach of financial
covenants

The Audit and Risk Committee considered the key financial risk that arose
due to the subjective nature of the assumptions used. It reviewed the
significant judgements made when assessing the reasonableness of the
provision rates applied against historic collection rates and future
recovery, particularly in light of current cost of living difficulties and
economic uncertainties and ensured that the methodology chosen was in
accordance with IFRS 9.

The Audit and Risk Committee considered the key financial risk that the
assumptions made by the Company in association with the independent
actuary, in arriving at the pension obligations under IAS 19, could lead to
an overly prudent or aggressive position. In particular, the assumptions in
relation to inflation, discount rate, pension and salary increases, return on
equity and life expectancy were tested against the range of assumptions
used by other companies.

The Audit and Risk Committee considered the key financial risk of the
inappropriate valuation of hard to value pension assets, specifically
around private equity fund and pooled investments.

The Audit and Risk Committee considered the long-term viability
assessment and its appropriateness, assumptions, and its approach to
reverse stress testing. The Committee considered the going concern of
the company in conjunction with the work completed by the auditor under
IAS 570, including the company’s compliance with financial covenants and
the timing of bond issues.

Accounting for
litigation and any
legal provisions

The Audit and Risk Committee considered the key financial risk that arose
regarding the need for provisions for any legal or litigation action and
considered the judgement, recognition processes and estimations for any
such provision.

Misstatements

Management confirmed to the Audit and Risk Committee there were no
material misstatements in the financial statements to achieve a particular
presentation. The Audit and Risk Committee was satisfied that the
external auditor had fulfilled its responsibilities to the Audit Committee and
the Company.

There is a majority of independent members on the Nomination Committee, in line with Ofwat's
Objectives. The Nomination Committee is chaired by a Non-Executive Director appointed by the
shareholder, by way of exception to Ofwat’s Objectives. However, the Committee’s composition is
considered to be appropriate in the context of a private company with a single shareholder.

Role and report on activities
The Nomination Committee's full terms of reference are available on the Company’s website.

The purpose of the Nomination Committee is to ensure that appropriate procedures are in place for
the nomination, selection, training, and evaluation of Directors. The role of the Nomination
Committee is to evaluate the balance of skills, experience, and knowledge on the Board. The
Committee reviews Board structure, size and composition and will make recommendations to the
Board on new appointments and succession. The Board will also consider any extensions to the
term of appointment for Directors.

Throughout the year the members of the Committee met once to discuss succession planning for
the Chief Executive. The members considered the balance of skills and experience required for the
Chief Executive role, the potential candidates and timing. Subsequently, Ruth Jefferson, the Chief
Compliance Officer was chosen to succeed Colin Skellett as the next Chief Executive of Wessex
Water.

The Board also considered the re-appointment of Fiona Reynolds as an Independent Non-Executive
Director and concluded that Fiona demonstrated a fully independent approach, offering a
constructive and challenging perspective to Board discussions. The Board decided to extend Fiona’s
appointment for an additional one-year term.

each meeting. This year it has met five times to focus on the Company's delivery of its strategy and
continuous improvement. This is in addition to the regular health, safety and wellbeing reports which
are presented to the Board and demonstrates the Board's commitment on. matters relating to health,
safety, and wellbeing. Members of the Board have made regular visits to Wessex Water sites and
teams in the field.

There is a majority of independent members on the Committee. The Committee is chaired by
a Non-Executive Director appointed by the shareholder, by way of exception to Ofwat's
Objectives. However, the Committee reflects the requirements of a private company with a
sole shareholder, but with most of the independent membership ensuring a formal and
transparent procedure for developing policy on executive remuneration.

There were no changes to the membership of the Committee for 2023-24.

Role of the Remuneration Committee .
The Committee's full terms of reference are available on the Company's website.

The Committee determines, on behalf of the Board, the Company’s policy on the total
remuneration of Executive Directors, the Chief Executive, and senior executive managers.
The Committee ensures there is a link between reward and performance to promote the long-
term success of the Company and does not reward poor performance.

This report sets out the remuneration policy for the Directors of Wessex Water and discloses |
the amounts paid to them in the financial year ended 30 June 2024. The policy also applies to
the remuneration of the Company’s senior managers.

Activities of the Remuneration Committee

The Committee met twice during the financial year under review. The Committee continued to
monitor the Company’s remuneration policy to take account of evolving best and market
practice. The annual bonus plan is designed to promote the success of the Company in
achieving its objectives over the five-year regulatory period and is based on a portfolio of KPIs
linked to the Company's performance scorecard and Ofwat’s measures of success.

‘

Strategic Alignment of Remuneration

Salary and bonus levels were benchmarked against the Korn Ferry Hay Group National
Utilities market sector with jobs sized in relation to scope, role responsibilities and impact to
determine salary. The Committee continued to take a proactive approach to responding to
developments in legislation, best practice, and the wider market, as well as the corporate
strategy, in order to ensure that the Company’s senior executive reward policy remained
market competitive and appropriate.

Wessex Water Services Ltd 80

Remuneration Committee Report

The Committee ensured that any changes in senior executive remuneration were
proportionate in the context of workforce pay. Whilst it has not set a specific policy on the
relationship between Executive Directors’ pay and that of the rest of the workforce, it aims to
ensure that executive salary movement is appropriately aligned to the rest of the workforce,
and it specifically considers this aspect as part of its decision-making process.

The Committee considered performance related executive pay in the context of Ofwat’s
requirement that performance related pay should demonstrate a substantial link to stretching
performance delivery for customers, communities, and the environment. The Company is
committed to transparency around the relationship between pay and overall performance.

To ensure that the Company’s remuneration practices are competitive but not excessive, the
Committee has access to detailed external research on market data and trends from
experienced specialist consultants.

Remuneration of the Senior Management Group

The Committee takes advice from their independent advisers, Korn Ferry Hay Group. Korn
Ferry Hay Group provided detailed market analysis and advice to the Committee for the senior
management group, including Executive Directors and Non-Executive Directors. There were
no payments made to Korn Ferry Hay Group for the year ended 30 June 2024. In line with
best practice, the Committee assesses from time to time whether the appointment of its current
independent remuneration advisers remains appropriate and whether the role should be put
out to tender.

The Committee also considers what compensation commitments (including pension
contributions and all other elements) Directors’ terms of appointment would entail in the event
of early termination. The aim is to avoid rewarding poor performance, and the Remuneration
Committee would take a robust line on reducing compensation to reflect departing Directors’
obligations to mitigate loss.

The Chief Executive (Colin Skellett) and the Group Director of People (Mark Nicholson) attend
the Committee meetings to provide advice and respond to specific questions. They did not
participate in any discussion concerning their own remuneration.

Changes to the Executive Directors

There were no changes to the Executive Directors of the Company during 2023-24.

Remuneration principles and policy

The Committee continues to monitor variable pay arrangements for Executive Directors and
senior managers. The Committee believes that the arrangements are appropriately managed
and that the choice of performance measures and targets does not encourage undue risk-
taking by the executives so that the long-term performance of the business is not put at risk
by considerations of short-term value. The arrangements incorporate a range of internal and
external performance metrics, measuring both operational and financial performance
providing a rounded assessment of overall company performance to ensure that a significant
portion of executive remuneration is performance related. More details on the remuneration
policy for Executive Directors is shown later in this report.

Wessex Water Services Ltd 81

Remuneration Committee Report

Recruitment of Executive Directors

The base salary for any new Executive Director takes into account market data for the relevant
role, relativity with the salaries of existing Executive Directors, the individual’s previous
experience, and current base salary. If an individual is recruited at below market level, their
base salary may be aligned over a period of time to the median of the relevant market position,
subject to their performance in the role.

Individual Executive Directors participate in a senior manager bonus scheme, governed by
the Committee. Executive Directors have a target bonus set at 50% of base salary and their
maximum bonus at 100% of base salary.

Policy for loss of office

There are no specific provisions for compensation on early termination (except for payment in
lieu of accrued but untaken holidays) or loss of office due to a change of ownership of the
Company. The Committee will review all contractual obligations and will seek legal advice, as
and when necessary, on the Company’s liability to pay compensation in such circumstances.

The Committee will seek to reduce the level of compensation payable taking into account,
among other factors, the Company's and the individual's performance, the Executive
Director's obligation to mitigate loss, and length of service.

Early termination payments made in the year
There were no early termination payments during the year.

Remuneration Committee Report

Base salaries and benefits

Executive Directors’ remuneration is reviewed annually by the Committee and takes effect
from 1 April. Salaries are set with reference to individual performance, experience, and
contribution, together with development in the relevant employment market (having regard to
the median position for the national utilities market) and internal relativities.

The Committee gives due consideration to the current economic climate and current market
practice regarding executive salary reviews and the broader employee salary review policy at
the Company.

We do not normally link pay levels to company performance measures, as this is done where
appropriate through the bonus arrangements.

Executive Directors’ base salary 2023-24
The Committee reviewed base salaries of the Executive Directors effective 1 April 2023.

salary increase of 7.2% was backdated and applied effective 1 January 2023. This was in
accordance with a one-year deal agreed with the recognised Trade Unions and also awarded
to those employees not covered by trade union agreements.

Executive Directors’ bonuses 2023-24 _

All Executive Director bonuses for 2023-24 are funded by the shareholder with no costs
borne by the Company’s customers. The Chief Executive is not receiving a bonus following
the conclusion of prosecutions for two serious pollution incidents in 2018.The annual bonus
of Executive Directors is performance-related and designed to promote the long-term
success of the Company. It is dependent on the achievement of Company and individual
targets.

would Executive Directors be eligible for any bonus payment. The

Committee would take account of any extenuating circumstances outside the control of the
Company when determining the level of bonus payments.

The size of the bonus award was determined by Company financial performance, against
targets set by the Board. This aligns with the shareholder's expectations and ensures that
bonuses reflect the financial performance of the Company.

Remuneration Committee Report

Pensions
Defined Benefit Scheme
The majority of Executive Directors are members of the Wessex Water defined benefit pension

scheme. The scheme is a HMRC registered defined benefit occupational pension scheme. The
Executive Directors are members of the WPS section, which provides:

¢ anormal retirement age of 65 years

* a pension at normal retirement age based on 1/60th of completed pensionable service and
final pensionable salary

e life cover of four times basic salary
* apension payable in the event of retirement on grounds of ill health
¢ adependent’s pension on death of two thirds of the member's pension

¢ guaranteed increases in line with price inflation (subject to a maximum of 5% each year).

Members’ contributions are payable at the rate of 8% of basic salary, with the Company making a
further 24.6% contribution. Early payment of pension is available from age 55 with the consent of
the Company. Any pension would be subject to a reduction, based on rates the trustees consider
appropriate, acting on actuarial advice, to reflect the expected longer payment of the pension. No
additional pension will become receivable by a Director if that Director retires early.

In the event of incapacity, an unreduced pension is payable immediately. Incapacity pensions can
be paid on either a ‘partial’ or ‘full ill health’ basis depending on the conditions met. A full ill health
pension is topped up to give additional service to age 65, subject to a maximum of 20 years.

Under the Trust Deed and Rules, pensions in payment in excess of any guaranteed minimum
pension are guaranteed to increase in line with price inflation subject to a maximum of 5% each year.
In the calculation of individual cash equivalent transfer values, allowance is made for such increases.

As a result of the changes in pension legislation for high earners, Wessex Water has introduced the
following options for individuals under age 55 who are affected by the tax changes:

« continue in the scheme, with individuals meeting any tax liabilities as they fall due; or

« continue in the scheme with a capped pensionable salary which restricts pension growth to
the annual allowance limit (£50,000 pa) and receive a cash supplement in lieu of pension
entitlement on the excess salary. The cash supplement is based on the employer contribution
rate to the scheme. :

Defined Contribution Scheme

Other Executive Directors are enrolled in the YTL UK Group Section of the Aon MasterTrust which
provides.

¢ Employee contributions options, deducted from salary at between 3% and 8% per annum

¢ Company contributions of between 5% and 12% per annum (dependent on the level of
employee contribution) in addition to the amount the individual pays

« A default normal retirement age of 65 years

e The option to select an alternative retirement age

Remuneration Committee Report

Differences between Executive Directors’ and Employees’ remuneration

The following differences exist between the Company's policy for the remuneration of Executive
Directors and its policy for the remuneration of employees.

e Executive Directors pay and benefits are benchmarked against the median position of the
National Utilities market whilst we benchmark pay and benefits for all fully qualified and
experienced employees against the median position of the Willis Towers Watson Energy and
National Resources remuneration survey

¢ a lower level of target and maximum annual bonus opportunity applies to various employees
when compared to Executive Directors

e Executive Directors (and senior managers) participate in a bonus scheme that is not available
to other employees to motivate and reward them for achievement of demanding financial
objectives and key strategic measures.

In general, these differences arise from the development of remuneration arrangements that are
market competitive for the various categories of staff ranging from employees to Executive Directors.

Executive Directors’ service contracts

All Executive Directors’ service contracts are terminable by either the Company or the Executive
Director providing 12 months’ notice. There is a theoretical maximum payment in case of redundancy
of 100% of salary inclusive of allowances and benefits plus a redundancy entitlement. There are no
specific contractual payments or benefits which would be triggered in the event of a change in control
of the Company.

Executive Directors’ service contracts are available for inspection during normal office hours at the
registered office, Wessex Water, Claverton Down Road, Bath BA2 7WW. The Committee will
continue to review the contractual terms for Executive Directors to ensure they reflect best practice
and are compliant with employment law.

Non-Executive Directors

The remuneration policy for Independent Non-Executive Directors is determined by the Board. The
remuneration reflects the time commitment and responsibilities of the role.

The breakdown of the Independent Non-Executive Directors’ fees from 1 July 2023 is shown in the
Directors’ Emoluments table below. Independent Non-Executive Directors do not participate in share
or bonus schemes or any other performance-related scheme, nor is any pension provision made.

Wessex Water Services Ltd 90

Remuneration Committee Report

Independent Non-Executive Directors are normally appointed for three-year terms (subject to
statutory provisions relating to the removal of a Director) that may be renewed. They do not have
service contracts, but their terms of engagement are regulated by letters of appointment (copies of
which are available for inspection during normal office hours at the registered office). Any term
beyond six years for an Independent Non-Executive Director is subject to particularly rigorous review
and considers the need for progressive refreshing of the Board balanced against the requirement for
skills, experience, independence, and knowledge.

Non-Executive Directors appointed by the shareholder do not receive any fees or other payments
from the Company.

Notes:

1. The Company chose Option A as the preferred method of calculating the pay ratio for the financial year
under review. The individual pay and benefits for every employee of the company were determined (for the
financial year being reported on the Director's Remuneration Report).

2. The pay and benefits were ranked from lowest to 0 highest, and the employees at the 25th, 50th and 75th
percentiles were identified.

3. The pay ratios were calculated by dividing the CEO’s single table of remuneration with the employee pay
and benefits at each of those percentile points. The pay ratio was calculated for all employees as at April
2024.

4. Full-time equivalent (FTE) remuneration was determined by assuming that all full-time employees are
engaged on a 40 hour per week contract. Remuneration for all part-time employees was re-calculated to a
40 hour per week, full time equivalent.

Financial measures

At the end of the financial year, the Committee will review company and individual performance,
taking into account performance against the measures.

Only if the Committee judges that three quarters or more of the customer and environmental targets
have been achieved, will Executive Directors be eligible for any bonus payment. The Committee
would take account of any extenuating circumstances outside the control of the Company when
determining the level of bonus payments.

The size of the bonus award is determined by Company financial performance, against targets set
by the Board. This aligns with the shareholder's expectations and means that bonuses will reflect
the financial performance of the Company.

Risk Management

Risk management

The effective management of risk is central to how we can deliver effective and efficient services
to our customers and minimise the impact we have on the environment. It is critical that we have
a robust risk management framework in which material risks to the business are proactively
identified, evaluated, communicated and the appropriate response defined and implemented.
The Company’s processes are flexible to respond to changes in risk and ensure that the
necessary controls and mitigation measures are put in place. Risks are defined as any event
that can impede our ability to achieve our objectives. The most significant risks facing us are
referred to as ‘principal risks.

Risk management process

Our policy on risk assessment and management is subject to regular review by the Board
including the review and update of risk and tolerance levels. The board reviews all strategic
risks and other principal risks on a regular basis.

Identification and management of risk is delivered through a hierarchy of risk management
reviews from operational colleagues, senior management, and Executive Directors. The Board
reviews and is ultimately responsible for risk. To assist it in discharging its responsibilities, the
Audit and Risk Committee reviews the company’s internal control systems and process for
managing risk.

Operational staff and senior management review and assess asset and operational risk
monthly. Risks are scored based on likelinood and impact on a ‘five-by-five’ scoring mechanism.
Risk mitigation plans are recorded and implemented where appropriate and pre-and post-
mitigation scores are monitored.

Operational risks act as a foundation for separate tactical risk registers which feed into the
corporate risk register. The Risk Management Group maintains and reviews all business risks;
the corporate risk register reflects strategic, compliance, operational and financial risks,
specifically including health and safety and climate change related risks.

The Risk Management Group comprises senior managers from across the business. The risks
are assessed by subject matter experts and subject to independent challenge from our risk
experts. Risks above our tolerance levels will have additional measures to manage and mitigate
the risk exposure.

As well as monthly updates on emergent risks, every six months the Risk Management Group
submits a summary of the corporate risk register and a report on the Principal risks to the
Executive Leadership Team (ELT), comprising the Executive Directors.

The ELT scrutinises and challenges the risks, ensuring that we have comprehensively classified
and assessed our risks and have appropriate mitigation methods. Any significant emergent risks
or material changes in existing risks are reported to the ELT and the Board as they arise.

The CEO submits a bi-annual risk review paper to the Board. This paper details the risk process,
identifies the current principal risks (listed below) to the business and the mitigation measures.
It also records the status of emerging risks that have been identified as well as any proposed
changes to risk appetite and tolerance for discussion at the Board.

Wessex Water Services Ltd 97

Risk Management

The Board reviews the Company’s risk identification and management policy annually and
reviews the principal risks bi-annually. It delegates its authority to the Audit and Risk Committee
for the review and oversight of the effectiveness of the risk management process. To aid it in
doing this, the Audit and Risk Committee includes audits that review the status and mitigations
of the principal risks when agreeing the annual Internal Audit programme.

Risk Management

We continuously review and improve the risk management framework. Since the last annual
review, the following changes have been made:

« we have successfully deployed the operational module of our governance, risk and
compliance system, with work underway to rollout the enterprise risk module in
2024-25.

¢ our existing risk management scoring for operational risks has been reviewed and data
is being updated to reflect this revised approach.

e the Board have reviewed the risk appetite framework and agreed updated appetite and
tolerance positions aligned to the Company's strategic objectives and principal risks.

Further improvements are planned as part of the implementation of our risk and investment
framework over the coming year.

Principal risks

While the corporate risk register holds over 50 risks at any time, the principal risks are those
that the Board consider could have a material impact on the capability of the business to perform
its functions. All these risks are subject to active mitigation strategies and the Board considers
that the Company is taking appropriate action to mitigate the severity and likelihood of those
risks to an acceptable level.

In terms of risk trends, resilience in the supply chain and cyber security remains a concern due
to heightened global geopolitical tensions. Challenges in recruitment of resources remains an
issue, although the situation has improved with an increase in quality candidates applying for
roles evident over the last 12 months.

We can demonstrate through our environmental investigations, biodiversity and Conservation,
Access and Recreation (CAR) work that the environment within our area is improving as a result
of extensive nutrient removal programmes, catchment permitting, catchment nutrient balancing
and biodiversity improvements. Despite these initiatives positively reducing harm to the
environment, increased environmental monitoring, regulatory scrutiny and foreseeable changes
to the definition of performance metrics are likely to negatively impact how regulators assess
our environmental performance.

We continue to seek opportunities to maximise benefit to customers, having recently published
our cross-sector proposal advocating for ‘Sustainable Solutions for Water and Nature’
(SSWAN). .

The Principal risk “Technology resilience” has been widened to cover all security events that
could affect our operations with the revised Principal risk of ‘Secure sites, systems and
operations’.

We have summarised our principal risks below. Further information is then provided on each
- principal risk including a statement on the context and the mitigation in place to address each
risk.

Supply chain resilience

Description of the risk

Resource scarcity or disruptions to supply
chains which prevent the procurement of

products or services at the expected cost,
availability, or quality.

Context

Several events in the chemical supply chain ~

over recent years have highlighted the
fragility of some of the industry's suppliers.
The government has also identified that the
most significant single risk to public water
supplies is a failure in the chemical supply
chain.

This is a market issue where we have only
limited means of proactively mitigating any
supply chain loss, although we are relatively
well placed compared to other water
companies. Our controls are particularly
important, and we have reviewed our
business continuity arrangements for loss of
supply of chemicals and loss of critical
supplies generally.

Risk Appetite statement

We will reduce the risk of supply chain
disruption that jeopardises core company
outcomes to as low as reasonably
practicable.

Risk Management

Mitigation and controls include

Description of the risk

An internal or external threat actor initiates a
security incident that: renders the business
unable to deliver the supply of safe drinking
water and the management of waste; results
in breaches of data protection or other laws;
or impacts critical activities such as regulatory
and financial reporting.

Context

Threats to safety, security and business
resilience range from activism and criminal
activity, and up to Nation State sponsored
threats (including some types of cyber-crime
and sabotage). Physical Security, Cyber
Security, Information Security and Personnel
Security measures are operated in
combination to counter and contain such
threats and to recover quickly from incidents,
helping to protect the personnel, sites,
information assets, Information Technology
(IT) and Operational Technology (OT)
systems that are fundamental to our daily
operations and activities.

Risk Appetite statement

We must understand the threats to the
security of our sites, systems and operations
and employ the appropriate controls to

external hazard that affects the health and
safety of employees, contractors, or the
public.

Context

Working with and around water, sewage, gas,

construction sites, plant and equipment
exposes employees, contractors and the
public to man-made and naturally occurring
hazards.

The Board remains committed to
understanding our occupational and process
safety risks and ensuring that they’re
appropriately managed.

Uninformed action
Description of the risk

Inadequate information (e.g. poor asset data)
resulting in sub-optimal decision-making,
unsatisfactory day to day business operation/
performance and/or an increase in cost and
risk.

Context

The environment in which we're operating in
means that each decision needs to be the
right one. Failure to make the right decision
can have a direct impact on cost, increase
the company’s risk profile or create an
immediate impact to customers or the
environment through a pollution or service
outage. Making the right decision is reliant on
our people and systems having access to
adequate information.

Risk Appetite statement

We will reduce the risk of inadequate
information that has a material impact on the
company’s performance, cost and/or risk. We
will use assurance activities to verify the
quality of data as appropriate.

Resources and skills

Description of the risk

Failure to have the right resources with the
right skills in the right place will have an effect
on our ability to operate effectively and on our
strategic objectives.

Context

Our business is made up of almost 2,900
employees undertaking a wide range of roles
with varying skills requirements. For some
time there has been national shortage in
STEM skills (Science, Technology,
Engineering and Maths). However, post-
Brexit and Covid 19 there is a national
shortage of resources in total, affecting most
sectors and roles. Many people are now used

to home working and are less willing to move ©

for a new job.

Staff retention remains key to maintaining the
highly skilled, committed, and talented people
we need.

Risk Appetite statement

We will actively seek opportunities to improve
our reputation as an ‘employer of choice’ to

attract and retain the best talent, and we will -

ensure succession and workforce planning
for key skills that are difficult to recruit in the
market.

Risk Management

Mitigation and controls include

Wessex Water Services Ltd 112

Supply of unfit or insufficient water
Description of the risk

Inability to provide a reliable source of water
to customers when they need it in line with
quality standards.

Context

We treat and supply more than 280 million
litres of water a day to 1.4 million customers.
Providing wholesome drinking water is a
fundamental obligation to our customers and
a responsibility that we take very seriously.

There are many risks that can affect our
ability to deliver the right quantity and quality
of water to our customers cost effectively.
Our Water Resource Management Plan
identifies the long-term approach to
addressing these and other emerging issues
while continuing to provide the expected
quantity and quality of water.

Our resilience and performance is measured ©

by a combination of performance
commitments and other metrics to ensure we
continue to make appropriate risk-based
decisions for the short, medium and long

Financial viability

Description of the risk

Inability to raise finance at appropriate levels
and/or manage cash/gearing to maintain
financial viability and provide a fair return on
investment.

Context

The Company has a significant and
increasing funding requirement for its
investment programme and refinancing
maturing debt, both in the current AMP period
and into the future.

At present there are significant global
economic and financial implications. These
include the conflicts in Ukraine and the
Middle East, global logistics affecting delivery
times, and insufficient experienced resources.

Furthermore there remains ongoing
uncertainty within the UK water industry -
surrounding the regulatory settlement and the
knock-on effect on access to markets.

This is a well-controlled risk, but it is
important we continue to maintain our high
standards to mitigate the risk.

Risk Appetite statement

We work to ensure the company remains
financially resilient now and for the duration of
our long-term viability statement.

Risk Management

Mitigation and controls include

¢ Maintain communications and strong

relationships with financial institutions and

Wessex Water Services Ltd 114

Long Term Viability Statement

Long-term viability statement

The Company has a long-term commitment to the provision of resilient services for the
communities it serves and plans on the basis of stewardship in perpetuity.

In October 2023 we submitted our 2025-30 business plan. This sets out our tong-term delivery
strategies and outlined operational plans out to 31 March 2035. Given this the Directors have
determined 2035 as an appropriate planning horizon for the Company’s long term viability
statement. There does however remain significant uncertainty for the period after 2025,
increasing further when beyond 2030 is considered.

Under Section 2 of the Water Industry Act 1991 as amended, Ofwat continue to have a duty to
secure that water companies can (in particular through securing reasonable returns on their
capital) finance the proper carrying out of their statutory functions. Ofwat should always provide
a level of return that is commensurate with the risk being borne, which our modelling and other
work illustrates, and which underpins the long term viability tests. As mentioned, late last year
we submitted our business plan to the regulator, and in July 2024 Ofwat published its provisional
assessment of our plan, known as its draft determination. This set out its view on all aspects of
our plan, including required levels of investment, the performance that it expects from this
investment, and the associated level of customer bills.

In light of Ofwat’s assessment, in August 2024 we submitted further information which included
some changes to our initial plan which reflected both the challenges presented by Ofwat and
new requirements that have arisen during the year. Our response to Ofwat’s draft determination
used Ofwat’s assessment of cost of capital assumptions in Ofwat’s models, however the Board
stands behind the compelling evidence we submitted in our PR24 business plan outlining our
assessment of cost of capital which is higher.

For the most immediate term analysis up to 31 December 2025 the Directors have taken into
account:
e the current financial position of the Company, its cash deposits and available funds,

e the expected turnover up to March 2025 from the customer charges that have already
been set,

e that the larger capital expenditure programme is of a similar nature to that delivered in
previous regulatory control periods, allowing the Directors to be able to predict the cost of
construction with some certainty,

e that borrowing facilities in place are in the majority long term and maturing after 31
December 2025 with a mix of borrowings spread between fixed, floating and index linked,
and predictions of interest rates,

e the need for additional financing and the increasing cost of debt,

e that there are sufficient finance facilities in place to fund our working capital requirements,
and :

The key areas considered by the Directors in this regard were:

e the principal risks as shown in the Annual Review Summary,

» the shocks and stresses shown in the Company's resilience action plan,

e the liquidity of the Company over the years, and

« compliance with financial covenants in respect of gearing and interest cover.

Wessex Water Services Ltd 115

Long Term Viability Statement

Having done so, the Directors confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that the
Company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due up to 31
December 2025. Further details are given in Note 1 on page 148 of the financial statements.

The Company’s approach to the assessment and consideration of the full range of risks,
including common external risks that affect the water sector as whole as well as specific
Company risks is detailed in the previous section of this Annual Report and Accounts document
(see pages 97 to 114). :

When assessing financial viability over a longer period, Directors considered:

e the financial and operational impact if the risks identified in the corporate risk register
were to occur,

e the impact on WWSL if risks related to the wider group were to occur,

e the wider economic and regulatory environment, and

e the impact of any other foreseeable risk.

This ensures that all operational, financial, and regulatory risks and liabilities are fully
considered. The assumptions used in stress testing for this viability statement are consistent
with this wider risk assessment reported elsewhere in the Company's accounts.

The Corporate risk register is updated on an on-going basis and reviewed by the Company's
tisk management group and Board every six months to ensure it is a true reflection of the
circumstances of the Company. The potential financial impacts (shocks) of the principal risks
contained in the Corporate risk register are summarised in the below table:

Supply of unfit or insufficient water

Scenarios were then developed ensuring that the analysis correctly identified linked and
compounded risks and were sensitivity tested with reasonable, plausible, and extreme levels

of severity.

Wessex Water Services Ltd 117

Long Term Viability Statement

Scenario Details and sensitivity testing

Wastewater
incident

This might include a major pollution incident or the widespread
distribution of unfit water, either driven by catastrophic asset failure,
extreme weather events or malicious damage. The base scenarios
include the capital costs of rectification and then increases severity
by progressively including risks of fines, penalties from regulatory
delivery incentives, customer compensation payments and at the
most extreme the withholding of customer bill payments.

Water supply
incident

Simultaneous water
and wastewater
incidents

As above but assumes incidents occur concurrently.

This scenario assumes a sustained economic downturn in the UK
that increases company input prices and reduces productivity
resulting in sustained overspends of regulatory cost allowances
while depressing indices of consumer prices and reducing company
sales. An accompanying credit squeeze means that the costs of
new finance increase.

Macroeconomy

Combined Assumes operational failure coincides with higher input costs
operational and resulting in consistent overspends against regulatory allowances.
macroeconomic Alongside this depressed consumer price indices reduce sales and
shock regulatory value. Sensitivity testing increases the severity by |
assuming demand and sales volumes also decrease and the
company suffers higher interest costs through a credit rating
downgrade. ,

New unfunded
obligations

This scenario assumes that government or regulators impose new
obligations on the Company that create additional costs and diverts
management focus leading to operational failure. These are
modelled individually and then alongside operational or
macroeconomic shocks to fully test the resilience of the company.

Extreme weather Extreme weather event (either a ‘beast from the east’ or a prolonged
event dry period) causes overspend on operational expenditure and asset
failures resulting in ODI penalties.

Climate change Ongoing climate change causes more uncertain weather, dryer
summers and wetter winters lead to additional operational and
maintenance expenditure. This was modelled individually and
alongside operational and macroeconomic shocks to fully test the
resilience of the company.

The individual shocks, scenarios, and levels of sensitivity considered within the financial viability
assessment are reviewed and agreed by senior management across the finance, risk and
investment, and economic regulation teams. Our full approach to risk identification,
management and mitigation is described on pages 97 to 114 of this Annual Report and
Accounts. These are then presented to the Company's Audit and Risk Committee for review.

In total the Company modelled 36 scenarios, including those outlined in the PR24 final
methodology, the most severe of which consider multiple concurrent and linked risks.

When considering long term financial viability the Directors primarily considered the ability of
the Company to retain credit metrics consistent with an investment grade credit rating, as this
would continue to grant access to the debt and equity markets for the Company to finance its
functions.

1:3 years shock
- Input price
mismatch

Lower inflation

Unfunded

The Directors note the PR19 final determination significantly reduced the headroom available
which, coupled with extreme global pressures on costs, results in a challenging short-term
position. This is further compounded in the medium term by the significant investment pressures
over the next price control period, with expenditure expected to be three to four times that
previously seen. Looking forward this creates significant pressure on gearing that even in the
base case threatens the ability to maintain an investment grade credit rating and avoid
breaching the financial covenants on our debt facilities.

If, as expected, the increased scale of investment continues longer term, there is sustained
downwards pressure on selected debt covenants (EBITDA / Interest). This may pose an issue
towards the end of the assessed period. However, we believe that through constructive
engagement with lenders this will be resolved as in these cases we maintain the key credit
rating metrics (AICR / PMICR and gearing) consistent with investment grade credit rating and
have a track record of positive engagement and strong performance that could improve future
ratios.

In many of these scenarios we see further pressure on key credit rating metrics (gearing and
interest covers) that may threaten the company’s investment grade credit rating, and cause
breaches to the financial covenants on our debt facilities. This is of particular note where there
is sustained low inflation and significant totex overspends, and on interest covers with sudden
reductions in revenue and significant fines.

Multiple control measures are in place to mitigate or prevent impacts. These include:

Wessex Water Services Ltd 119

Long Term Viability Statement

e Insurance against significant one-off shocks such as flooding

This will help the Company recover some of the totex incurred in specific shocks where they
are driven by insurable external risks.

e The suite of regulatory reconciliation mechanisms in place to allocate risk between the
company and customers

These mechanisms will help mitigate the impact of reduced demand on revenues through the
RFI and help mitigate the impact of additional expenditure through the totex reconciliation
models. Further protections to the RCV revenues exist in the cost of debt indexation
mechanism. ;

e Reducing expenditure with limited short or medium-term benefits

This alongside restriction of executive pay can help offset other increases in totex. However,
given the scale and uncertainty of the upcoming capital programme we will not have the ability
to completely offset increases in costs, and these levers will have lower impact than in previous
assessments. It is imperative to note that if this restriction on expenditure is required over the
longer term this will place more stress on the business and reduce its long-term resilience.

« Restricting dividends

The Company has always committed to ensuring it maintains a solid investment grade credit
rating and operates a flexible dividend policy that will help ensure this. The Directors note that
dividends can be restricted before the new cash lock up clause in the licence comes into force
if there is foresight of the risks. As outlined in our PR24 submission, in our base case dividends
are already completely restricted over 2025-30 to fund real RCV growth.

The table below sets out which financial shocks were considered in the most extreme case for
each scenario and indicates the pre and post mitigation impact on gearing (target <80%), and
interest covers (Moodys AICR target >1.1x, PMICR target >1.1x and EBITDA / Interest target >
2.75x). Red represents sustained breaches of a level consistent with investment grade credit
rating, amber represents short term breaches that we would expect rating agencies to look
through (as evidenced currently with the high inflation & RPI/CPIH wedge shock) and green
represents limited issues. :

Long Term Viability Statement

The Directors note that in many cases the four mitigations outlined were sufficient to restrict the
breaches to short-term failures relating to specific shocks, where further action would have
limited immediate impact. The Directors considered that in these cases the impact would not
affect the underlying viability of the Company as credit rating agencies focus more on the overall
trends and sustained exceedance of metrics.

Where there are still sustained breaches then this is resolved through equity issuance in the
next five years of c£0.6bn, with further requirements if the scale of investment continues post
2030. We have a long-term shareholder who considers their stewardship in perpetuity and who
stands ready to invest into Wessex Water, for a fair return under a stable regulatory framework.

The Directors also note the further protections in the regulatory model, (such as interim
determinations, or subsequent price determinations recognising a material shift in the balance
of risk), which in many of these scenarios, would allow turnover to be adjusted upwards in the
event of a substantial adverse effect on the financial position of the Company.

Following these assessments, the Directors confirm that they have a reasonable expectation
that the Company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due up
to 31 March 2035.

Before agreeing this statement, the Directors, through the Audit and Risk Committee which
contains all independent directors, challenged company management on its analysis of the risks
and of the mitigations. In making this statement the Directors have made the following reasoned
and reasonable assumptions:

e that the final determination will be broadly consistent with the company’s submitted
response to Ofwat's draft determination;

e the availability of finance capital;

e stability of the financial regulatory framework;

e that Ofwat will continue to perform its statutory duty to ensure that the Company can finance
the proper carrying out of its statutory functions; and

e the Company has an active and long-term shareholder, YTL, and is committed to fong-
term stewardship and investment for a fair return.

1. Governance

Our Board is responsible for our risks and through the Environment and Public Value Committee
manages our principal risk of climate volatility (page 105). The Board’s Environment and Public
Value committee advises the Board on the development and delivery of the Company's purpose,
strategy, and values, which drive change and influence the company’s environment and social
purpose (page 78). The Audit and Risk Committee provides assurance and challenges the overall
risk, control, and governance framework on behalf of the Board including for our principal risk of
climate volatility (page 71). Our governance arrangements are outlined in our Governance Report
(page 53) and how we meet the Ofwat Better Leadership, Transparency and Governance objectives
as well as the Wates Principles (page 58 to 70). The Board reviews and monitors the Company’s
progress against numerous environmental performance commitments, including our greenhouse
gas emissions.

Wessex Water Services Ltd 123

Climate-related Financial Disclosures

Responsibility for responding to climate related risk and opportunities is shared across the
Directorates and is part of our overall approach to risk and resilience. The Director of Planning, Risk
and Investment manages our resilience framework through two groups: the Risk Management
Group, who manage the overall risk and resilience process; and the Investment Solutions Group,
who review and approve capital-based mitigations to improve our resilience. Climate change and
volatility is one of the stresses identified in our resilience action plan.

We have produced three climate change adaptation reports, meeting the Government's adaptation
reporting duty. These cover the physical climate risks, identified, and graded, and the management
measures being used (outlined in the strategy and risk management sections in more detail).
Management review the progress being made toward our net zero carbon route map annually. We
report our carbon footprint each year to Ofwat and within this report.

2. Strategy

We are a long-term business and aim to be a genuinely sustainable water Company. As such, we
are attuned to changes that will take place over several decades. .Our management plans for water
resources and, drainage and wastewater have a 25-year timescale, and we reflect UK climate
projections running to the end of the 21% century. These long-term plans are translated into short-
and medium-term delivery through the five-year investment plan cycles. We have identified impacts
over the short (0-10 years), medium (10-30 years), and long term (30-100 years) horizons.

Policies and Strategies

As our services and operations are affected by weather patterns, our action plans related to climate
change and resilience are crucial to our business. Climate-related impacts have a bearing on many
of the core services that we provide — they affect water availability, water quality, and the efficacy of
sewerage and surface water management, among other things. Heatwaves and drought have clear
impacts on water supply and demand, while prolonged or intense rainfall affects the quality of water
sources and the capacity of our wastewater network. Adapting to a changing climate is integral
therefore to our long-term strategic direction, five-year business plans, and subject-specific
exercises such as water resources planning. Our climate change adaptation report sets out overall
strategy and our programme of work in the short and long term, in relation to our main physical
climate risks.

Alongside physical risks associated with climate, we will be affected by the necessary transition to a
low carbon economy. Transition risks and opportunities are also evident for both functions,
especially when we include embodied emissions in construction materials and consumables.
Providing water and wastewater services involves significant amounts of energy use and emissions
of methane and nitrous oxide as well as carbon dioxide. Our wastewater emissions are larger than
water supply emissions and will also be harder to abate, especially in relation to process emissions.
We are committed to reducing our carbon footprint, reflecting the expectations of our external
stakeholders — including investors, NGOs and the public — as well as mitigating the physical risks of
climate change. Our net zero carbon route map sets out how we plan to address our operational
emissions during the 2020s and signal the need for tackled embodied carbon emissions, recognising
the continuing work being done to address our emissions increasing over last year.

Wessex Water Services Ltd 124

Climate-related Financial Disclosures

Implications for the Company's strategy and finances

Climate change and decarbonisation considerations are among the many factors that influence our
strategic and financial planning. Specifically, physical climate risks inform the functional plans (e.g.
our 25-year water resources and drainage and wastewater management plans) underpinning our
business plans that set out the investment we will undertake to maintain or enhance the services we
provide. These investments are dominated by regulatory requirements. Costed plans for
decarbonisation are part of our 2024 business plan submission. There are market or fiscal drivers
behind some of the investment required; but where these are absent (e.g. nitrous oxide emissions),
justification for the necessary expenditure must be based on the extent of the environmental impact.

We are increasingly looking at whole life carbon impacts, with an additional focus on the embodied
carbon of capital projects and consumables. This is already part of our annual reporting and also
featured in our 2024 business plan and future investment appraisal. It is clear, however, that a large
investment programme to improve river quality will have a significant carbon footprint if it is
dominated by conventional solutions such as storm tanks.

The most significant climate-related financial impacts are likely to result from disruption caused by
extreme weather events. In the short term these can take various forms, for example: ;

. heatwaves that increase water demand: necessary use of water sources with the highest
unit costs of treatment, plus additional pumping costs.

° extreme rainfall: costs associated with responding to localised site flooding, additional
water treatment at sources affected by runoff and leaching, and additional pumping in
the sewerage network.

We estimate the extreme rainfall in 2023-24 added circa £3-4m to our operating costs during the
year. In the longer term we expect the financial impact to grow in real terms, as extreme weather
events become more frequent, and pressure grows to maintain resilient services. We expect very
large associated investment i.e. £400m during 2025-30 to reduce storm overflow discharge
frequency and volume, and a range of supply and demand-side measures that will allow us to reduce .
abstraction by 20% by 2050, with most of the reductions happening by 2035. In both cases the long-
term impacts of climate change are not the sole contributor, but are nonetheless part of our
modelling.

The financial effects of our planned decarbonisation work were factored into our 2024 business plan
submission. There will be a wide range of marginal abatement costs across the potential measures
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This reflects the maturity of the technologies involved, the
makeup of the supply chain, and the changing economics of the default, traditional approach.
Overall, our direction of travel is to internalise carbon costs, and we will prioritise options that are
impactful, best value on a whole life cost basis, or preferably both.

Dependencies upon unproven technologies

Our transition plans are based on a range of technologies. Many are readily available and operating
at scale — especially in relation to energy and transport. However, some options are still in
development, or not yet readily available in the UK utilities sector. These include:

. availability of low carbon versions of heavy goods vehicles required to carry/tow loads;

° robust cost-effective and scalable advanced thermal conversion of sewage sludge;

° ammonia recovery as way to reduce treatment energy while producing a hydrogen
carrying substance; and .

. low carbon concrete and steels, where ‘grey’ solutions are required.

3. Risk management

Identifying and Assessing Risk

We prioritise investment or other action to address risk of any nature according to the likelinood and
consequence of the hazard occurring, further information is provided on pages 97 to 114. For
climate-related risks, our thinking is also informed by the UK Climate Projections, the UK Climate
Risk Assessment, the findings of the IPCC and the National Adaptation Plan. We also use an
inventory of UK water sector-specific climate hazards for our wider climate risk assessments
presented in our climate change adaptation report.

The UK Climate Projections (UKCP 18) provides the most up-to-date assessment of how the climate
of the UK may change over the 21st century. It provides data based on:

. different levels of probability;

° four emissions scenarios based on the representative concentration pathways (RCPs)
used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC); and

. several overlapping time periods to cover the 21% century.

We use UKCP18 outcomes to inform the 25-year long-term delivery strategies (Water Resources
Management Plan and the Drainage and Wastewater Management Plan) as part of the 2024 price
review and provide the context for the proposed investment during an initial period of 2025-30. The
strategies refer to common reference scenarios for climate change, technology, demand, and
abstraction reductions with a benign (RCP2.6) and adverse (RCP 8.5) version of each, analogous
to the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases that would result from low and high emissions
globally.

UKCP18 outputs

The table and chart below summarise UKCP18 projections (between the low emissions RCP2.6
pathway and the high emissions RCP8.5 pathway) for changes to average rainfall and summer
temperature in our region, relative to a 1961-90 reference period.

Future average rainfall: % change vs 1961-1990 reference period

Overlying these trends, during short term time horizons we expect a lot of variation from one year to
the next. Moreover, the resilience of our services is affected more by extreme weather events - such
as heatwaves, droughts, intense storm events and prolonged rainfall - than by changes to averages.
As background warming takes place, weather events previously considered extreme or unusual are
likely to occur more frequently. This is the most critical issue for our resilience and adaptability.

Our experience dealing with acute weather-related impacts helps us factor them into our planning
activities and company risk assessments. Notabie examples include:

« summer 1995 - the driest summer since 1911 and the driest three-month period since
1938. Efforts to reduce leakage were stepped up following this event;

e the prolonged rainfall of summer 2007 that required widespread emergency response and
led to a fundamental national review of surface water management;

e the heavy rainfall of 2012, with the wettest summer since 1911, followed a year later by
the wettest three-month period since 1911 from December 2013 to February 2014;

e the 2018 ‘Beast from the East’ cold wave and the subsequent thaw which caused
widespread outbreaks of leaks and pipe bursts; and

e Heatwaves in 2021 and 2022, the second of which coincided with the driest January to
August period since 1976.

e The wettest 18 month sequence on record culminating in March 2024.

Further details can be found in pages 5-7 of our climate change adaptation report.

Climate-related risks will affect the reliability and quality of the services we provide to customers and
communities, and place greater stress on water environment. This in turn will likely lead to greater
pressure on our activities.

Principal Climate-related Risks
Water resources - quantity

Acute heatwaves lead to peaks in water demand which can challenge the throughput and capacity
of water treatment and distribution. Droughts reduce yields from groundwater and reservoirs; while
we have not had to impose restrictions since 1976 to maintain public water supplies, droughts lead
to pressure to reduce abstraction to protect the freshwater environment and alleviate low river flows.

Wessex Water Services Ltd 127

Climate-related Financial Disclosures

Detailed climate risk assessments are carried out for our Water Resources Management Plans, for
which climate change scenario are an integral part. We estimate the impact of changing rainfall,
evaporation and temperature patterns and the impact that these may have on river flows, reservoirs,
groundwater recharge and ultimately on deployable output; and impacts on water demand. Our most
recent water supply vulnerability assessment included the following conclusions:

e the impact of the median impact climate change scenario on deployable output was low
for both the dry year annual average and dry year critical period scenarios;

e the baseline impact of climate change in the 2080's is estimated at -3.69 Ml/d on average
(1% of base year deployable output) and +1.07 Mi/d for the peak scenario (0.2% of base
year deployable output); and

« — by 2045, the increase in overall consumption resulting from climate change amounts to
1.7 Mi/d representing a small proportion of overall distribution input (c. 0.5%).

We are supporting research projects to improve our modelling of the relationship between weather
and demand. Such models may be driven with climate forecast changes to weather conditions in the
future, leading to revised predictions of climate change impacts on demand.

Water resources - quality

Extreme wet conditions can increase turbidity in water sources, while warm or dry conditions can
lead to reductions in quality due to biological activity. Our experience also shows that heavy rainfall
— both in prolonged episodes or short, sharp spells — can result in contaminants being washed into
reservoirs or groundwater sources. Past episodes have given rise to high levels of nitrates in relation
to extremely wet autumn and winter conditions.

Sewerage, sewage treatment and sludge

The highest risks for our wastewater activities relate to inundation of sewers during intense or
prolonged rainfall, with adverse impacts on customers and receiving watercourses. Others include
odour during warm weather; reduced dilution in receiving waters during drought leading to tighter
end-of-pipe standards at water recycling centres; and sedimentation in sewers, also due to drought.
Because of these risks, climate change impact assessments are increasingly used in wastewater
investment planning, such as the drainage and wastewater management plans. Overall, with a
changing climate and an increase in impermeable areas connected to the sewer system, we need
to make sure that our pipes have sufficient capacity to cope.

Climate change projections and assessments of risk involve recognised uncertainties, including:

e the future return period of unpredictable extreme weather events such as multi-season
droughts;

* — future emissions, atmospheric greenhouse gases concentration, and the pace of climate
change; .

e the specific influence of climate change for issues such as flooding and water demand
where there are many factors involved;

« the costs and benefits of adaptation options and the suitability of the measures we choose;
and

e the potential for new issues.

Further details can be found in appendix 5 of our climate change adaptation report.

Transition Risks

While the UK transition to a low carbon economy presents several opportunities, there are some
evident risks in relation to energy use and our greenhouse gas emissions. Most of these risks are
expressing themselves in the short to medium term (i.e. under five years), shaped by current policy
and economic factors, although we expect them to persist and intensify in the longer term.

Energy use

Since the late 1990s our electricity use increased by 40% due to higher effluent quality standards
(which often require energy intensive treatment such as mechanical aeration and ultraviolet
disinfection), and the need for a more resilient water supply network. Concerted energy efficiency
work has been necessary to prevent even higher energy use. Our electricity consumption is also
extremely sensitive to the weather. High rainfall increases the volume of sewage moving through
our sewerage network, and heatwaves increase public water demand and the energy required for
treating and pumping water. With the backdrop of this and higher energy prices, the economic and
financial rationale for self-generation is more compelling. Renewable energy use from our own
appointed business source in 2023-24 amounted to 17 gigawatt hours of electricity and 104 gigawatt
hours of biomethane, providing financial benefits in terms of sold energy and reduced energy
purchase, as well as the subsidies that are offered.

Regulatory

Through a performance commitment agreed with Ofwat, we pay customers £19,500 for every
kilotonne of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions if we exceed our annual target. Carbon footprint
reporting is also required for our Annual Report to Ofwat; for Streamlined Energy and Carbon
Reporting and as part of the UK Emissions Trading Scheme. Our annual reporting to Ofwat extend
to embodied carbon emissions in 2022-23. From 2025 there will be a common greenhouse gas
emissions performance commitment for water. companies in England and Wales, with an expanded
list of items being included (affecting scope 3 in particular) and a fixed emission factor for scope 2.

Market/investor pressures

We are seeing more interest in our carbon footprint, than has been the case historically, from
institutional investors, fund managers and ratings agencies. In response we provide disclosures via
the Carbon Disclosure Project, and information to our parent company, YTL Power, to meet the
listing requirements of Bursa Malaysia.

Customers and other stakeholders

The DESNZ public attitudes tracker shows that concern about climate change has risen steadily
over the last ten years. In the most recent survey (winter 2023-24), 81% of people said they are
concerned about climate change, with 43% saying they are “very concerned”. Its summer survey
showed that 21% of respondents expect the UK’s transition to a low carbon economy will have a
positive impact in 1-2 years, and 52% think it will have a positive impact in 10 years or more.
Alongside, a survey conducted in autumn 2021 by Business in the Community and YouGov (The
Right Climate For Business: leading a just transition), 72% of respondents said it is important that
the businesses they buy from take climate action. We believe that there will be growing expectation
that we reduce our carbon footprint and increase our resilience to climate risks, alongside other
areas of environmental delivery.

Quantification of emissions

Our quantification of emissions is aligned to UK water sector practice, which continues to evolve.
While the process is relatively mature there remain some important challenges, which are explained
in 4. Metrics and Targets.

Typically, the climate-related risks that we have identified are convergent with our core services and
activities and their associated KPIs. Also, climate change acts as a threat multiplier, rather than an
entirely free-standing set of risks.

The table provides a summary of control measures and actions to manage climate-related physical
risks. The risks selected here are those profiled in the 2022 UK Climate Change Risk Assessment

Climate-related Financial Disclosures

Looking ahead, decarbonisation of the UK electric grid and of road vehicles by 2030 will reduce our

emissions but these would be insufficient for reaching net zero emissions. We will need to pursue a
wide range of opportunities for cutting carbon that will require additional effort and investment
(especially during 2025-30). These will include some readily available options, using established
methods and known technologies, which have a favourable balance of costs and carbon reduction
benefits. Beyond these are more innovative options involving emerging science and technology; it
is likely that these will need to play a part if we are to achieve a net zero carbon position.

Integration of climate-related risks into the Company’s resilience

Our resilience action plan (approved by the Audit and Risk Committee) aligns with Ofwat’s concept
of ‘Resilience in the Round’ and considers the resilience of our operational, corporate, and financial
systems. Our resilience approach will allow us to focus our effort on the areas where improvement
is needed to maintain or strengthen our resilience.

We conduct horizon scanning to identify emerging shocks and stresses; climate change is one of
the ten stresses identified in our resilience action plan and is linked to some of the shocks such as
power failure, extreme weather, and flooding. We manage risk at strategic, tactical, and operational
levels, each of which involves resilience assessments. Climate change scenarios and extreme
weather events contribute to these, such as the analyses underlying our Water Resource
Management Plan and Drainage and Wastewater Management Plan.

We use a hierarchy of interventions to systematically encourage the development of mitigations
which are appraised using a capitals-based service measures framework. We have developed this
framework to capture and understand the risk to service and value of investing to our customers,
environment, and operations. In this way we aim to ensure that our investment decisions can deliver
against our Performance Commitments and resilience metrics.

4... Metrics and targets
Climate related metrics

Our climate related performance commitments and key performance indicators relate to our strategic
objectives as set out in our strategic direction, which in turn are related to customers’ priorities, and
statutory objectives for the environment and social provision as transposed into regulation.

We published our net zero carbon route map in Summer 2021 setting out options for achieving net
zero operational emissions, monitored by our operational carbon reporting. Our emission trajectory
has been downwards in that last ten years; however, much of this has been due to decarbonisation
of UK grid electricity, as well as our own efforts. Consequently, we are looking closely at other
solutions and techniques, e.g., nitrous oxide from sewage treatment. Further decarbonisation of our
activities will need to align with other environmental priorities to promote sustainable land use,
protect biodiversity and the water environment, improve resource efficiency, and reduce air pollution.
This in turn will benefit our customers and the communities we serve.

Performance commitments are agreed with our regulators and reported against annually in our
annual performance review. The main climate-related metrics include the following:

Targeted improvement for most of these is mainly driven by other environmental and social factors
@.g., customer experience, river ecology — but our assumption is that success in managing each
contributes to our resilience in the face of climate change.

Performance against these and other performance commitments are focused on environmental and
social delivery and do contribute to performance related pay and bonus arrangements, monitored by
the Remuneration Committee. ,

Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions

We use a well-established process for reporting greenhouse gas emissions, being the UK water
sector's carbon accounting workbook commissioned by UK Water Industry Research (UKWIR). The
workbook is updated annually with emission factors issued by the government and periodic updates
of sector-specific emission factors from other sources such as research and industry databases. It
is aligned with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and with substantive updates has included more scope
3 items.

Data challenges

We are confident in the level of emissions related to energy and transport. However, emissions of
methane and nitrous oxide (within scope 1) are much less certain, as they are estimated by water
companies in the absence of direct measurement methods. Work is underway nationally to better
quantify methane and nitrous oxide, and initial findings suggest that historically they have been
under-estimated. Looking ahead, it is probable that the emission factor for nitrous oxide emitted
from every kilogramme of nitrogen in the sewage that we receive, will be revised upwards. A
literature review carried out in 2020 for UK Water Industry Research, and the base assumptions
used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, suggest that a more accurate estimate of
nitrous oxide emissions overall could be four times higher than currently reported. Monitoring work
underway by UK water and sewerage companies is providing more accurate estimates of nitrous
oxide emissions at water recycling centres; future revisions to emissions factors for different types
of treatment process will result in the need to revise our own historical and forecast carbon footprint.

Emissions associated with construction materials and products and services that we consume via
our supply chain are uncertain. We are working to gain a better high-level understanding of these
scope 3 emissions, acknowledging that the calculations involved often carry many assumptions and
estimates. For example, the carbon footprint of one tonne of steel or cement can vary substantially
depending on the types of energy used at the point of manufacture, and the distances involved in
the supply chain.

Reporting: our performance commitment

A customised methodology was agreed with Ofwat in 2019 for calculating performance in relation to
our bespoke performance commitment during 2020-25. This includes a fixed set of items within
scopes 1-3, a predetermined profile for grid electricity emission factors, and the use of the 2019
edition of UKWIR carbon accounting workbook throughout the period. The financial year 2024-25

will be the final year that we report using this method. ,

Reporting: other disclosures

Emissions for 2023-24 are shown on page 135, conforming with Ofwat's Annual Performance Report
framework that applies to all the companies that they regulate. This account also integrates
disclosures that fulfil the requirements of the Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting framework.
This produces a different figure to that of our bespoke performance commitment, as a greater
number of scope 3 categories are included.

All the emissions shown use location-based reporting and represent an April to March year as this
is consistent with the Company's regulatory performance reporting.

The company does not yet purchase certified renewable electricity from grid suppliers, and therefore
we are not yet providing market-based data in this report. We will continue to review this option at
future buying rounds.

Our emissions during 2023-24 increased by 10,789 tonnes compared with 2022-23. While multiple
factors have to be taken into account, certain aspects had a notable influence. In particular:

e Electricity consumption increased due to the unusually wet conditions which increases power
use in our wastewater activities. Although the carbon intensity of grid electricity fell, the net
effect was that our grid electricity emission increased by 2.6kt CO2e.

« natural gas consumption increased by 1 GWh;

* raw sludge volumes increased by 7 kt dry solids;

e diesel use increased by 0.7 million litres, mainly at wastewater and sludge sites;

e transport emissions increased by 533 tCO2e.

We are seeing the growth of scope 3 in accounting terms, as items have been added to our
regulatory reporting as per the previous table. This acts as an upward pressure on our baseline
position. Moreover, it should also be noted that the inventory of items reported here is longer than
those included in our 2030 target (as detailed in section 2).

Assurance

Assurance of our reported data is provided by our technical auditor, Mott MacDonald, as part of the
assurance process for our annual performance review and regulated performance commitments.

1 The items included in our operational emissions reported below were expanded in 2022-23. This is a result of Ofwat
increasing the number of scope 1 items to be included in regulatory reporting within the annual performance report, with
the following being added: well-to-tank factors for electricity generation, electricity transmission and distribution, and
purchased fuels; treatment chemicals; and re-use of biosolids on third party land.

2 A scope 3 capital carbon figure was included for whole life carbon estimates for our PR24 business plan submission.

3 The 2022-23 figure for treatment chemicals and capital-projects have been corrected. The former correction has resulted
in a correction of the 2022-23 gross and net operational emissions figures also.

4 We report two intensity metrics, dividing the emissions associated with water supply and wastewater activities by water
put into the supply network and received via sewerage respectively. Both have been trending downwards over time, but
the wastewater intensity metric is highly weather dependent; i.e. a higher volume of rainfall received results in a lower
figure for emissions per megalitre.

Targets

In 2019 we announced our aim to achieve net zero operational emissions by 2030 and net zero total
emissions by 2040. This applies to Wessex Water Services Limited and the emissions associated
with its appointed activities.

The 2030 aim is based on the items within scope in 2019:

e Scope 1: burning of fossil fuels; process emissions; company vehicles

« Scope 2: purchased electricity (generation)

« Scope 3: purchased electricity (transmission & distribution); business travel; outsourced
activities.

Our 2030 aim is not a science-based target, but we consider it to be aligned with the principles of
the Paris Agreement and the United Nations Convention on Climate Change 1.5°C pathway. Our
targets and planning are also contextualised by the UK’s 2050 net zero aims and successive national
carbon budgets. ‘

We have not undertaken any carbon offsetting to date and buying carbon offsets would be a last
resort, although we cannot entirely discount this approach. Even with full pursuit of the options
available to us, we are likely to have residual emissions in 2030 — especially related to nitrous oxide
and methane emitted from sewage and sludge treatment. This is true under all forms of carbon
accounting, whether corporate carbon accounting with items being added to scope 3 reporting, or a
fixed-in-time reporting as per the initial commitment made in 2019 as part of the Public Interest
Commitment. If offsetting were unavoidable we would favour schemes that offer benefits for
biodiversity and local communities as well as carbon reduction, such as nature-based projects in our
region, or more innovative approaches such as coastal wetland creation or restoration, or storage in
marine vegetation such as sea grass. We will engage-with our customers and other stakeholders on
the topic of carbon offsetting to understand their viewpoints.

Directors’ Report

Directors’ report

The Directors have pleasure in presenting their report and the audited financial statements
(subsequently referred to as accounts) for the year to 30 June 2024.

The Directors consider the annual report taken as a whole, to be fair, balanced and understandable
and it provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s position and
performance, business model and strategy.

In reaching decisions the Board, individually and collectively, takes account of the requirements of
s.172 of Companies Act 2006 and the impact of decisions on the Company’s stakeholders.

Principal activities

The main activities of the Company are the supply of water and the treatment and disposal of waste
water. .

Results

The trading results for the year ended 30 June 2024 and the Company's financial position at that
period end are shown in the attached financial statements. The Company has generated revenue of
£598.8m during the year (2023: £541.8m) resulting in a loss before taxation of £25.1m (2023: Loss
of £35.4m). For further detail on the results for the year see page 36.

The Directors consider the trading performance for the year to be adequate and they are confident
of the future prospects of the Company.

Going concern

An overview of the business activities of Wessex Water Services Limited is given in the Strategic
Report on pages 2 to 52. A review of the principal risks that the company faces is given in the risk
management section on pages 97 to 114. The debt facilities available at the year end date, amounts
outstanding and the maturity profile of this debt are shown in note 18.

The Company meets its day-to-day working capital requirements and medium and long term funding
requirements through the cash and short term deposits described in note 17 and the facilities
described in note 18. Prior to the year end date the Company secured a £300m loan facility for 12
months with an option for the company to extend the loan for a further 6 months and the undrawn
revolving credit facilities referenced in note 18 were increased to £300m with a maturity date of June
2027, both reflecting the Company's ability to secure finance. Under some of the facilities the
Company is required to comply with an interest cover and gearing covenant tested quarterly and the
covenants remain the same in the new facilities.

The Directors have considered the financial position of the Company and cash flow forecasts for the
period from the date of approval of these Financial Statements through 31 December 2025 (the
going concern review period) and have concluded they will be able to meet their liabilities as they
fall due and comply with the covenants for the going concern review period. In coming to this
conclusion, the directors have evaluated the impact of the ‘cost of living’ crisis on revenues and debt
collectability, the repayment of loans maturing in the going concern review period and the required
future financing requirements of the company and Ofwat’s announcement of the PR24 draft
determination and the company’s subsequent re-submission in August 2024, which is available on
the Company's website at https://corporate.wessexwater.co.uk/our-future/business-plan-2025-
2030/updates-to-our-business-plan-2025-30. .

Wessex Water Services Ltd 137

Directors’ Report

The Directors have noted there is further debt falling due for repayment within the going concern
period, in particular £50m of European Investment Bank loan due in May 2025 and the new loan
facility referred to above that, if extended, will mature at the end of December 2025. The Directors
have considered the consistently strong operating performance, market experience for the company
and other water companies, the current leverage and credit rating of the bonds and a successful
history of issuing bonds and raising debt over the past 20 years, most recently the bond issued in
November 2023 and the new loan facilities obtained as noted above.

Based on this consideration, as well as the time period available to raise the required funding, the
Directors are satisfied that the issuance of debt included within the forecasts for the going concern
period to repay the new facility and finance the capital programme over the period is achievable. In
. order to facilitate the future issuance of bonds the Company established a £5bn Euro medium-term
note programme on 6 September 2023. The first issuance under the programme having taken place
in November 2023. The programme has since been renewed on 6 September 2024.

On the assumption that the required funding described above will be successfully raised by the
company for the reasons noted above, the Directors have considered a severe but plausible
downside scenario, to assess the impact on covenant compliance through the going concern review
period. This includes considering the impact of adverse macroeconomic factors including sustained
lower inflation combined with lower consumption and operational events such as asset and customer
service failures leading to regulatory enforcement. In addition, we have considered regulatory
impacts such as the ongoing Ofwat price and tariff review, i.e. PR24, covering the period from April
2025 to March 2030. In situations requiring mitigations to be deployed, the Company could reduce
discretionary expenditure, defer capital expenditure and/or cancel non-essential capital expenditure,
reduce the amount of dividend payable and raise additional finance.

Accordingly, after considering the forecasts, appropriate sensitivities, available facilities and the
ability to raise additional debt, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has
adequate resources to continue in operational existence and to comply with its financial covenants
for the going concern review period through to 31 December 2025; therefore, the Directors continue
to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Financial Statements.

workbook is updated annually with emission factors issued by the government and has had periodic
updates of sector-specific emission factors from other sources such as research and industry ©
databases.

Emissions for 2023-24 are shown on page 135. All the emissions shown use location-based
reporting and represent an April to March year as this is consistent with the Company’s regulatory
performance reporting.

Notes to the financial statements
1. Accounting policies
1.1 Basis of preparation

Wessex Water Services Limited (the ‘Company’) is a private company incorporated, domiciled and
registered in England in the UK. The registered number is 2366648 and the registered address is
Wessex Water Operations Centre, Claverton Down, Bath, BA2 7WW.

The Company financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in
accordance with UK adopted international accounting standards. These financial statements present
information for the company only as a single entity.

The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to
all periods presented in these financial statements.

Judgements made by the Directors, in the application of these accounting policies, that have
significant effect on the financial statements and estimates with a significant risk of material
adjustment in the next year are discussed in note 32.

These financial statements present information for the company only as a single entity.

1.2 Measurement convention

The financial statements are prepared on a cost basis and presented in pounds sterling which is the
company’s functional and presentational currency.

1.3 Going concern

An overview of the business activities of Wessex Water Services Limited is given in the Strategic
Report on pages 2 to 52. A review of the principal risks that the company faces is given in the risk
management section on pages 97 to 114. The debt facilities available at the year end date, amounts
outstanding and the maturity profile of this debt are shown in note 18.

The Company meets its day-to-day working capital requirements and medium and long term funding
requirements through the cash and short term deposits described in note 17 and the facilities
described in note 18. Prior to the year end date the Company secured a £300m loan facility for 12
months with an option for the company to extend the loan for a further 6 months and the undrawn
revolving credit facilities referenced in note 18 were increased to £300m with a maturity date of June
2027, both reflecting the Company’s ability to secure finance. Under some of the facilities the
Company is required to comply with an interest cover and gearing covenant tested quarterly and the
covenants remain the same in the new facilities.

The Directors have considered the financial position of the Company and cash flow forecasts for the
period from the date of approval of these Financial Statements through 31 December 2025 (the
going concern review period) and have concluded they will be able to meet their liabilities as they
fall due and comply with the covenants for the going concern review period. In coming to this
conclusion, the directors have evaluated the impact of the ‘cost of living’ crisis on revenues and debt
collectability, the repayment of loans maturing in the going concern review period and the required
future financing requirements of the company and Ofwat’s announcement of the PR24 draft
determination and the company’s subsequent re-submission in August 2024, which is available on
the Company's website at httos://corporate.wessexwater.co.uk/our-future/business-plan-2025-
2030/updates-to-our-business-plan-2025-30.

Wessex Water Services Ltd 148

1. Accounting policies (continued)

1.3 Going concern (continued)

The Directors have noted there is further debt falling due for repayment within the going concern
period, in particular £50m of European Investment Bank loan due in May 2025 and the new loan
facility referred to above that, if extended, will mature at the end of December 2025. The Directors
have considered the consistently strong operating performance, market experience for the company
and other water companies, the current leverage and credit rating of the bonds and a successful
history of issuing bonds and raising debt over the past 20 years, most recently the bond issued in
November 2023 and the new loan facilities obtained as noted above.

Based on this consideration, as well as the time period available to raise the required funding, the
Directors are satisfied that the issuance of debt included within the forecasts for the going concern
period to repay the new facility and finance the capital programme over the period is achievable. In
order to facilitate the future issuance of bonds. the Company established a £5bn Euro medium-term
note programme on 6 September 2023. The first issuance under the programme having taken place
in November 2023. The programme has since been renewed on 6 September 2024.

On the assumption that the required funding described above will be successfully raised by the
company for the reasons noted above, the Directors have considered a severe but plausible
downside scenario, to assess the impact on covenant compliance through the going concern review
period. This includes considering the impact of adverse macroeconomic factors including sustained
lower inflation combined with lower consumption and operational events such as asset and customer
service failures leading to regulatory enforcement. In addition, we have considered regulatory
impacts such as the ongoing Ofwat price and tariff review, i.e. PR24, covering the period from April
2025 to March 2030. In situations requiring mitigations to be deployed, the Company could reduce
discretionary expenditure, defer capital expenditure and/or cancel non-essential capital expenditure,
reduce the amount of dividend payable and raise additional finance.

Accordingly, after considering the forecasts, appropriate sensitivities, available facilities and the
ability to raise additional debt, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has
adequate resources to continue in operational existence and to comply with its financial covenants
for the going concern review period through to 31 December 2025; therefore, the Directors continue
to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Financial Statements.

1.4 Foreign currency

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at
the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the
balance sheet date are retranslated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at
that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income
statement.

Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency
are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.

Wessex Water Services Ltd 149

1. Accounting policies (continued)

1.5 Financial instruments
Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and bank deposits. Bank overdrafts that are
repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Company's cash management are included
as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose only of the cash flow statement.

Financial assets
Initial recognition and measurement

Financial assets are classified, at initial recognition, as subsequently measured at amortised cost,
fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI), and fair value through profit or loss.

The classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the financial asset’s contractual
cash flow characteristics and the Company’s business model for managing them. With the exception
of trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which the Company
has applied the practical expedient. The Company initially measures a financial asset at its fair value
plus transaction costs. Trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or
for which the Company has applied the practical expedient are measured at the transaction price
determined under IFRS 15.

In order for a financial asset to be classified and measured at amortised cost or fair value through
OCI, it needs to give rise to cash flows that are ‘solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI)’ on
the principal amount outstanding. This assessment is referred to as the SPPI test and is performed
at an instrument level. -

The Company’s business model for managing financial assets refers to how it manages its financial
assets in order to generate cash flows. The business model determines whether cash flows will
result from collecting contractual cash flows, selling the financial assets, or both.

Subsequent measurement
Financial assets at amortised cost (debt instruments)

This category is the most relevant to the Company. The Company measures financial assets at
amortised cost if both of the following conditions are met:
e the financial asset is held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets
in order to collect contractual cash flows, and;
e the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are
solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding

Financial assets at amortised cost are subsequently measured using the effective interest (EIR)
method and are subject to expected credit loss. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss
when the asset is derecognised, modified or impaired.

The Company's financial assets at amortised cost includes intercompany loans repayable in more
than 12 months, and trade receivables.

Derecognition

A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial
assets) is primarily derecognised (i.e., removed from the Company's statement of financial position)
when:

* the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or;

Wessex Water Services Ltd 150

1. Accounting policies (continued)

1.5 Financial instruments (continued)

e the Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed
an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under
a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; and either (a) the Company has transferred substantially all
the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Company has neither transferred nor retained
substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset

Financial liabilities
Initial recognition and measurement

Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit
or loss, loans and borrowings, payables, as appropriate.

All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings
and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.

The Company's financial liabilities include trade and other payables and loans and borrowings.
Subsequent measurement — loans and borrowings

This is the category most relevant to the Company. After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans
and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. Gains and
losses are recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the
EIR amortisation process.

Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees
or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the
statement of profit or loss.

This category generally applies to interest-bearing loans and borrowings. For more information, refer
to note 18.

Derecognition

A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled
or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on
substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an
exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition
of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the statement
of profit or loss.

1.6 Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated
impairment losses. :

Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are
accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.

Leases in which the Company assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the
leased asset are classified as finance leases. Where land and buildings are held under leases the
accounting treatment of the land is considered separately from that of the buildings.

Wessex Water Services Ltd 151

1. Accounting policies (continued)

1.6 Property, plant and equipment (continued)

Leased assets acquired by way of finance lease are stated at an amount equal to the lower of their
fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less
accumulated depreciation and less accumulated impairment losses.

Under IAS16 sewers adopted at nil cost to the Company are included in property, plant and
equipment at a fair value, which is the estimated cost of construction and depreciated at the same
rate as infrastructure assets.

Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment. Land is not depreciated. The estimated
useful lives are as follows:

e land and buildings 10 to 80 years
e _ infrastructure assets 60 to 200 years
e plant, equipment and motor vehicles 2 to 30 years

e — office and IT equipment 3 to 10 years

Infrastructure assets comprise these eight components:

Impounding reservoirs 150 years, raw water mains 100 years, treated water mains 100 years,
communication pipes 60 years, sewers 200 years, sewage pumping stations 60 years, combined
sewer overflows 80 years and sea outfalls 60 years.

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each balance sheet date.

1.7 Intangible assets

Intangible assets that are acquired by the company are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation
and less accumulated impairment losses.

Amortisation

Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
lives of intangible assets unless such lives are indefinite. Intangible assets with an indefinite useful
life are systematically tested for impairment at each balance sheet date. Other intangible assets are
amortised from the date they are available for use. The estimated useful lives are as follows:

e Specialised computer software 10 years
e In-house computer software development 5. years
e« Other computer software 3 years

1.8 Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is based on the first-in first-
out principle and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories, production or conversion
costs and other costs in bringing them to their existing location and condition. In the case of
manufactured inventories and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of overheads
based on normal operating capacity.

Wessex Water Services Ltd 152

1. Accounting policies (continued)

1.9 Impairment excluding inventories and deferred tax assets
Financial assets (including receivables)

For trade receivables and contract assets that are expected to have a maturity of one year or less,
the Company has applied the practical expedient and followed the simplified approach in calculating
ECLs. Therefore, the Company does not track changes in credit risk, but instead recognises a loss
allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date. The Company has established a provision
matrix that is based on its historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors
specific to the debtors and the economic environment.

The provision rates are based on days past due for groupings of various customer segments that
have similar loss patterns (i.e., customer type, payment method, rating and coverage by letters of
credit and other forms of credit insurance).

The provision matrix is initially based on the Company’s historical observed default rates. The
Company will calibrate the matrix to adjust the historical credit loss experience with forward-looking
information. For instance, if forecast economic conditions (i.e., average earnings) are expected to
deteriorate over the next year which can lead.to an increased number of defaults in the sector, the
historical default rates are adjusted. At every reporting date, the historical observed default rates are
updated and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed.

The assessment of the correlation between historical observed -default rates, forecast economic
conditions and ECLs is a significant estimate. The amount of ECLs is sensitive to changes in
circumstances and of forecast economic conditions. The Company's historical credit loss experience
and forecast of economic conditions may also not be representative of customer's actual default in
the future. The information about the ECLs on the Company's trade receivables and contract assets
is disclosed in Note 25.

The Company considers. a financial asset in default when contractual payments are 80 days past
due. However, in certain cases, the Company may also consider a financial asset to be in default
when internal or external information indicates that the Company is unlikely to receive the
outstanding contractual amounts in full before taking into account any credit enhancements held by
the Company. A financial asset is written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering
the contractual cash flows.

Non-financial assets

The carrying amounts of the Company's non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred
tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of
impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. For
goodwill, and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives or that are not yet available for use,
the recoverable amount is estimated each year at the same time.

The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use and its
fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted
to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the
time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.

Wessex Water Services Ltd 153

1. Accounting policies (continued)

1.10 Employee benefits
Defined benefit plans

A defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan. The
Company's net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans and other post-employment
benefits are calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in
return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its
present value, and the fair value of any plan assets are deducted. The Company determines the net
interest on the net defined benefit jiability for the period by applying the discount rate used to
measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the net defined benefit
liability.

The discount rate is the yield at the reporting date on bonds that have a credit rating of at least AA
that have maturity dates approximating the terms-of the Company's obligations and that are
denominated in the currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid.

Re-measurements arising from defined benefit plans comprise actuarial gains and losses and the
return on plan assets. The Company recognises them immediately in other comprehensive income
and all other expenses related to defined benefit plans in employee benefit expenses in profit or loss.

When the benefits of a plan are changed, or when a plan is curtailed, the portion of the changed
benefit related to past service by employees, or the gain or loss on curtailment, is recognised
immediately in profit or loss when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs.

The calculation of the defined benefit obligations is performed by a qualified actuary using the
projected unit credit method. When the calculation results in a benefit to the Company, the
recognised asset is limited to the present value of benefits available in the form of any future refunds
from the plan or reductions in future contributions and takes into account the adverse effect of any
minimum funding requirements.

The Company’s employees are members of the Wessex Water Ltd Group pension scheme. The
Company recognizes a cost equal to its contribution payable for the period. The assets of the scheme
are held separately from those of the Group. The scheme has been closed to new members since
2009.

Defined contribution plans

A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which the Company pays fixed
contributions into a separate entity and will have no-legal or constructive obligation to pay further
amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an
expense in the income statement in the periods during which services are rendered by employees.

Short-term benefits

Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed
as the related service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under
short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Company has a present legal or constructive
obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation
can be estimated reliably.

Wessex Water Services Ltd 154

1. Accounting policies (continued)

1.11 Provisions

A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Company has a present legal or constructive
obligation as a result of a past event, that can be reliably measured, and it is probable that an outflow
of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by
discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects risks specific to the liability.

1.12 Deferred grants and contributions

Grants and contributions in respect of specific expenditure on non-infrastructure property, plant and
equipment are treated as contract liability and recognised in the income statement over the expected
useful economic lives of the related assets.

1.12 Deferred grants and contributions (continued)

Grants and contributions relating to infrastructure assets are amortised over the appropriate useful
economic life (see 1.6).

Sewers adopted at nil cost to the Company are shown in deferred income at a fair value, which is
the estimated cost of construction, and amortised at the same rate as infrastructure assets are
depreciated.

1.13 Revenue
Supply of water and sewerage services

The nature of the water industry in the UK is such that revenue recognition is subject to a degree of
estimation. The assessment of water sales to customers is based on internal data where final
settlement data is not yet available. At the end of each period, amounts of water delivered to
customers are estimated and the corresponding billed and unbilled revenue is assessed and
recorded in Revenue. For the purpose of the judgement various factors are considered such as
seasonality, historic billing profiles, leakage data and general economic conditions.

The company, under the license granted by the Government, has the right to supply water and
sewerage services to customers, together with an obligation to maintain and develop the network
and ensure its continued availability. Revenue from contracts with customers is recognised when
control of these goods or services are transferred to the customer at an amount that reflects the
consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.

For metered customers this amount is determined by the meter reading. For unmetered customers,
the amount to which the Company has a right to receive is determined by the passage of time during
which the customer occupies a property within the Company’s licensed region. Revenue represents
income receivable in the ordinary course of business, excluding VAT, for services provided. Revenue
is recognised to the extent that it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Company.

Variable consideration

Unbilled receivables are considered to be a variable consideration which is not constrained as the
Company considers it to be highly probable that a significant amount will not be reversed after year
end. Unbilled receivables and the variable consideration are estimated using the most likely outcome
approach.

Wessex Water Services Ltd 155

1. Accounting policies (continued)

1.13 Revenue (continued)
Other revenue - Developer Services

These are services related to the obligation under statute to allow property developers to establish
an authorised connection to the water and/or sewerage network. In obtaining the connection the
developer may require the Company to undertake one or more of the of the following:

(i) Connections and meter installation in exchange for payment;
(ii) Requisitions of water mains in exchange for payment; and
(iil) Adoptions of water and waste water mains.

The developer is also required to pay infrastructure charges being a contribution to network
reinforcement.

Period over which performance obligations are satisfied

From the perspective of the Company these activities are not separable nor distinct and instead form
a bundle of activities necessary to establish an authorised connection from which the network access
can be obtained. Also, the Company has an additional obligation under statute to keep the
connection in place for all current and future occupiers and facilitate ongoing access to the network
for as long as the property requires service provision. Consequently, revenue from Developer
Services will be deferred over the shorter of expected period of service provision or the need to
replace the assets at the end of their useful life (typically in the range 60 to 125 years).

Financing component

Under IFRS 15 the transaction price needs to be adjusted if the timing of payments provides the
customer or supplier with a significant benefit of financing the transfer of goods or services. This is
not the case for Developer Services as the timing difference does not arise as a result of the provision
of finance, but rather comes as a consequence of the nature of the regulatory environment.

Other Revenue - general

Other Revenue which includes income from related parties is recognised by reference to each
distinct performance obligation promised in the contract with customer. Depending on the
substances of the respective contract with the customer, revenue is recognised when the
performance obligation is satisfied, which may be at a point in time or over time.

1.14 Expenses

Operating lease payments

Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low value assets are recognised as expenses
on a Straight-line basis over the lease term.

IFRS16 lease payments

Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the
outstanding liability. The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to
produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Variable lease
payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as expenses. In addition,
depreciation is charged on a straight-line basis on a right-of-use asset recognised at the inception
of the lease (or the date of adoption of IFRS 16 if later).

Wessex Water Services Ltd 156

1. Accounting policies (continued)

1.14 Expenses (continued)
Financing income and expenses

Financing expenses comprise interest payable, finance charges on shares classified as liabilities
and finance leases recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method, unwinding of the
discount on provisions, and net foreign exchange losses that are recognised in the income statement
(see foreign currency accounting policy).

Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset
that takes a substantial time to be prepared for use, are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset.
Financing income comprises interest receivable on funds invested, dividend income, and net foreign
exchange gains.

Interest income and interest payable is recognised in profit or loss as it accrues, using the effective
interest method. Dividend income is recognised in the income statement on the date the entity's right
to receive payments is established. Foreign currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis.

1.15 Taxation

Tax on the profit for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income
statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it
is recognised in equity.

Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year,
using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to
tax payable in respect of previous years.

Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following
temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of
assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business
combination, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably
not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected
manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will
be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.

1.16 Dividends

Dividends are proposed by the Board and immediately afterwards are authorised by the shareholder
and are therefore recognised as a liability in the accounts until paid.

1.17 Contract balances

Contract assets

A contract asset is the right to consideration in exchange for goods or services transferred to the
customer. If the Company performs by transferring goods or services to a customer before the
customer pays consideration or before payment is due, a contract asset is recognised for the earned
consideration.

Wessex Water Services Ltd 157

°

1. Accounting policies (continued)

1.17 Contract balances (continued)
Contract liabilities

A contract liability is the obligation to transfer goods or'services to a customer for which the Company
has received consideration (or an amount of consideration is due) from the customer. If a customer
pays consideration before the Company transfers goods or services to the customer, a contract
liability is recognised when the payment is made, or the payment is due (whichever is earlier).
Contract liabilities are recognised as revenue when the Company performs under the contract.

1.18 Leases

The Company assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if
the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange
for consideration.

Company as a lessee

The Company applies a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases, except for
short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. The Company recognises lease liabilities to make
lease payments and right-of-use assets representing the right to use the underlying assets.

i) Right-of-use assets

The Company recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date
the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease
liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial
direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease
incentives received. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of
the lease term and the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows:

. land and buildings ; 4 to 97 years
. motor vehicles and other equipment 3.to 4 years

If ownership of the leased asset transfers to the Company at the end of the lease term or the cost
reflects the exercise of a purchase option, depreciation is calculated using the estimated useful life
of the asset. The right-of-use assets are also subject to impairment. Refer to the accounting policies
in section (1.9) Impairment of non-financial assets.

ii) Lease liabilities

At the commencement date of the lease, the Company recognises lease liabilities measured at the
present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed
payments (including in substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable
lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual
value guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option
reasonably certain to be exercised by the Company and payments of penalties for terminating the
lease, if the lease term reflects the Company exercising the option to terminate. Variable lease
payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as expenses (unless they are
incurred to produce inventories) in the period in which the event or condition that triggers the
payment occurs.

Wessex Water Services Ltd 158

1. Accounting policies (continued)

1.18 Leases (continued)

In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate
at the lease commencement date because the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily
determinable. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect
the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount
of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in
the lease payments (e.g., changes to future payments resulting from a change in an index or rate
used to determine such lease payments) or a change in the assessment of an option to purchase
the underlying asset.

The Company’s lease liabilities are included in Interest-bearing loans and borrowings (see Note 18).

iii) Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets

The Company applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases (i.e., those
leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain
a purchase option). It also applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption to leases that
are low value. Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low value assets are recognised
as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Company as a lessor

Leases in which the Company does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to
ownership of an asset are classified as operating leases. Rental income arising is accounted for on
a straight-line basis over the lease terms and is included in revenue in the statement of profit or loss
due to its operating nature. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating
lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised over the lease term on
the same basis as rental income. Contingent rents are recognised as revenue in the period in which
they are earned.

1.19 Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)

SaaS arrangements are service contracts providing the Company with the right to access the cloud
provider's application software over the contract period. Costs incurred to configure or customise,
and the ongoing fees to obtain access to the cloud provider's application software, are recognised
as operating expenses when the services are received.

Some of the costs incurred relate to the development of software code that enhances or modifies,
or creates additional capability to, existing on-premise systems and meets the definition of, and the
recognition criteria for, an intangible asset. These costs are recognised as intangible software assets
and amortised over the useful life of the software on a straight- line basis. The useful lives of these
assets are reviewed at least at the end of each financial year, and any change accounted for
prospectively as a change in accounting estimate.

1.20 Changes in accounting polices and disclosures

In the year, the Company adopted the amendments to IAS12 “Income Taxes” relating to
“International Tax Reform — Pillar Two Rules” issued by the International Standards Boards (IASB)
in May 2023. The amendments provide a temporary mandatory exception from recognising and
disclosing information about deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from the implementation of
Pillar Two model rules.

4. Revenue from contracts with customers (continued)

In accordance with IFRS 15, revenue has been disaggregated based on what is recognised in
relation to the core services of supplying clean water and the removing and treating of wastewater.
Each of these services is deemed to give rise to a distinct performance obligation under the contract
with customers, though following the same pattern of transfer to the customer who simultaneously
receives and consumes both of these services over time.

Residential retail charges relate solely to the margin applied to the wholesale amounts charged to
residential customers. The wholesale charges and retail margin are combined in arriving at the total
revenues relating to water and wastewater services provided to household customers.

Other revenue comprises a number of smaller non-core income streams including those relating to
activities, typically performed opposite property developers, which impact the Company’s capital
network assets including activities that facilitate the creation of an authorised connection through
which properties can obtain water and wastewater services.

Contract balances
Contract cost assets of £5.5m (2023: £5.9m) are included in the statement of financial position under

trade and other receivables, see note 16. At the year-end there were liabilities for receipts in advance
relating to contracts of £77.1m (2023: £71.9m), see note 19.

The statutory rate of Corporation tax of 25% has applied to the current year profits (2023: 20.5%).
The Company has benefited from the Full Expensing regime which has now been made
permanent. As a result, the Company has generated current year tax losses which have been
recognised as a deferred tax asset and offset against the existing deferred tax liabilities.

The Finance (No 2) Act 2023 was enacted in June 2023. This legislation includes the BEPS Pillar
Two legislation which will impact the Company's accounting period starting on 1 July 2024. The
Company is part of the wider YTL Group which operates across a number of jurisdictions some of
which are yet to implement the Pillar Two legislation, or some have only done so recently with an

effective start date of 1 January 2025.

Wessex Water Services Ltd 165

9. Taxation (continued)

As a result of the different effective start dates of the legislation, the Group is still in the process of
assessing the potential exposure to Pillar Two income taxes across the whole Group and its impact
is currently not known or reasonably estimable. However, considering the UK entity on a
standalone basis, the Company has performed an initial assessment based on the most recent
information available. Based on the assessment performed, the Company does not expect a
potential exposure to Pillar Two top-up taxes in the UK.

10. Dividends

The dividend policy is to declare dividends consistent with the Company's performance and
prudent management of the economic risk of the business.

Dividend payments are reviewed and approved on a quarterly basis by the Board after taking into
account both current and projected business performance.

In particular the Board takes into account:

e the company’s current and projected performance in delivering the level of service customers
expect from an efficient water and sewerage company and that where that level of service
has not been delivered, that customers have been adequately compensated

e that the company is delivering the required quality and environmental outputs and making
sufficient investment in its infrastructure to maintain and, where necessary, increase
resilience

e that the correct amount of tax has been paid .

e that the Company has met any unexpected additional expenditure needs that may have
arisen during the year to date, as new operational risks emerge

e the level of regulatory gearing and its comparison with Ofwat’s expectations pertaining at the
time

e the sufficiency of distributable reserves.

The company intends to maintain a solid investment grade credit rating at all times.

12. Leases
Company as a lessee

The Company has lease contracts for various items of property, plant, machinery, vehicles and other
equipment used in its operations. Leases of plant and machinery generally have lease terms
between 3 and 15 years, while motor vehicles and other equipment generally have lease terms
between 3 and 5 years. The Company's obligations under its leases are secured by the lessor’s title
to the leased assets. Generally, the Company is restricted from assigning and subleasing the leased
assets. There are several lease contracts that include extension and termination options and variable
lease payments, which are further discussed below.

The Company also has certain leases of machinery with lease terms of 12 months or less and leases
of office equipment with low value. The Company applies the ‘short-term lease’ and ‘lease of low-
value assets’ recognition exemptions for these leases. Set out below are the carrying amounts of
right-of-use assets recognised and the movements during the period:

During the year an impairment loss of £4.2m (2023: £nil) was recognised due to delays in the
completion of internally developing a Billing and Customer service platform. In assessing
impairment, management estimated the recoverable amount based on expected future cash flows
and used an appropriate discount rate of 4.45% based on the Company’s cost of capital.

The Company continues to evaluate how best to complete this software which includes evaluation
of an option to migrate this development to a ‘Software as a Service’ product. Whilst no decision
has currently been made to change from the original development plan, if a decision is made to
change to a ‘Software as a Service’ product existing costs of £12.5m would be fully expensed to

the income statement.

Trade receivables are expected to be recovered in no more than 12 months.

All outstanding related party receivable balances are owed on commercial terms and arise through
norma! business operations. The company has considered the present value of the contractual cash
flows and compared this to a prudent assessment of the present value of the cash flows that are
expected to be received. Having performed this assessment, the company has determined that no
material expected credit loss provisions are required as at year end for related party balances owed.

20. Retirement benefits (continued)

The company sponsors a funded defined benefit pension plan for qualifying UK employees, the
Wessex Water Pension Scheme. The scheme is administered by a separate board of trustees, which
is legally separate from the company. The trustees are composed of representatives of both the
employer and employees. The trustees are required by law to act in the interest of all relevant
beneficiaries and are responsible for the investment policy for the assets and the day-to-day
administration of the benefits.

Under the Scheme, employees are entitled to annual pensions on retirement using an accrual rate
and final pensionable salary for each year of service. Benefits are also payable on death and
following other events such as withdrawing from active service. No other post-retirement benefits
are provided to these employees. :

Liabilities for an unfunded arrangement and a compensatory payment for added years’ service are
held outside the defined benefit scheme. The Company also operates a defined contribution section
within the main pension scheme. During the year the Company paid £11.3m (2023: £9.1m) to the
defined contribution section and at 30 June 2024 owed £1.2m (2023: £0.9m).

Profile of the scheme

The Defined Benefit Obligation (DBO) includes benefits for current employees, former employees,
and current pensioners. Broadly, about 24% of the DBO is attributable to current employees, 14%
to deferred pensioners and 62% to current pensioners.

The scheme duration is an indicator of the weighted-average time until benefit payments are made.
For the scheme as a whole, the duration is approximately 13-14 years, reflecting the appropriate
split of defined benefit obligation between current employees (duration of c18-19 years), deferred
members (duration of c17-18 years) and current pensioners (duration of c10-11 years).

Funding requirements

UK legislation requires that pension schemes are funded prudently. The last funding valuation of the
scheme was carried out by a qualified actuary as at 30 September 2022 and showed a deficit of
£35.3m. The company paid £18.4m on 30 June 2023 which, along with investment returns from
return-seeking assets, has made good the shortfall. The next funding valuation is due no later than
30 September 2025, at which progress towards full-funding will be reviewed.

The Company also pays contributions of 15.5% of pensionable salaries in respect of current accrual
and non-investment related expenses.

Risks associated with the scheme

Asset volatility - The DBO is calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond
yields. If assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit.

The scheme holds a significant proportion of growth assets (equities, diversified growth fund and
global absolute return fund) which, though expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long-term,
create volatility and risk in the short-term. The allocation to growth. assets is monitored to ensure it
remains appropriate given the scheme's long-term objectives.

Wessex Water Services Ltd 176

20. Retirement benefits (continued)

Changes in bond yields — A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed on the
scheme's DBO for accounting purposes, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the
value of the scheme's bond holdings.

Inflation risk — The majority of the scheme’s DBO is linked to inflation, and higher inflation leads to a
higher DBO (although, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to
protect against extreme inflation).

Most of the assets are either unaffected by or only loosely correlated with inflation, meaning that an
increase in inflation will also increase the deficit.

Life expectancy — The majority of the scheme’s obligations are to provide benefits for the lifetime of
the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the DBO.

Virgin Media vs NTL Case

The Virgin Media Ltd v NTL Pension Trustees || decision, handed down by the High Court on 16
June 2023, considered the implications of section 37 Pension Schemes Act 1993. The Court of
Appeal upheld this ruling on 25 July 2024. The company will continue to investigate the possible
implications together with the trustees and its advisers, but as it stands, does not have cause to
believe that it will have any material impact on the Scheme.

Reporting at 30 June 2024

The results of the latest funding valuation at 30 September 2022 have been adjusted to the balance
sheet date taking account of experience over the period since 30 September 2022, changes in
market conditions, and differences in the financial and demographic assumptions. The present value
of the defined benefit obligation, and the related current service cost, were measured using the
Projected Unit Credit Method.

The principal assumptions used to calculate the liabilities under IAS 19 are set out below. The major
assumptions used by the actuary were:

30.06.24 30.06.23

Rate of increase in salaries — long term . 1.90% 1.90%
Rate of increase in pensions

- WWPS and 1/80ths members 2.90% 3.00%
- MIS members 2.60% 2.70%
- Reduced level members 2.00% 2.10%
- Post 88 GMP 2.10% 2.10%
Discount rate . 5.10% 5.20%
Inflation assumption — RPI 3.10% 3.20%
Inflation assumption ~ CPI 2.60% 2.70%

Wessex Water Services Ltd 177

20. Retirement benefits (continued)

Mortality assumptions:

The mortality assumptions are based upon the recent actual mortality experience of Scheme
members and allow for expected future improvements in mortality rates.

2024 2024 2023 2023
_ Male Female Male Female

years Years years Years
Life expectancy - current.age 60 25.4 28.2 25.6 28.3
Life expectancy - current age 40 46.6 49.4 46.8 49.4

The mortality table adopted is based upon 105% of standard tables S3P(M/F)A adjusted to allow for
individual years of birth. Future improvements are assumed to be in line with the CMI 2022
projection, with a long-term improvement rate of 1.0% p.a. for all members.

Members are assumed to take four times their pre-commutation pension as cash at retirement.

Sensitivity analysis .

The key assumptions used for IAS 19 are: discount rate, inflation and mortality. If different
assumptions are used, this could have a material effect on the results disclosed. The sensitivity of
the results to these assumptions are set out below. For the purposes of these sensitivities, it has
been assumed that the change in the discount rate and inflation has no impact on the value of
Scheme assets.

A reduction in the discount rate of 0.1% would increase the scheme liabilities by £7.3m from
£568.7m to £576.0m, reducing the scheme surplus to a deficit of £1.4m.

An increase in the inflation assumption of 0.1% would increase the scheme liabilities by £6.9m
from £568.7m to £575.6m, reducing the scheme surplus to a deficit of £1.0m.

An increase in life expectancy of 1 year would increase the scheme liabilities by £18.7m from
£568.7m to £587.4m, reducing the scheme surplus to a deficit of £12.8m.

The sensitivity information shown above has been prepared using the same method as
adopted when adjusting the results of the latest funding valuation to the balance sheet date.
This is the same approach as has been adopted in previous periods.

In the ordinary course of business, the Company is sometimes subject to claims and potential
litigation, whether from regulatory bodies, individuals or particular groups, related to one off
matters. The Directors consider that, where it is possible to be estimated reliably, a reasonable
and appropriate position has been taken in reflecting such items in these Financial Statements
in the note above. The provisions disclosed will be utilised with 12 months of 30 June 2024.

It is not currently possible to estimate the financial effect and likely timing of any associated
outflow of some matters, given that some are in early stages of discussion, the limited likelihood
of the claims against the Company being successful, or the potential range of possible
outcomes, and accordingly no provision has been made in the Financial Statements. No
reasonably possible financial outcome that would be significant to the Financial Statements has
been identified in relation to these remaining matters at the date of the issue of these Financial
Statements.

25. Financial instruments
(a) Fair values of financial instruments

Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms-length
transaction between informed and willing parties, other than a forced or liquidation sale. The fair
value of short term and floating rate borrowings approximate to book value. The fair value of long-
term fixed rate borrowings has been calculated using market values or discounted cash flow
techniques.

The IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy is a categorisation relating to the extent that the fair value can be
determined by reference to comparable market values. The hierarchy ranges from level 1 where
instruments are quoted on an active market through to level 3 where the assumptions used to derive
fair value do not have comparable market data.

The fair values of long-term fixed-rate inter-company borrowings are classified as level 1 in the IFRS
13 fair value hierarchy and have a carrying value of £1,589.7m and a fair value of £1,447.4m. The
fair values of long-term index-linked inter-company borrowings are classified as level 1 in the IFRS
13 fair value hierarchy and have a carrying value of £927.5m and a fair value of £934.8m. Bank
loans are classified as level 2 and have a carrying value of £567.5m and fair value of £567.5m. All
other loans and leases are classified as level 2 and have a carrying value and fair value of £4.3m.

It is the Company’s policy to recognise all the transfers into the levels and transfers out of the levels
at the date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer. No liabilities are
classified as level 3. :

The management assessed that the fair values of cash and short-term deposits, trade
receivables, trade payables, bank overdrafts and other current liabilities approximate their
carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.

(b) Credit risk

Financial risk management;

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial
instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations and arises principally from the Company's
receivables from customers and investment securities.

Other financial assets are short term deposits with terms of more than three months. The
counterparties have a credit rating of A1+/P1 or A1/P1, and hence there is minimal exposure
to credit risk for these values.

Cash and cash equivalents are short term deposits with counterparties that have a credit rating
of A1+/P1 or A1/P1, and hence there is minimal exposure to credit risk for these values.

25. Financial Instruments (continued)

(d) Liquidity risk

Financial risk management

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as
they fall due. The Company is a regulated utility with a five-year settlement with the industry
regulator, which allows it to plan to a certain degree of accuracy the financial obligations in the
medium term. The Company has also secured long-term funding through bonds issued by its
subsidiary company. This means that the need to obtain additional finance has been spread
over future years and is not considered onerous in any one regulatory period.

The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities, including estimated interest
payments and exciuding the effect of netting agreements:

25. Financial instruments (continued)

(e) Market risk
There is no exposure to equity or foreign currency risk, the interest rate risk is shown below.

Interest rate risk

At the year end the interest rate profile of the Company's interest-bearing financial instruments
was:

2024 2023

£m £m

Fixed rate instruments 1,589.7 1,488.1
Floating rate instruments 571.8 485.6
Index linked instruments 927.5 932.0

3,089.0 2,905.7

The Company policy is to keep a significant proportion of total financial instruments in each of
the three categories.

Sensitivity
The floating rate instruments are sensitive to interest rate movements. If there was a 1%

increase in interest rates on those floating rate instruments at the balance sheet date, there
would be an additional interest charge to the income statement of £5.7m.

Inflation sensitivity

Index linked bonds are sensitive to movements in the inflation rate. A 1% increase in the
inflation rate at the balance sheet date would result in an additional interest charge to the
income statement of £9.3m.

Wessex Water Services Ltd 188

26. Capital management

For the purpose of the Company’s capital management, capital includes issued capital, share
premium and all other equity reserves attributable to the equity holders. The primary objective of the
Company's capital management is to maximise the shareholder value.

The Company manages its capital structure and makes adjustments in light of changes in economic
conditions and the requirements of the financial covenants. To maintain or adjust the capital
structure, the Company may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to
shareholders or issue new shares. The Company monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is net
debt divided by Regulatory Capital Value (RCV). The Company’s policy is to keep the gearing ratio
below 70%. The Company includes within net debt interest bearing loans and borrowings, less cash
and short-term deposits, excluding discontinued operations.

The RCV at March for each regulated water and sewerage company is published by Ofwat here:
https.//www.ofwat.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/RC V-PR19_2024_Overall-.xisx

In order to achieve this overall objective, the Company's capital management, among other things,
aims to ensure that it meets financial covenants attached to the interest-bearing loans and
borrowings that define capital structure requirements. Breaches in meeting the financial covenants
would permit the bank to immediately call loans and borrowings. There have been no breaches of
the financial covenants of any interest-bearing loans and borrowing in the current period.

No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes for managing capital during the
years ended 30 June 2024 and 2023.

27. Commitments
Capital expenditure contracted but not provided at 30 June 2024 was £218.6m (2023: £150.1m).

The Company has guaranteed Bonds of £2,513.9m (2023: £2,320.1m) issued by its wholly owned
subsidiary company Wessex Water Services Finance Plc.

The Company has provided performance guarantees on its own behalf of £0.5m (2023: £0.5m).

Wessex Water Services Ltd 189

28. Contingent liabilities
Claims relating to the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 (EIR)

Alongside the rest of the sector, five claims have been issued against the Company. The
claims allege that in breach of the UK Environmental Information Regulation obligations, the
Company failed to provide environmental information free of charge. Consequently, the
personal search companies were required to purchase CON29DW searches in order to access
information. The claimants are seeking restitution of the sums paid, however, these sums are
not considered reliable. The Company is defending the claims. The first phase trial took place
in November and December 2023 and judgment was handed down on 28 June 2024. The
judgment is largely in the defendants’ favour and the trial judge has refused leave to appeal
(though the Claimants can re-apply to the Court of Appeal), In the absence of an appeal there
is still the possibility of a second phase trial (considering levels of compensation), however it
remains to be seen which issues fall to be determined at that trial or whether, in light of this
judgment, it is required at all.

Innovation competition

As part of the regulatory settlement for 2020-2025 Ofwat established a £200 million Innovation
competition to grow the water sector's capacity to innovate. The competition is to be funded
from additional revenues collected from customer's bills.

Each year companies are invited to submit projects which if successful are awarded funding
from the revenues already collected. If the company is unsuccessful the revenues are to.be
transferred to those companies that were successful. If at the end of the regulatory period the
revenues have not been fully utilised the balance is returned to customers over the subsequent
regulatory period.

Due to the uncertainty surrounding the nature, timing and value of any spend and the early
stage of the competition, the Company does not believe a provision is appropriate.

Incident at Avonmouth Water Recycling Centre

Investigations into the incident at Avonmouth in December 2020 are ongoing. We continue to
co-operate with the investigating authorities. It is not possible to assess any financial penalties
or related costs that could be incurred as a result of such investigations.

Flow to full treatment investigation

In November 2021, Ofwat and the Environment Agency announced separate industry-wide
investigations into Flow to Full Treatment at waste water recycling centres. Ofwat has since
opened enforcement cases into all sewerage undertakers in England and Wales, including the
Company. Ofwat has yet to formally respond on the investigation of the Company and the
timing of a response is unknown, though In early August 2024 Ofwat published proposed
enforcement action in respect of three other companies, including proposed fines. The EA
continue to issue written requests for information and have conducted a number of visits of
Water Recycling Centres. The Company continues to cooperate with both organisations as
they conduct their investigations.

31. Subsequent events

The final dividend for the year was declared in June 2024 and paid in July 2024.

32. Accounting estimates and judgements

In preparing the financial statements and applying the accounting policies, the Company is required
to make reasonable estimates and judgements based on the available information, the most
significant of which are: . :

a) Defined benefit pension scheme deficit

In recognising the deficit on the balance sheet there are a number of assumptions concerning
inflation, rate of increase of salaries and pensions, mortality rates and interest rates that can have
a significant effect on the deficit recorded. These assumptions are discussed with independent
qualified actuaries and disclosed in note 20 to the financial statements. The sensitivities around
these assumptions are also reflected in the note.

b) Expected credit loss provision

The expected credit loss on outstanding receivables is a key estimate under IFRS 9. We base our
estimate of recoverability by grouping customers into similar economic profiles and applying a
percentage loss rate based on forward looking judgements on the future collection rates that are
likely to be achieved. In particular for the year ended 30 June 2024 this has included additional
considerations of the possible impact of the ongoing ‘cost of living crisis’ on the expected collection
rates of outstanding receivables at the balance sheet date. These assumptions are discussed in
note 25. A 1% reduction in collection rates would increase the expected credit loss allowance by
£5.7m. .

c) Revenue recognition

The unbilled income accrual from metered water services requires an estimation of the amount of
commissioning unbilled charges at the period end. This is calculated using system generated
information based on average customer volume usage. A 2% movement in average consumption
equates to a £1.1m movement in the unbilled income accrual.

Wessex Water Services Ltd 192

32. Accounting estimates and judgements (continued)

d) Asset lives

Assets recorded in the Company’s fixed asset register are depreciated systematically using asset
lives assigned to the classification of the asset into a number of standard asset types. These asset
lives are subject to review based on historical performance, new technologies or new areas of
capital investment. A reduction in the asset life for property, plant and equipment of 1 year would
impact the depreciation charge by £10m.

Significant judgements

e) Classification of capital expenditure

Due to the high value of capital expenditure the judgements made on the classification of expenses
as operating or capital, and within capital between maintenance and enhancement, are key to the
preparation of the accounts. The Company follows both accounting standards and guidelines
issued by Ofwat in making these judgements.

Independent Auditor’s Report to the members of Wessex Water
Services Limited

Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of Wessex Water Services Limited for the year ended 30
June 2024 which comprise the Income Statement, the Statement of Other Comprehensive Income,
the Statement of Financial Position, the Statement of Changes in Equity, the Statement of Cash
Flows, and the related notes 1 to 32, including material accounting policy information. The financial
reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and UK adopted
international accounting standards.

In our opinion, the financial statements:

* — give a true and fair view of the company’s affairs as at 30 June 2024 and of its loss for the year
then ended;

« have been properly prepared in accordance with UK adopted international accounting
standards; and

e have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK))
and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's
responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of
the company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial
statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to other entities of public
interest, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these
requirements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
for our opinion. :

Conclusions relating to going concern

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern
basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. Our evaluation of
the directors’ assessment of the company’s ability to. continue to adopt the going concern basis of
accounting included completing the following procedures:

¢ Gained an understanding of the process undertaken by management to perform the going
concern assessment, including discussion with management to ensure key factors were
taken into account.

« Obtained management's forecast cash flows and covenant calculations covering the period
from 01 July 2024 to 31 December 2025 and agreed these to the Board approved budgets
and forecasts.

¢ Inquired of management as to their knowledge of events or conditions beyond the period of
their assessment that may cast significant doubt on the entity's ability to continue as a going
concern. ;

e Tested the mathematical accuracy of the cash flow forecasts, as well as the calculation of
the forecast covenants.

¢ Compared forecast future cashflows to historical data, ensuring variations are in line with our
expectations, such as historical performance, and understanding of the business and
considered the reliability of past forecasts.

Wessex Water Services Ltd 194

Challenged the Company’s ability to obtain additional liquidity, with the support of our debt
advisory specialists and agreed available facilities to underlying agreements and the extent
of drawings thereunder to external confirmations.

Evaluated the timing of the additional funding during the going concern period against
management's treasury plan.

Performed forecast covenant testing and considered any indicator of breach in the
assessment period.

Considered the most challenging but plausible downside scenario modelled by management
in respect of the assumptions used in the going concern assessment and included sensitivity
analysis on management's forecast cashflows to understand how more severe the conditions
would have to be to breach liquidity and/or covenants.

We considered regulatory impacts such as the ongoing Ofwat price and tariff review, i-e.,
PR24, following Ofwat’s Draft Determination announcement on 11 July 2024 and the re-
submission made by the company in August 2024. This covers the period from April 2025 to
March 2030 on the going concern assessment period.

Verified that management's going concern assessment took into account the Company's
updated PR24 submission, as well as a downside scenario reflecting the possibility of Ofwat's:
final determination being less favourable than the revised plan.

Understood and challenged the Board's controllable mitigation plans and the forecast impact
on the ability of the business to operate.within its financial covenants. We obtained supporting
documentation to evaluate the plausibility and achievability of management's mitigation plans
considering actions delivered to date.

Considered the results of other audit procedures and other knowledge obtained in the audit
and whether it was consistent with or contradicted management's assumptions.

Assessed the appropriateness of disclosures within the Annual Report and Accounts.

Our key observations:

In November 2023, the Company secured a £200 million bond.

In June 2024, the Company secured a facility for £300m maturing in 12 months with an option
at its discretion, to extend for a further 6 months thereafter.

The Company increased its revolving bank facility in June 2024, from £225 million to
£300million. The undrawn amount of the revolving credit facility as at 31 August 2024 is
£105m.

Management's going concern model incorporates the Company's updated PR24 submission,
as well as a downside scenario reflecting the possibility of Ofwat's final determination being
less favourable than the revised plan. .

The Company has £66m of debt maturity payments to make from the date of approval of the
financial statements to the end of the going concern assessment period.

The Company will need to raise further funding before the end of the going concern
assessment period to be able to repay the new £300m facility and finance the capital
programme over the period. ;

Considering the assessment made by the Directors, as disclosed in the basis of preparation,
the Directors are satisfied that the likelihood of not securing the forecasted debt within the
going concern period is remote.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to
events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the company’s
ability to continue as a going concern for a period to 31 December 2025.

Wessex Water Services Ltd 195

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are
described in the relevant sections of this report. However, because not all future events or conditions
can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the company’s ability to continue as a going
concern.

Other information

The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the
financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other
information contained within the annual report.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the
extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion
thereon.

Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other
information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the
course of the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material
inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives
rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have
performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other information, we are
required to report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

¢ the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for
which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and

e — the strategic report and directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal
requirements.

Matters on which we are required to report by exception

In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the
course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or directors’
report.

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act

2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:

* adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not
been received from branches not visited by us; or

e the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or

e certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or

e we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

Wessex Water Services Ltd 196

Responsibilities of directors

As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 141, the directors
are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give
a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable
the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to
fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the company’s
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern
and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the
company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a
whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's
report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material
if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic
decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities,
including fraud

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design
procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect irregularities, including fraud.
The risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting
one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or
intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. The extent to which our procedures are
capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below. However, the primary
responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with governance
of the entity and management. ,

+ We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the
company and determined that the most significant are:
o UK adopted international accounting standards
Tax Legislation (Governed by HM Revenue and Customs)
General Data Protection Regulation
" The UK Bribery Act
Anti-Money Laundering Legislation
Health & Safety Legislation
Ofwat Regulations
The Water Act (2003; 2014)
Environment Act (1995; 2021)

« We understood how Wessex Water Services Limited is complying with those frameworks by
enquiring with management to understand how the company maintain and communicate its
policies and procedures in relation to these areas. We evaluated the entity level control
environment through discussion with management and in-house legal counsel and inspecting
and observing the control environment.

00000000

Wessex Water Services Ltd 197

* We assessed the susceptibility of the Company’s financial statements to material misstatement,
including how fraud might occur by meeting with management and interna! audit to understand
where they considered there was susceptibility to fraud. We also considered performance
targets and the potential incentives or opportunities to manage earnings. We considered the
programmes and controls that the Company has established to address the risks identified, or
that otherwise prevent, deter and detect fraud; and how senior management monitors those
programs and controls. Where the risk was considered to be higher, we performed audit
procedures to address each identified fraud risk. These procedures included testing manual
journals and were designed to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements were
free from material fraud.

* Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify noncompliance with
such laws and regulations. Our procedures involved making enquiries of key management and
in-house legal counsel, reviewing key policies, inspecting legal registers and correspondence of
non-compliance from the relevant authorities and reports from any external legal teams, and
reading board meeting minutes. We performed journal entry testing to ensure that there are no
unusual legal or penalty expenses incurred during the year that haven't been disclosed and to
ensure that the management is in compliance with the applicable framework. For any non-
compliance noted, we assessed the accounting implications and read the financial statements
to evaluate the appropriateness of the disclosures.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the

Financial Reporting Council's website at https:/Awww-.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This
description forms part of our auditor's report.

Use of our report

This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of
Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to
the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and
for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume
responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our
audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
