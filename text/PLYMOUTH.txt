RYAN RAMSEY

TRUST CHAIRMAN

In the 5 years I've been on the
Board of the trust, the way in
which it has evolved has always
amazed me. The effect we have
in our communities both in
Devon and Cornwall is for many
people life changingly positive.
We've expanded considerably in
service provision and Foulston
hub is the next step in providing
even more. It’s genuinely
exciting phase of our strategy.

measuring our impact., alll of
which is detailed within our end of
year report. An example of some
of this work includes our health
provision which has seen us
increase our weight management
programmes across Cornwall
working with multiple partners to
tackle an identified health issue
and provide long-term changes
for people's lives.

Our Manadon Sports Hub has
been in operation for six years
and is truly embedded in the
local community; offering local
community activities, multi
sports through the whole year
and helping to provide a central
hub for community and sports
activities. The site is used by
schools, colleges, community
groups, local football and cricket
clubs through the private sector
and our own Trust delivery
programmes and the site has

Success comes down to all the
people involved, those at the
front line providing the services,
the support staff, managers and
the Executive team — the focus
underpinned by lived values has
been incredible and success is
always measured by those who
receive our services.

I'd also like to thank my fellow
Trustees, who give up their time

become a beacon within the local
community.

We are excited for the future and,
whilst we acknowledge there
will be challenges, we have an
exciting new Community Hub
opening which will support the
communities of West Plymouth
whilst also providing high quality
pitches for multiple sports. The
Hub at Foulston Park will enable
the charity to target those most
in need, increase physical activity
and well-being whilst improving
young people's lives.

The support we receive from

our partners, funders and parent
club enables us to deliver our
work. On behalf of everyone
associated with Plymouth Argyle
Football in the Community Trust
we would like to say thank you for
supporting the charity.

for free to support this amazing
organisation. It all makes me
proud to be a part of this venture.

ACHIEVEMENTS
AND PERFORMANCE

The Trustees have had due regard to the guidance published by the
Charity Commission in fulfilling public benefit.

Strategic update

Our work focuses on removing
barriers to participation in _
sport with an emphasis on
supporting underserved

and isolated communities,
underrepresented groups, and
at-risk children, young people,
and adults.

In short: ‘Our Club is
committed to our community.’

This year saw the close of our
2021-24 strategy which set
out our mission to make a
positive difference to Devon
and Cornwall communities
during this period. in this
report we reflect on our
achievements across the five
key strategic aims that we set
out in this strategy and are
detailed below:

Empower people to overcome
inequalities and raise aspirations
by providing opportunities and
accredited attainment.

Promote physical
participation and welibeing
by encouraging healthier

-lifestyles and removing: -

barriers to participation.

Inspire supporters to engage
with community outreach
programmes.

Improve our systems and
structures to provide quality,
efficient services that are
value for money by supplying
staff and communities with
comprehensive and ongoing
innovative leadership and
support.

Understanding and measuring
impact of our programmes on
the community.

We use the prestige of football
and the reach of Plymouth
Argyle Football Club to inspire,
engage, and help people of

all ages, genders, races, and

7

socioeconomic backgrounds.
Our vision is to ‘provide
opportunities to ail people
within local communities by
inspiring and empowering
them through sport’.

In recognition of our
dedication to those most

in need, we were crowned
champions at the national
Football Business Awards,
winning Best Football
Community Scheme,
non-Premier League. Our
commitment to improving
the life chances of local
people was celebrated as

we were named Community
Champions at the Devon &
Plymouth Chamber awards.
Nominations were also
received for two Sports
Business Awards for our work
promoting equality, diversity,
and inclusion, and Project 35,
our groundbreaking social
impact project in partnership
with Ginsters, aimed at
tackling poverty.

to combat the mental ill-
health, trauma, low academic
attainment, anti-social
behaviour, and involvement
in the criminal justice system
that research has shown
often result from parental
imprisonment.

Through this programme:

Higher Education

This year we celebrated a decade of collaboration with
Plymouth Marjon University, combining academic expertise
with practical experience. Our staff worked with the university
recruitment team as we looked to empower local people to
increase their academic attainment through higher education.
We also delivered lectures and facilitated work placements, and
casual employment contracts. Through this work, we supported
43 students and provided 1,290 hours of enriching placements

across our sport and community provisions.

Skills

Across our pre-employability
and traineeship programmes
(including YEP! and
COMPASS, with funding
from Careers South West),
our team has supported 81
local people to develop the
necessary skills to enter or
return to employment. Our
training and hands-on work
experience opportunities
totalled 1,231 hours of
personal development.

We also launched Devonport
Futures, an employability
and wellbeing programme
funded by Babcock
International and Kaefer.
Together we supported 20
unemployed local people to
develop confidence, self-

esteem, and industry skills
aligned to job opportunities
within Devonport Dockyard.
Participants were inspired

by tours of the dockyard,
introductory careers talks, and
health and safety training.

FACILITIES

This year, 219,000 visits
were made across our three
facilities to community
provisions provided by
ourselves and our valued
local partners.

The Football Foundation’s
Power Pitch Fund supported
us to maintain our playing
pitches at Manadon Sports
and Community Hub. Their
commitment to improving
and maintaining high quality
grassroots pitches allowed
us to provide all-weather
facility access to grassroots
adult and youth teams as we
support local people to get
active. This year over 500
young players participated in
organised affiliated football
from our venue.

With funding from the
Plymouth City Council's
Household Support Fund and
Clarion Housing, Manadon
Sports Hub opened as a
warm space for 141 tocal
people who were struggling
with the cost-of-living

crisis. We provided free hot
food and drinks, access to
charging points and Wi-Fi,
and information from local
services and organisations. We
also supplied 40 warm packs
with electric blankets, slow
cookers, and heating timers,
to support residents facing
fuel poverty to stay warm at
home. The National Lottery
Food Club also allowed local
people to take nutritious food

home with them as we strive
to combat food poverty.

Through Plymouth City
Council, we were fortunate

to secure a Workplace Travel
Scheme that allowed us to
install EV Charge points and
electric bikes at our Manadon
Sports Hub site. In line with our
Environmental Sustainability
Plan, this supports our net zero
ambitions whilst promoting
direct transport links across
the city.

With funding from Clarion
Housing and National Grid,
we have begun work to
develop a Community
Allotment that will be
completed in 2024/25.
Through this green space,
we will provide opportunities
for those experiencing social
isolation to come together
through a shared passion for
growing food. We will also
create an environment where
people are empowered to
become community/work
ready and will provide access
to nutritious food for people
who are facing food insecurity.

We also launched Pilgrim
Pizza — our mobile catering
van, in partnership with The
Rank Foundation and Four
Greens Community Trust.

The van uses food to connect
local communities and drive
conversation and interaction.
In partnership with Plymouth
Argyle, Plymouth City Council,

Plymouth Albion RFC, and
Devonport Community
Leisure Limited, this year
saw us Commence our
exciting redevelopment of
Brickfields Sports Centre into
a community hub

In 2023/24, we have secured
over £2.5m in grant funding,
which together with our
facilities reserves fund, is
enabling us to create a facility
that meets the needs of
local people living in an area
of deprivation and health
inequality. Capital funding,
including grants from the
Community Ownership Fund,
Bernard Sunley, The Garfield
Weston Foundation, and The
Clothworkers’ Foundation,
is allowing us to create
accessible facilities with
sports, leisure, wellbeing
and personal development
opportunities for people of
all ages, backgrounds, and
abilities. In addition, our
successful application to the
Youth Investment Fund will
enable us to work with over
2,000 local young people
through our open-access
youth hub and positive
provisions that support
their personal development,
encourage them to participate
in training and qualifications,
and reduce crime and anti-
social behaviour.

COLLEAGUES AND
ENGAGEMENT

Our dedicated and
hardworking staff are at the
heart of what we do, providing
the services and outcomes our
communities need.

We welcomed a tranche of
new staff following a TUPE
transfer in September 2023
with a full integration into the
organisation.

A re-evaluation of our staff
structure took place during
the year to consider:

¢ Diversification and
re-alignment of streams
of work

¢ Growth of the business
- including increased
participants, projects and
programmes

¢ Limitations for staff

retention, recruitment and

* Cost effectiveness and
efficiency and staff

Resulting in changes to
structure, level and pay
whilst providing clear lines of
progression for all.

We provided pathways and
training for our apprentices
to enable them to move into
contracted employment
with us. Investment for staff

~FUTURE DIRECTION

We are extremely proud of the
work that we have undertaken
not only in 2023/24 but
throughout the past five years
of our strategy. During this
period, we have adapted our
work to meet the needs of our
community. This has included
our response to the COVID-19
pandemic and our support

of local people facing food
insecurity and the cost-of
living crisis.

At present we are shaping
our new strategy, using
consultation with staff, key
stakeholders, and participants
to shape our future direction.
Informed by local need, a large
focus of our work will include
maintaining and developing
our facilities based in areas

of need, including the new
Brickfields Community Hub.
Central to this process will

be using the voices of the

34

people we serve to co-design
provisions that empower and
support them to live healthy
lives and achieve their full
potential.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S
REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF
PLYMOUTH ARGYLE FOOTBALL
IN THE COMMUNITY TRUST

Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of Plymouth
Argyle Football in the Community Trust (the ‘charity’}

for the year ended 30 June 2024, which comprise the
Statement of Financial Activities, Balance Sheet, Statement
of Cash Flows, and Notes to the Financial Statements,
including a summary of significant accounting policies.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in
their preparation is United Kingdom Accounting Standards,
comprising Charities SORP - FRS 102 ‘The Financial
Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of
Ireland’ and applicable law (United Kingdom Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice).

In our opinion the financial statements:

¢ give a true and fair view of the state of the charity's
affairs as at 30 June 2024 and of its incoming
resources and application of resources, including its
income and expenditure, for the year then ended;

+ have been properly prepared in accordance with
United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting .
Practice; and
have been prepared in accordance with the
requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law.
Our responsibilities under those standards are further
described in the auditor responsibilities for the audit of
the financial statements section of our report. We are
independent of the charity in accordance with the ethical
requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial
statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard,
and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in
accordance with these requirements. We believe that

the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Conclusions relating to going concern

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded
that the trustees use of the going concern basis of
accounting in the preparation of the financial statements
is appropriate.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not
identified any material uncertainties relating to events
or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast
significant doubt on the charity's ability to continue as
a going concern for a period of at least twelve months
from when the original financial statements were
authorised for issue.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the trustees
with respect to going concern are described in the
relevant sections of this report.

Other information

The trustees are responsible for the other information.
The other information comprises the information included
in the annual report, other than the financial statements
and our auditor's report thereon. Our opinion on the
financial statements does not cover the other information
and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in

our report, we do not express any form of assurance
conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements,
our responsibility is to read the other information and,

in doing so, consider whether the other information

is materially inconsistent with the financial statements

or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise
appears to be materially misstated. If we identify

such material inconsistencies or apparent material
misstatements, we are required to determine whether - ©  - - ~
there is a material misstatement in the financial
statements or a material misstatement of the other
information. If, based on the work we have performed,
we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this
other information, we are required to report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.

Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies
Act 2006

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the
course of the audit:

the information given in the Trustees’ Report for the
financial year for which the financial statements are
prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
the Trustees’ Report has been prepared in accordance
with applicable legal requirements.

37

PLYMOUTH ARGYLE FOOTBALL IN THE COMMUNITY TRUST TRADING AS ARGYLE COMMUNITY TRUST

Matters on which we are required to report by exception

In the light of our knowledge and understanding of the
charity and its environment obtained in the course of the
audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the
Trustees’ Report. ’
We have nothing to report in respect of the following
matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to
report to you if, in our opinion:

* adequate accounting records have not been kept, or
returns adequate for our audit have not been received
from branches not visited by us; or

+ the financial statements are not in agreement with the
accounting records and returns; or

* certain disctosures of trustees remuneration specified
by law are not made; or

* we have not received all the information and
explanations we require for our audit.

Responsibilities of trustees

As explained more fully in the Statement of trustees’
responsibilities, the trustees are responsible for the
preparation of the financial statements and for being
satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such
internal control as the trustees determine is necessary to
enable the preparation of financial statements that are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the trustees are
responsible for assessing the charity's ability to continue as
a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related
to going concern and using the going concern basis of
accounting unless the trustees either intend to liquidate
the charity or to cease operations, or have no realistic
alternative but to do so.

Auditor responsibilities for the audit of the
financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error,

and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is
not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance
with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or
error and are considered material if, individually or in the
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of
these financial statements.

The extent to which our procedures are capable of
detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below:

We identified areas of laws and regulations that could
reasonably be expected to have a material effect on

the financial statements from our general commercial
and sector experience and through discussion with the
directors and other management. We communicated
identified laws and regulations throughout our team, and
remained alert to any indications of non-compliance
throughout the audit.

The charity and group are subject to laws and regulations
that govern the preparation of the financial statements,
including financial reporting legislation, and other charity
legislation. The charity and group are also subject to other
laws and regulations where the consequences of non-
compliance could have a material impact on the amounts
or disclosures within the financial statements, including
employment, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering and
certain aspects of charities legislation.

Owing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an
unavoidable risk that we may not have detected some
material misstatements in the financial statements,

even though we have property planned and performed
our audit in accordance with auditing standards. In any
audit, there remains a higher risk of non-detection of
irregularities, as these may involve collusion, forgery,
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override
of internal controls. We are not responsible for preventing
non-compliance and cannot be expected to detect
noncompliance with all laws and regulations.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs (UK), we
exercise professional judgement and maintain professional
scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement
of the financial statements, whether due to fraud

or error, design and perform audit procedures
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence
that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a

basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a
material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher
than for one resulting from error, as fraud may
invotve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

¢ Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant
to the audit in order to design audit procedures that
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness
of the charity's internal control.

+ Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates
and related disclosures made by the trustees.

+ Conclude on the appropriateness of the trustees use
of the going concern basis of accounting and, based
on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material
uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that
may cast significant doubt on the charity's ability to
continue as a going concern. If we conclude that
a material uncertainty exists, we are required to
draw attention in our auditor's report to the related
disclosures in the financial statements or, if such
disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion.
Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence

38

PLYMOUTH ARGYLE FOOTBALL IN THE COMMUNITY TRUST TRADING AS ARGYLE COMMUNITY TRUST

obtained up to the date of our auditor's report.
However, future events or conditions may cause the
charity to cease to continue as a going concern.

¢ Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and
content of the financial statements, including the
disclosures, and whether the financial statements
represent the underlying transactions and events ina
manner that achieves fair presentation.

We communicate with those charged with governance
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including
any significant deficiencies in internal control that we
identify during our audit.

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-
compliance with laws and regulations. We design
procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined
above, to detect material misstatements in respect

of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which
our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities,
including fraud is detailed below: {to move up in audit
report to correct position)

Use of our report

This report is made solely to the charitable company’s
trustees, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of

Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has
been undertaken so that we might state to the charity's
trustees those matters we are required to state to them

in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or
assume responsibility to anyone other than the charitable
company and its trustees as a body, for our audit work, for
this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

2. Accounting policies

Summary of significant accounting policies and key
accounting estimates

The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation
of these financial statements are set out below. These
poticies have been consistently applied to all the years
presented, unless otherwise stated.

Statement of compliance

The financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with Accounting and Reporting by Charities: Statement of
Recommended Practice (applicable to charities preparing
their accounts in accordance with the Financial Reporting
Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland (FRS
102)) {issued in October. 2019) -.(Charities SORP (FRS 102)),
the Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and
Republic of ireland (FRS 102) and the Companies Act 2006.

Basis of preparation

The financial statements have been prepared on the
historical cost basis, as modified by the revaluation of certain
financial assets and liabilities and investment properties
measured at fair value through income or expenditure.

The financial statements are prepared in sterling, which is
the functional currency of the entity.

Going concern

The trustees consider that there are no material
uncertainties about the charity's ability to continue as a
going concern nor any significant areas of uncertainty that
affect the carrying value of assets held by the charity.

Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of the financial statements requires
management to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported. These
estimates and judgements are continually reviewed and
are based on experience and other factors, including
expectations of future events that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances.

Fund structure

Unrestricted funds are available for use at the discretion of
the trustees to further any of the charity's purposes.

Designated funds are unrestricted funds earmarked by the
trustees for particular future project or commitment.

Restricted funds are subjected to restrictions on their
expenditure declared by the donor or through the terms of
an appeal, and fall into one of two sub-ctasses: restricted
income funds or endowment funds.

Income and endowments

All incoming resources are included in the statement

of financial activities when entitlement has passed to
the charity; it is probable that the economic benefits
associated with the transaction will flow to the charity
and the amount can be reliably measured. The following
specific policies are applied to particular categories of
income:

Donations, Legacies and Grants

Income from donations or grants is recognised when
there is evidence of entitlement to the gift, receipt is
probable and its amount can be measured reliably. Legacy
income is recognised when receipt is probable and
entitlement is established. .

Donated services and facilities

Income from donated goods is measured at the fair value
of the goods unless this is impractical to measure reliably,
in which case the vatue is derived from the cost to the
donor or the estimated resale value. Donated facilities and
services are recognised in the accounts when received

if the value can be reliably measured. No amounts are
included for the contribution of generat volunteers.

Contracts

Income from contracts for the supply of services is
recognised with the delivery of the contracted service.
This is classified as unrestricted funds unless there is a
contractual requirement for it to be spent on a particular
purpose and returned if unspent, in which case it may be
regarded as restricted.

Deferred income

Deferred income represents amounts received for future
periods and is released to incoming resources in the
period for which, it has been received. Such income is
only deferred when:

+ — The donor specifies that the grant or donation must only
be used in future accounting periods; or

« — The donor has imposed conditions which must be met
before the charity has unconditional entitlement.

Expenditure

Expenditure is recognised on an accruals basis as a liability is
incurred. Expenditure includes any VAT which cannot be fully
recovered, and is classified under headings of the statement
of financial activities to which it relates:

Raising funds

Expenditure on raising funds includes the costs of allt
fundraising activities, events, non-charitable trading activities,
and the sale of donated goods.

Charitable activities

Expenditure on charitable activities includes all costs incurred
by a charity in undertaking activities that further its charitable
aims for the benefit of its beneficiaries, including those
support costs and costs relating to the governance of the
charity apportioned to charitable activities.

Other expenditure

Other expenditure includes all expenditure that is neither
related to raising funds for the charity nor part of its
expenditure on charitable activities.

Direct costs

All costs are allocated to expenditure categories reflecting
the use of the resource. Direct costs attributable to a single
activity are allocated directly to that activity. Shared costs
are apportioned between the activities they contribute to
on a reasonable, justifiable and consistent basis.

Support costs

Support costs include central functions and have been
allocated to activity cost categories on a basis consistent with
the use of resources, for example, allocating property costs
by floor areas, or per capita, staff costs by the time spent and
other costs by their usage.

Governance costs

These include the costs attributable to the charity's
compliance with constitutional and statutory requirements,
including audit, strategic management and trustees meetings
and reimbursed expenses.

Operating leases

Lease payments are recognised as an expense over the lease
term ona straight-line basis. The aggregate benefit of lease
incentives is recognised as a reduction to expense over the
lease term, on a straight-line basis.

Tangible fixed assets

Tangible assets are initially recorded at cost, and
subsequently stated at cost less any accumulated

depreciation and impairment losses. Any tangible assets
carried at revalued amounts are recorded at the fair
value at the date of revaluation less any subsequent
accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated
impairment losses.

An increase in the carrying amount of an asset as a result
of a revaiuation, is recognised in other recognised gains
and losses, unless it reverses a charge for impairment that
has previously been recognised as expenditure within the
statement of financial activities. A decrease in the carrying
amount of an asset as a result of revaluation, is recognised
in other recognised gains and losses, except to which it
offsets any previous revaluation gain, in which case the
loss is shown within other recognised gains and losses on
the statement of financial activities.

Depreciation and amortisation

Depreciation is provided on tangible fixed assets so as to
write off the cost or valuation, less any estimated residual
value, over their expected useful economic life as follows:

Depreciation method and rate
4% straight tine
30% reducing balance

Asset class

Long leasehold property
Fixtures and fittings
Motor vehicles 25% straight line
Computer equipment 40% reducing balance
Assets under construction not depreciated

Impairment of fixed assets

A review for indicators of impairment is carried out at
each reporting date, with the recoverable amount being
estimated where such indicators exist. Where the carrying
value exceeds the recoverable amount, the asset is
impaired accordingly. Prior impairments are also reviewed
for possible reversal at each reporting date.

For the purposes of impairment testing, when it is not
possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an
individual asset, an estimate is made of the recoverable
amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset
belongs. The cash-generating unit is the smallest
identifiable group of assets that includes the asset and
generates cash inflows that largely independent of the
cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.

For impairment testing of goodwill, the goodwill acquired
in a business combination is, from the acquisition

date, allocated to each of the cash-generating units

that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the
combination, irrespective of whether other assets or
liabilities of the charity are assigned to those units.

Taxation

The charity is considered to pass the tests set out in
Paragraph 1 Schedule 6 of the Finance Act 2010 and
therefore it meets the definition of a charitable company
for UK corporation tax purposes. Accordingly, the charity
is potentially exempt from taxation in respect of income
or capital gains received within categories covered by
Chapter 3 Part 11 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 or
Section 256 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act
1992, to the extent that such income or gains are applied
exclusively to charitable purposes.

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and call
deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that
are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are
subject to an insignificant risk of change in value.

Borrowings

Interest-bearing borrowings are initially recorded at fair value,
net of transaction costs. Interest-bearing borrowings are
subsequently carried at amortised cost, with the difference
between the proceeds, net of transaction costs, and the
amount due on redemption being recognised as a charge

to the Statement of Financial Activities over the period of the
relevant borrowing.

Interest expense is recognised on the basis of the effective
interest method and is included in interest payable and
similar charges.

Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the
charity has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the
liability for at least twelve months after the reporting date.

Financial instruments

Classification

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when
the charity becomes a party to the contractual provisions of
the instrument.

Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified
according to the substance of the contractual arrangements
entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that
evidences a residual interest in the assets of the charity after
deducting all of its liabilities.

Recognition and measurement

All financial assets and liabilities are initially measured at
transaction price (including transaction costs), except for
those financial assets classified as at fair value through profit
or loss, which are initially measured at fair value (which is
normally the transaction price excluding transaction costs),
unless the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction.
If an arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, the
financial asset or financial liabitity is measured at the present
value of the future payments discounted at a market rate of
interest for a similar debt instrument.

Financial assets and liabilities are only offset in the statement
of financial position when, and only when there exists a
legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts
and the charity intends either to settle on a net basis, or to
realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Financial assets are derecognised when and only when a)

the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial
asset expire or are settled, b) the charity transfers to another
party substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of
the financial asset, or c) the charity, despite having retained
some, but not all, significant risks and rewards of ownership,
has transferred control of the asset to another party.

Financial liabilities are derecognised only when the obligation
specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires.

Debt instruments

Debt instruments which meet the following conditions are
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective
interest method:

(a) The contractual return to the holder is (i) a fixed amount;
(ii) a positive fixed rate or a positive variable rate; or (iii) a
combination of a positive or a negative fixed rate anda
positive variable rate.

{b) The contract may provide for repayments of the principal
or the return to the holder (but not both) to be linked toa
single relevant observable index of general price inflation of
the currency in which the debt instrument is denominated,
provided such links are not leveraged.

(c) The contract may provide for a determinable variation

of the return to the holder during the life of the instrument,
provided that (i) the new rate satisfies condition (a) and the
variation is not contingent on future events other than (1)

a change of a contractual variable rate; (2} to protect the
holder against credit deterioration of the issuer: (3) changes
in levies applied by a central bank or arising from changes in
relevant taxation or law; or (ii) the new rate is a market rate of
interest and satisfies condition (a).

{d) There is no contractual provision that could, by its terms,
result in the holder losing the principal amount or any
interest attributable to the current period or prior periods.

{e) Contractual provisions that permit the issuer to prepay
a debt instrument or permit the holder to put it back to
the issuer before maturity are not contingent on future
events, other than to protect the holder against the credit
deterioration of the issuer or a change in control of the
issuer, or to protect the holder or issuer against changes in
levies applied by a central bank or arising from changes in
relevant taxation or law.

{f) Contractual provisions may permit the extension of the
term of the debt instrument, provided that the return to
the holder and any other contractual provisions applicable
during the extended term satisfy the conditions of
paragraphs (a) to (c).

Debt instruments that are classified as payable or receivable
within one year on initial recognition and which meet the
above conditions are measured at the undiscounted amount
of the cash or other consideration expected to be paid or
received, net of impairment.

With the exception of some hedging instruments, other debt
instruments not meeting these conditions are measured at
fair value through profit or loss.

Commitments to make and receive loans which meet the
conditions mentioned above are measured at cost (which
may be nil) less impairment.

investments

Investments in non-convertible preference shares and non-
puttable ordinary or preference shares (where shares are
publicly traded or their fair value is reliably measurable) are
measured at fair vatue through profit or loss. Where fair value
cannot be measured reliably, investments are measured at
cost less impairment.

Investments in subsidiaries and associates are measured

at cost less impairment. For investments in subsidiaries
acquired for consideration including the issue of shares
qualifying for merger relief, cost is measured by reference to
the nominal value of the shares issued plus fair value of other
consideration. Any premium is ignored.
