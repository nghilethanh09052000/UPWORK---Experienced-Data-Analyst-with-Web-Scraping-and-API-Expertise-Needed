work with our employers and communities to ensure our offer brings economic and social value to Rochdale and
beyond.

For the period of the plan, which covers the period to 31st July, 2024, our strategic objectives were:

To increase apprenticeships from 246 to 300.

To source other funding streams e.g. GMCA - Skills Bootcamp, Acorn.

To maintain commercial training and income directly from employers by offering a more holistic service, in order
to reduce dependency on government funding.

distinctions.

observations meeting the required standard.

TRUSTEES' REPORT (INCLUDING DIRECTORS' REPORT) (CONTINUED)

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2024

Our apprenticeship starts are 277 for 2023/24, below target by 23, and we will work to achieve 300 in 2024/25.
In 2023/24 we began to deliver study programmes for NEET young people achieving £82k, +£22k on budget.

Our tenders to source other funding streams have gone well i.e. Acorn achieved £39k, Skills Bootcamp £360k. In
2023/24 we won a direct contract from GMCA for devolved AEB Level 2 and 3, so has increased our financial
performance this year taking £527k (last years subcontracted AEB contract from Remploy achieved £213k).

The commercial courses have increased this year to £242k +£72k on budget and +£24k on last year.

In addition, we plan to build on our active involvement in partnerships e.g. The Rochdale Network, GMLPN and
our strong links with the local authority.

We will also strive to increase participation, success rates, progressions and the number of distinctions and
further increase the quality of our provision, in order to achieve outstanding OFSTED grades.

The beneficial area of charitable expenditure is the United Kingdom, with preference for the Rochdale area. The
trustees have reviewed the outcomes and achievements of the activities for the year to ensure that they remain
focused on the charitable aims and continue to deliver benefits to the public. We have complied with the duty
under the Charities Act to have due regard to the public benefit guidance published by the commission.

The trustees have paid due regard to guidance issued by the Charity Commission in deciding what activities the
charity should undertake. .

Achievements and performance
This has been a good year for RTA financially as the AEB and Skills Bootcamp contracts did well, achieving
growth.

In April 2022, we were inspected by Ofsted and achieved a Good for overall effectiveness, Quality of Education,
Behaviour & Attitudes, Personal Development, Leadership & Management, Education for Young People and
Apprenticeships and we continue to work towards achieving an outstanding grade at the next Ofsted Inspection.

There are many changes afoot in Ofsted, currently a new education inspection framework will be published in
September 2025.

Our success rate on apprenticeships was 71% 4% up on last year and compared with the national average of
54% and on the adult workplace learning programmes it was 90%, an increase on last year and + 3% on national
average.

The Apprenticeship Standards are going well, with a 99% EPA pass rate in 2023/24 and 33% of Apprentices
achieving a distinction (+2% on last year) and 13% a merit (+1% on last year).

We have developed a large tutor office in an unused area to enable us to increase classroom spaces and in
2024/25 will continue to update our building and IT equipment.

We will continue to endeavour to grow the range of commercial services offered to companies and increase our
membership, with our reviewed membership package.

The investments have performed according to our expectations.

The investment policy and objective is to minimise the risk of holding all monies in one financial institution and
they are reviewed annually. We ensure to the best of our knowledge that investments are placed in ethical
organisations e.g. the Co-Operative Bank.


ROCHDALE TRAINING ASSOCIATION LIMITED

TRUSTEES' REPORT (INCLUDING DIRECTORS' REPORT) (CONTINUED)

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2024

Financial review

The net incoming resources for the year amounted to £174,465 (2023 - £19,791) and details are shown in the
statement of financial activities on page 12. Direct charitable expenditure accounted for 63% (2023 — 64%) of
total expenditure.

Reserves policy

The Council of Management has established a policy whereby the unrestricted funds not committed or invested
in tangible fixed assets (‘the free reserves’) held by the charity should be approximately 3-6 months of the
resources expended, which equates to £732,999 - £1,465,998 in general funds. At present the free reserves,
which net of designated and restricted funds amount to £1,904,991, can continue to support this policy for the
immediate future. Some of the ‘free reserves’ will be used to improve the premises and equipment. Also rising
energy costs and other economic pressures mean it is important that we continue to hoid the ‘free reserves’ to
mitigate against the risk of this uncertain landscape.

Principle funding sources
The principle funding sources for the charitable company are:

- Levy-paying employers

- Non-levy paying employers via AS system
- Adult Education Budget

- Skills Boot camp

Other sundry sources of income include:

- Study Programmes

- Acorn Training

- Princes Trust

- Rental income for room hire

- Corporate training sessions

- Investment income.

Principle risk and uncertainties

The Council of Management has conducted its own review of the major risks to which the charity is exposed and
are attempting to develop systems to mitigate those risks. They are aware that significant external risks to
funding require a strategic plan which will allow for the diversification of funding and activities.

The main risk in 2024/25 is not increasing Apprenticeship starts. We intend to deliver more adult courses e.g.
AEB employed and unemployed programmes and Skills Bootcamp to make up for any shortfall in
Apprenticeships.


ROCHDALE TRAINING ASSOCIATION LIMITED

COMPANY LIMITED BY GUARANTEE
TRUSTEES' REPORT (INCLUDING DIRECTORS' REPORT) (CONTINUED)

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2024

Another risk is not achieving the required grades / standards set by Ofsted. We had an inspection in April 2022
and maintained out Grade 2 - good - provision for overall effectiveness and for all the other judgements. The
Education Inspection Framework is changing in September 2025. We have a Quality Team and Quality
Improvement Plan in place to ensure we continuously improve our provision in line with Ofsted's requirement.

Another risk is having funds clawed back due to an unsuccessful ESFA Audit. We were audited in July 2017 and
the error rate was 0.66%. Funds are clawed back if the error rate is over 5%; therefore, our outcome was very
good. We had a very small audit in July 2021 of Traineeships & AEB programmes and were deemed satisfactory.
There is a Quality Compliance Manager and an Audit Schedule in place to maintain these standards and mitigate
against any risk. We have also taken on another audit due to the increase in different programmes.

As we have won new contracts e.g. the AEB Level 2, another risk is not having a successful audit, as we have
not experienced a GMCA audit before. However, the contract manager and compliance manager, and newly
appointed auditor are well versed in the AEB funding rules has been added to our audit schedule to lessen the
risk.

Internal risks are minimised by the implementation of procedures for authorisation of alt transactions and projects
and to ensure consistent quality of delivery for all operational aspects of the charitable company. These
procedures are periodically reviewed to ensure that they still meet the needs of the charity.

Financial risk management objectives and policies
The charitable company finances its operations through retained funds. The management's objectives are to
retain sufficient liquid funds to enable the company to meet its day to day obligations as they fall due.

The charitable company makes little use of financial instruments other than an operational sterling bank account
and longer term sterling deposits and bonds, so its exposure to price risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow
tisk is not material for the assessment of the assets, liabilities, financial position and net incoming/outgoing
resources.

Plans for future periods
The charitable company plans to continue its training activities for the foreseeable future, subject to satisfactory

funding arrangements.
The plans described in Objectives and Activities above, continue to apply for the following 3 years.

We shall continue to develop our “one-stop shop” approach and continue broadening our market base. Although
apprenticeship starts have not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels, growth is still a clear long term aim and to
that end we shall maintain focus on both company needs and iocal and national government priorities.

Structure, governance and management
The charitable company was incorporated on 31st January, 1967 and is governed by its Memorandum and
Articles of Association, which established its objects and powers.

Trustees
The directors of the charitable company are its trustees for the purpose of charity Law and throughout the report
are collectively referred to as the trustees.

The trustees of the charitable company who served during the year and up to the date of signature of the
financial statements were:

Appointment of Trustees

Trustees, drawn from member companies of our wider networks (see below), are elected at the Annual General
Meeting (AGM) to form a management committee of between 5 and 11. A third of the trustees retire each year
and are eligible for re-election. All members are circulated with invitations to nominate trustees prior to the AGM,
advising them of the retiring trustees and requesting nominations for the AGM. The trustees have the power to
co-opt members to the committee when appropriate particularly with regard to the need for any specialist skills.
The management committee elects the Chairman.

None of the trustees has any beneficial interest in the charitable company. All of the trustees are members of the
charitable company and guarantee to contribute £1 in the event of a winding up.

Trustees meetings and staff meetings (both formal and informal) provide a satisfactory forum to ensure that all
trustees are familiar with the charitable company's policies and procedures. All trustees are provided with the
Charity Commission's "Responsibility of Trustees".

Market value of land and buildings
The trustees consider that the market value of land and buildings is in excess of their book value, but no
professional valuation has been undertaken to quantify this.

Organisation
The Council of Management, the trustees detailed above, meet quarterly and at any other times to consider
special issues or to enable future planning to be satisfactorily carried out.

The Chief Executive, Jill Nagy, is appointed by the trustees to manage the day to day operations of the charity. To
facilitate effective operations, the Chief Executive has delegated authority, within terms of delegation approved
by the trustees, for operational matters including finance, employment and performance related activity.

Pay Policy for Senior Staff
This is reviewed annually in November, after accounts are finalised and be paid from November.

There are four elements to the process.

1. Cost of Living

Increases in line with cost of living will be discussed and reviewed at the Board meeting in September and will be
confirmed in November, following the accounts being finalised. They will be granted if they are sustainable for the
business i.e. if the financial performance of the Association during the immediately preceding 24 month period
justifies the increase.


ROCHDALE TRAINING ASSOCIATION LIMITED

COMPANY LIMITED BY GUARANTEE
TRUSTEES’ REPORT (INCLUDING DIRECTORS’ REPORT) (CONTINUED)

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2024

2. Merit Payment based on Performance
This will be assessed on performance against objectives agreed at appraisal at the start of the year. Judgement
against each objective will be based on the descriptors of:

Unsatisfactory - not achieved, no progress
Satisfactory - met targets

Good - exceeded targets by 10%
Outstanding - exceeded targets by 20%

There is a fifth judgement of changed circumstances which would make the objective inappropriate. Senior staff
will carry out a self-assessment and the Chief Executive shall also assess their performance. This will create the
basis for discussion. The appraisal shall look at the balance of performance against the individual objectives,
weighted in favour of the key objective, to arrive at an initial overall judgement. This should be balanced against
initiative, team contribution, commitment, professionalism, developing Rochdale Training in order to arrive at final
grading.

Unsatisfactory or satisfactory performance - no increase
Good performance - up to 3% increase
Outstanding performance - up to 6% increase

3. Bonus Payment ,
One-off bonus payments for one-off specific successes in moving RTA forward. This is payable at the Chief
Executive's discretion up to £1,000.

4. Mid-year Adjustments
Structural job changes or increases based on defensive commercial decision shall be at the discretion of the
Chief Executive.

5. Company Wide Bonus

Following an extremely successful year the Board may decide to award an across the board team bonus. This is
at their discretion. If a member of staff is under Disciplinary or Performance Management procedure they are not
entitled to the Company wide bonus.

Wider Networks
Rochdale Training Association Limited (RTA) are members of Greater Manchester Chamber of Commerce, The
Association of Learning Providers and Greater Manchester Learning Provider Network.

The trustees, who are also the directors of Rochdale Training Association Limited for the purpose of company
law, are responsible for preparing the Trustees' Report and the financial statements in accordance with
applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice).

Company Law requires the trustees to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and
fair view of the state of affairs of the charity and of the incoming resources and application of resources, including
the income and expenditure, of the charitable company for that year.

In preparing these financial statements, the trustees are required to:

- select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;

- observe the methods and principles in the Charities SORP;

- make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and

- prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the
charity will continue in operation.

The trustees are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at
any time the financial position of the charitable company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements
comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the charitable
company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

Auditor
In accordance with the charitable company's articles, a resolution proposing that Ashworth Moulds be
reappointed as auditor of the charitable company will be put at a General Meeting.

Small company provisions
This report was been prepared in accordance with the special provisions for small companies under Part 15 of
the Companies Act 2006.

Disclosure of information to auditor

Each of the trustees has confirmed that there is no information of which they are aware which is relevant to the
audit, but of which the auditor is unaware. They have further confirmed that they have taken appropriate steps to
identify such relevant information and to establish that the auditor is aware of such information.

The trustees’ report was approved by the Board of Trustees.

ROCHDALE TRAINING ASSOCIATION LIMITED

COMPANY LIMITED BY GUARANTEE
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT

TO THE MEMBERS OF ROCHDALE TRAINING ASSOCIATION LIMITED

Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of Rochdale Training Association Limited (the “charitable company") for
the year ended 31 July 2024 which comprise the statement of financial activities including income and expenditure
account, the balance sheet, the statement of cash flows and the notes to the financial statements, including a
summary of significant accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their
preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including Financial Reporting Standard
102 The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland (United Kingdom Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice).

In our opinion, the financial statements:

- give a true and fair view of the state of the charitable company’s affairs as at 31 July 2024 and of its incoming
resources and application of resources, for the year then ended;

- have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice;
and

- have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable
law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of
the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the charitable company in accordance with the
ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical
Standard, and the provisions available for small entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in
accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Conclusions relating to going concern
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the trustees’ use of the going concem basis of
accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or
conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the charity's ability to continue as a going
concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the trustees with respect to going concern are described in the
relevant sections of this report.

Other information

The other information comprises the information included in the annual report other than the financial statements
and our auditor's report thereon. The trustees are responsible for the other information contained within the annual
report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent
otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. Our
responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially
inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears
to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are
required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If,
based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information,
we are required to report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.


ROCHDALE TRAINING ASSOCIATION LIMITED

COMPANY LIMITED BY GUARANTEE
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT (CONTINUED)

TO THE MEMBERS OF ROCHDALE TRAINING ASSOCIATION LIMITED

Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of our audit:

- the information given in the trustees’ report, which includes the directors’ report prepared for the purposes of
company law, for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the
financial statements; and

- the directors’ report, included within the trustees’ report, has been prepared in accordance with applicable
legal requirements.

Matters on which we are required to report by exception

In the fight of the knowledge and understanding of the charitable company and its environment obtained in the
course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the directors’ report included within the
trustees’ report.

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires

us to report to you if, in our opinion: .

- adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received
from branches not visited by us; or

- the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or

- certain disclosures of trustees’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or

- we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or

- the trustees were not entitled to prepare the financial statements in accordance with the small companies
regime and take advantage of the small companies’ exemptions in preparing the trustees' report and from the
requirement to prepare a strategic report.

Responsibilities of trustees

As explained more fully in the statement of trustees' responsibilities, the trustees, who are also the directors of the
Charitable company for the purpose of company law, are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements
and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the trustees determine is
necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due
to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the trustees are responsible for assessing the charitable company's ability to
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going
concern basis of accounting unless the trustees either intend to liquidate the charitable company or to cease
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance
with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or
error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below.


ROCHDALE TRAINING ASSOCIATION LIMITED

COMPANY LIMITED BY GUARANTEE
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT (CONTINUED)

TO THE MEMBERS OF ROCHDALE TRAINING ASSOCIATION LIMITED

Extent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including

Our approach to identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities
including fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations, was as follows:

* we identified the laws and regulations applicable to the charitable company through discussions with
trustees and other management, and from our commercial knowledge and experience of the charity
sector,

* we focused on specific laws and regulations which we considered may have a direct material effect
on the financial statements or the operations of the charitable company, including the Financial
Reporting Standard (FRS 102), the Statement of Recommended Practice for charities applying FRS
102, the Companies Act 2006, the Charities Act 2011, taxation legislation, health and safety
legislation and all legislation related to educational establishments and apprenticeship providers;

* we assessed the extent of compliance with the laws and regulations identified above through
making enquiries of management; and

* the engagement partner ensured that the engagement team collectively had the appropriate
competence. capabilities and skills to identify or recognise non-compliance with applicable laws and
tegulations;

We assessed the susceptibility of the charitable company's financial statements to material misstatement,
including obtaining an understanding of how fraud might occur, by:

« making enquiries of the trustees and management as to where they considered there was
susceptibility to fraud, their knowledge of actual, suspected and alleged fraud; and

* considering the internal controls in place to mitigate risks of fraud and non-compliance with
laws and regulations

Audit response to risks identified
We addressed detecting material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including fraud and non-compliance with
laws and regulations, as follows:

Risks identified Audit response
Risk of fraud through * performed analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected
management bias and relationships;

override of controls
* tested journal entries to identify unusual transactions;

* assessed whether judgements and assumptions made in determining the
accounting estimates were indicative of potential bias;

* assessed whether judgements and assumptions made in determining the
allocation of funds to the appropriate categories of Unrestricted,
Designated and Restricted funds were indicative of potential bias.

¢ reviewed the controls relating to completeness of income including
sample testing of income transactions to determine appropriate allocation
to the correct accounting period, entitlement and categorisation; and

+ investigated the rationale behind significant or unusual transactions.

Risks identified Audit response
Risk of irregularities and * agreeing financial statement disclosures to underlying supporting
non-compliance with laws documentation

and regulations
« making enquiries of management whether there have been any incidents
or identified non compliance with health and safety, educational and

apprenticeship legislation.

There are inherent limitations in our audit procedures described above. The more removed that laws and
regulations are from financial transactions, the less likely it is that we would become aware of non-compliance.
Auditing standards also limit the audit procedures required to identify non-compliance with laws and regulations to
enquiry of the directors and other management and the inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence, if any.

Material misstatements that arise due to fraud can be harder to detect than those that arise from error as they may
involve deliberate concealment or collusion.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial
Reporting Council's website at https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our
auditor's report.

Use of our report

This report is made solely to the charitable company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16
of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the charitable company's
members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the charitable
company and the charitable company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we

have formed.

Accounting policies

Charity information
Rochdale Training Association Limited is a private company limited by guarantee incorporated in England and
Wales. The registered office is Fishwick Street, Rochdale, Lancashire, OL16 5NA.

Accounting convention

The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the charitable company's Memorandum and
Articles of Association, the Companies Act 2006 and "Accounting and Reporting by Charities: Statement of
Recommended Practice applicable to charities preparing their accounts in accordance with the Financial
Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland (FRS 102) (effective 1 January 2019)". The
charity is a Public Benefit Entity as defined by FRS 102.

The financial statements are prepared in sterling, which is the functional currency of the charitable company.
Monetary amounts in these financial statements are rounded to the nearest £.

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention. The principal accounting
policies adopted are set out below.

Going concern

At the time of approving the financial statements, the trustees have a reasonable expectation that the charity
has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. The charity has
adequate cash reserves and available unrestricted funds. Thus the trustees continue to adopt the going
concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.

Charitable funds

Unrestricted funds are available for use at the discretion of the trustees in furtherance of their charitable
objectives. Unrestricted funds include designated funds where the trustees, at their discretion, have created a
fund for a specific purpose.

Restricted funds are subject to specific conditions by donors as to how they may be used. The purposes and
uses of the restricted funds are set out in the notes to the financial statements.

Incoming resources
Income is recognised when the charitable company is legally entitled to it after any performance conditions
have been met, the amounts can be measured reliably, and it is probable that income will be received.

Donations and legacies income includes membership fees and levies for training from member companies for
the year.

Cash donations are recognised on receipt. Other donations are recognised once the charity has been notified
of the donation, unless performance conditions require deferral of the amount. Income tax recoverable in
relation to donations received under Gift Aid or deeds of covenant is recognised at the time of the donation.

Income from charitable activities, which includes income received under contract where entitlement to grant
funding is subject to specific performance conditions, is recognised as earned as the related support services
are provided. Grant income included in this category provides funding to educational activities and is
recognised where there is entitlement, probability of receipt and amounts can be measured with sufficient
teliability. Income is deferred when performance related grants are received in advance of the education
programme to which they relate.

Investment income is recognised on a receivable basis.

Accounting policies (Continued)

Resources expended

Expenditure is recognised on an accruals basis when a liability is incurred. Contractual arrangements and
performance related grants are recognised as goods or services are supplied. Other grant payments are
recognised as goods or services are supplied. Other grant payments are recognised when a constructive
obligation arises that results in the payment being unavoidable.

- costs of raising funds are those costs incurred in attracting voluntary income, and those incurred in trading
activities that raise funds.

- charitable activities include expenditure incurred when undertaking educational programmes and include
both the direct costs and support costs relating to these activities.

- support costs include central functions and have been allocated to activity cost categories on a basis
consistent with the use of resources, e.g. staff costs by the time spent and other costs by their usage.

Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost or valuation, net of
depreciation and any impairment losses.

Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over their
useful lives on the following bases:

Freehold land and buildings

Freehold land and buildings 4% straight line basis
Plumbing Centre 16 2/3% straight line basis
Plant and machinery

Plant and machinery 15% reducing balance basis
Fixtures and fittings 7 1/2% reducing balance basis
Computers 33 1/3% straight line basis
Motor vehicles 25% reducing balance basis
Office equipment 25% reducing balance basis

The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the sale
proceeds and the carrying value of the asset, and is recognised in the statement of financial activities.

All fixed asset additions are capitalised at cost.

Fixed asset investments

Investments held as fixed assets are revalued at mid-market value at the value at the balance sheet date and
the gain or loss taken to the statement of financial activities. The net cumulative gain or loss is reflected in the
designated fund.

Impairment of fixed assets

At each reporting end date, the charitable company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible assets to
determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such
indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the
impairment loss (if any).

Accounting policies (Continued)

Stocks
Stocks are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value after making due allowance for absolete and
slow moving items.

Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be
incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.

Cash and cash equivalents
Cash at bank and cash in hand includes cash and short term highly liquid investments with a short maturity of
three months or less from the date of acquisition of opening of the deposit or similar account.

Financial instruments
The charitable company has elected to apply the provisions of Section 11 ‘Basic Financial Instruments’ and
Section 12 ‘Other Financial Instruments Issues’ of FRS 102 to all of its financial instruments.

A financial instrument is a contract giving rise to a financial asset (such as trade and other debtors, cash and
bank balances) or a financial liability (such as trade and other creditors, bank and other loans, hire purchase
and lease creditors).

Financial instruments are recognised in the charitable company's balance sheet when the charitable company
becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

All the charitable company financial instruments are basic financial instruments and are recognised at
amorttised cost using the effective interest method.

Amortised cost: the original transaction value, less amounts settled, less any adjustment for impairment.

Effective interest method: where a financial instrument falls due more than 12 months after the balance
sheet date and is subject to a rate of interest which is below a market rate, the original transaction value is
discounted using a market rate of interest to give the net present value of future cash flows.

Derecognition of financial instruments
Financial assets cease to be recognised only when the contractural rights to the cash flows expire, or when
substantially alt the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to another entity.

Financial liabilities are derecognised when the charitable company's contractual obligations expire or are
discharged or cancelled.

Taxation
The company is a registered charity and is entitled to exemption from tax to the extent that income received
falls within Part 11 of the Corporation Taxes Act 2010 and is applied to charitable purposes only.

Employee benefits
The cost of any unused holiday entitlement is recognised in the period in which the employee’s services are
received.

The costs of short-term employee benefits are recognised as a liability and an expense, unless those costs
are required to be recognised as part of the cost of stock or fixed assets.

Retirement benefits
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.

Pensions
Contributions in respect of the charitable company's personal pension scheme are charged to the income and
expenditure account for the year in which they are payable to the scheme.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements

In the application of the charitable company's accounting policies, the trustees are required to make
judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily
apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience
and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting
estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised where the revision affects only that
period, or in the period of the revision and future periods where the revision affects both current and future
periods.
