NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2024

General information

Woodspeen Training Limited is a private company limited by shares incorporated in England and Wales.
The registered office is 3rd Floor, 86-90 Paul Street, London, EC2A 4NE.

Accounting policies

2.1

Basis of preparation of financial statements

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention unless otherwise
specified within these accounting policies and in accordance with FRS 102 ‘The Financial Reporting
Standard applicable in the UK and the Republic of Ireland’ and the requirements of the Companies
Act 2006. The disclosure requirements of Section 1A of FRS 102 have been applied other than
where additional disclosure is required to show a true and fair view.

The preparation of financial statements in compliance with FRS 102 requires the use of certain
critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise judgment in applying the
Company's accounting policies.

Exemption from preparing consolidated financial statements

The Company is a parent company that is also a subsidiary included in the consolidated financial
statements of a larger group by a parent undertaking established under the law of any part of the
United Kingdom and is therefore exempt from the requirement to prepare consolidated financial
statements under section 400 of the Companies Act 2006.

Going concern

The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, notwithstanding net current
liabilities of £221,251 (2023: £273,684), and net assets and net surplus of £433,118 (2023:
£378,661), which the directors believe to be appropriate for the following reasons.

The company is dependent for its working capital on funds provided to it by its fellow group
companies and parent on being able to receive funds in respect of amounts due from group
undertakings and therefore, the directors consider that this company will continue for at least 12
months from the date of signature on the Balance Sheet.

Foreign currency translation

Functional and presentation currency

The Company's functional and presentational currency is GBP.

Transactions and balances

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the spot exchange
rates at the dates of the transactions.

At each period end foreign currency monetary items are translated using the closing rate. Non-
monetary items measured at historical cost are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the
transaction and non-monetary items measured at fair value are measured using the exchange rate
when fair value was determined.

Accounting policies (continued)

2.5

Revenue

Revenue is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for services
provided in the normal course of business, and is shown net of VAT and other sales related taxes.

Revenue from contracts for the provision of consultancy and training services is recognised by
reference to the stage of completion when the stage of completion, costs incurred and costs to
complete can be estimated reliably. The stage of completion is calculated by comparing costs
incurred, mainly in relation to contractual hourly staff rates and materials, as a proportion of total
costs. Where the outcome cannot be estimated reliably, revenue is recognised only to the extent of
the expenses recognised that it is probable will be recovered.

Government grants

Grants are accounted under the accruals model as permitted by FRS 102. Grants relating to
expenditure on tangible fixed assets are credited to profit or loss at the same rate as the depreciation
on the assets to which the grant relates. The deferred element of grants is included in creditors as
deferred income.

Grants of a revenue nature are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the same.
period as the related expenditure.

Pensions
Defined contribution pension plan

The Company operates a defined contribution plan for its employees. A defined contribution plan is a
pension plan under which the Company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. Once the
contributions have been paid the Company has no further payment obligations.

The contributions are recognised as an expense in profit or loss when they fall due. Amounts not paid
are shown in accruals as a liability in the Balance Sheet. The assets of the plan are held separately
from the Company in independently administered funds.

Taxation

Tax is recognised in profit or loss except that a charge attributable to an item of income and expense
tecognised as other comprehensive income or to an item recognised directly in equity is also
recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.

The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of tax rates and laws that have been
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date in the countries where the Company
operates and generates income.

2. Accounting policies (continued)
2.9 Leases

Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the
risks and rewards of ownership to the lessees. All other leases are classified as operating leases.

Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets at cost and then depreciated in line with
the appropriate accounting policy. The related liability is included in the balance sheet as a finance
lease obligation. Lease payments are treated as consisting of capital and interest elements. The
interest is charged to profit or loss so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the
remaining balance of the liability.

Rentals payable under operating leases, including any lease incentives received, are charged to profit
or loss on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease except where another more
systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the
leases asset are consumed.

2.10 Tangible fixed assets

Tangible fixed assets under the cost model are stated at historical cost less accumulated
depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Historical cost includes expenditure that is
directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of
operating in the manner intended by management.

At each reporting date the Company assesses whether there is any indication of impairment. If such
indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is determined which is the higher of its fair
value less costs to sell and its value in use. An impairment loss is recognised where the carrying
amount exceeds the recoverable amount.

Depreciation is charged so as to allocate the cost of assets less their residual value over their
estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method.

Depreciation is provided on the following basis:

Plant and machinery - 4 years
Fixtures and fittings. - 4 years
Computer equipment - 4years

The assets’ residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted
prospectively if appropriate, or if there is an indication of a significant change since the last reporting
date.

Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount
and are recognised in profit or loss.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2024

Accounting policies (continued)

2.11 Fixed asset investments

Interests in subsidiaries are initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost less any
accumulated impairment losses. The investments are assessed for impairment at each reporting
date and any impairment losses or reversals of impairment losses are recognised immediately in
profit or loss.

A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the company. Control is the power to govern the financial and
Operating policies of the entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.

2.12 Debtors

Short-term debtors are measured at transaction price, less any impairment. Loans receivable are
measured initially at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are measured subsequently at amortised
cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment.

2.13 Cash and cash equivalents

Cash is represented by cash in hand and deposits with financial institutions repayable without penalty
on notice of not more than 24 hours. Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments that mature in no
more than three months from the date of acquisition and that are readily convertible to known
amounts of cash with insignificant risk of change in value.

2.14 Creditors

Short-term creditors are measured at the transaction price. Other financial liabilities, including bank
loans, are measured initially at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are measured subsequently at
amortised cost using the effective interest method.

2.15 Provisions for liabilities

Provisions are recognised when an event has taken place that gives rise to a legal or constructive
obligation, a transfer of economic benefits is probable and a reliable estimate can be made. :

Provisions are measured as the best estimate of the amount required to settle the obligation, taking
into account the related risks and uncertainties.

Increases in provisions are generally charged as an expense to profit or loss.

Employees

The average monthly number of employees, including directors, during the year was 155 (2023 - 110).
