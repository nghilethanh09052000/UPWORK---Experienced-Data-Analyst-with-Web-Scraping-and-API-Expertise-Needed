REPORT OF THE TRUSTEES
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2024

The trustees who are also directors of the charity for the purposes of the Companies Act 2006, present their report with
the financial statements of the charity for the year ended 31 August 2024. The trustees have adopted the provisions of
Accounting and Reporting by Charities: Statement of Recommended Practice applicable to charities preparing their
accounts in accordance with the Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland (FRS 102)
(effective 1 January 2019).

OBJECTIVES AND ACTIVITIES

Objectives and aims

SIGTA's objectives, as set out in the Articles of Association, are to promote and advance the education and training of
persons employed or intending to be employed in Industry and Commerce and to extend such training to members of the
public generally.

To achieve the aims of SIGTA, the Board has approved training provision in the following areas:

- Apprentice training in the Engineering and Manufacturing sector covering a broad range of technical occupations.
Business administration and Team Leader apprenticeships are available to individuals employed in the wider business
community. All apprentices managed by SIGTA are employed by the SIGTA member company in which they serve
their apprenticeship. In addition to the management of training, SIGTA promotes apprenticeships as a career choice and
assists applicants to obtain suitable apprentice employment within SIGTA member companies. SIGTA is committed to
developing new opportunities for apprentice training and actively encourages committed employers to join SIGTA.

- Short course training provision for member companies, employers and individuals. These include First Aid training,
Forklift Truck, Health & Safety, Supervisor/Management training and much more.

- Assessment of Qualifications to address the training needs of individuals and employers.

- Training and development advisory services to assist small to medium sized organisations to identify, plan and
implement effective training solutions to meet their business needs and the developmental requirements of individual
staff.

The Board are committed to the delivery of community-based learning, addressing the needs of individuals who
self-refer to SIGTA or are referred by third party organisations. To realise this ambition the Board will continue to
investigate sources of available funding for the delivery of these activities.

Training services are regularly reviewed and updated to ensure they continue to meet the needs of employers and
individuals served by SIGTA.

SIGTA is funded jointly through commercial income generated from the training services provided to member and
non-member organisations and through approved funding streams relating to specific areas of delivery. During the year
ended August 2024 SIGTA accessed Education Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) apprenticeship funding through the
employer apprenticeship service accounts for levy and non-levy paying employers.

The majority of SIGTA’s work takes place across Sussex and Surrey but is not solely restricted to this region.
Public benefit

In shaping our objectives for the year and planning our activities, the trustees have considered the Charity
Commission’s guidance on public benefit, including the guidance public benefit: running a charity (PB2).

REPORT OF THE TRUSTEES
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2024

STRATEGIC REPORT

Achievement and performance

Charitable activities

During the year ended August 2024 SIGTA continued to provide high quality apprenticeship training programmes and
short course provision. These services continued to be well received by employers and learners and resulted in learners
acquiring new skills, knowledge and behaviours. In many cases, this will facilitate employability and future career
progression and were recognised through the achievement of recognised qualifications.

SIGTA's last inspection of apprenticeship provision by Ofsted (Office for Standards in Education) in February 2020,
was judged to be good in all graded areas.

Employers were keen to take on new apprentices and we managed to secure employment for 28 apprentices during the
year.

Due to the ongoing financial impact of reduced apprenticeship recruitment during the COVID period, and the challenge
of returning apprentice numbers to pre-pandemic levels, a further considerable trading loss in this financial year was
seen. All areas of the business have continued to operate and the Board look forward to business growth back to the
volumes seen pre-pandemic.

Financial review

Investment policy and objectives

The board aims to maximise investment return, minimise the risk to invested funds and ensure timely access to sufficient
funds to meet the objectives of the organisation.

Reserves policy

Reserves are maintained to mitigate the risk of a loss of revenue from one of the charity's sources of income and to
enable it to continue to trade for a period of twelve months without recourse to bank financing. The Board believe a
reserve of £400,000 meets this requirement.

Due to the impact of the last three years, it has been necessary to use reserves to enable SIGTA to maintain business
trading. However, we will work towards replenishing the reserves when possible. It was expected that the available
reserves would continue to reduce during the last year, as SIGTA continues to recover from the impact of the Covid-19
pandemic.

The reserve policy will continue to be reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary to reflect current requirements.
The reserves as of 3] August 2024 were £12,892, which has been calculated after deducting fixed assets of £58,534.

Future plans

The principle aim of the charity is to continue to grow and develop its services in the areas of apprenticeship training,
including Engineering, Manufacturing, Business Administration, Team Leading and other areas not currently being
offered, SIGTA's short course provision will continue and be developed further to include courses not currently offered.

Services will continue to be provided to both employed and, subject to the availability of course funding,
community-based learners.

The trustees recognise the need to identify and secure new sources of funding to achieve these aims and to reduce the
risk to the charity that arises from over reliance on single sources of income.

INDEPENDENT EXAMINER'S REPORT TO THE TRUSTEES OF
SIGTA LIMITED

Independent examiner's report to the trustees of SIGTA Limited (‘the Company’)
I report to the charity trustees on my examination of the accounts of the Company for the year ended 31 August 2024.

Responsibilities and basis of report
As the charity's trustees of the Company (and also its directors for the purposes of company law) you are responsible for
the preparation of the accounts in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 (‘the 2006 Act’).

Having satisfied myself that the accounts of the Company are not required to be audited under Part 16 of the 2006 Act
and are eligible for independent examination, I report in respect of my examination of ydur charity's accounts as carried
out under Section 145 of the Charities Act 2011 (‘the 2011 Act"). In carrying out my examination I have followed the
Directions given by the Charity Commission under Section 145(5) (b) of the 201 1 Act.

Independent examiner's statement

Since your charity's gross income exceeded £250,000 your examiner must be a member of a listed body. I can confirm
that I am qualified to undertake the examination because I am a member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in
England and Wales, which is one of the listed bodies.

I have completed my examination. I confirm that no matters have come to my attention in connection with the
examination giving me cause to believe:

accounting records were not kept in respect of the Company as required by Section 386 of the 2006 Act; or

the accounts do not accord with those records; or

the accounts do not comply with the accounting requirements of Section 396 of the 2006 Act other than any
requirement that. the accounts give a true and fair view which is not a matter considered as part of an independent
examination; or

4. the accounts have not been prepared in accordance with the methods and principles of the Statement of
Recommended Practice for accounting and reporting by charities (applicable to charities preparing their accounts
in accordance with the Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland (FRS 102)).

wnNne

I have no concerns and have come across no other matters in connection with the examination to which attention should
be drawn in this report in order to enable a proper understanding of the accounts to be reached.

Financial Reporting Standard 102 ‘The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of
Ireland' and the Companies Act 2006. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost
convention, with the exception of investments which are included at market value, as modified by the revaluation

is probable that the income will be received and the amount can be measured reliably.

Turnover is the amount derived for the provision of training services and is stated net of VAT.
Interest income

Interest on funds held on deposit is included when receivable and the amount can be
measured reliably by the charity; this is normally upon notification of the interest paid or

Expenditure

Liabilities are recognised as expenditure as soon as there is a legal or constructive obligation committing the
charity to that expenditure, it is probable that a transfer of economic benefits will be required in settlement and
the amount of the obligation can be measured reliably. Expenditure is accounted for on an accruals basis and has
been classified under headings that aggregate all cost related to the category. Where costs cannot be directly
attributed to particular headings they have been allocated to activities on a basis consistent with the use of
resources.

Tangible fixed assets
Depreciation is provided at the following annual rates in order to write off each asset over its estimated useful
life.

Freehold property - building 2% on cost, land nil

Plant and machinery - 33% on cost and 15% on reducing balance

Motor vehicles - 25% on reducing balance and 15% on reducing balance
Stocks

Stocks are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value, after making due allowance for obsolete and slow
moving items.

Taxation
The charity is exempt from corporation tax on its charitable activities.

Fund accounting
Unrestricted funds can be used in accordance with the charitable objectives at the discretion of the trustees.

Restricted funds can only be used for particular restricted purposes within the objects of the charity. Restrictions
arise when specified by the donor or when funds are raised for particular restricted purposes.

Further explanation of the nature and purpose of each fund is included in the notes to the financial statements.
