Metroline Limited

Strategic report
The Directors, in preparing this Strategic report, have complied with s414C of the Companies Act 2006.

This Strategic report has been prepared for the Metroline Limited and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) as a whole and
therefore gives greater emphasis to those matters which are significant to the Group and its subsidiary undertakings
when viewed as a whole. :

Principal Activities

The Group’s principal activity during the year continued to be the provision of road passenger transport services,
principally in London through operating tendered Transport for London (“TfL”) routes.

Section 172(1) Statement

The Directors of the Company recognise their duty to promote the success of the Company for the benefit of its
members as a whole whilst having due regard to the matters set out in section s172(1) of the Companies Act 2006:

The likely consequences of any decision in the long term

The interests of the company’s employees

The need to foster the company’s business relationships with suppliers, customers and others
The impact of the company’s operations on the community and the environment

The desirability of the company maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct
The need to act fairly as between members of the company

In providing class leading passenger transport services the Group works closely with a range of stakeholders without
which the operating businesses would not succeed. This includes TfL (Transport for London), with whom we work
in partnership in delivering passenger transport services within London. Meetings with a range of stakeholders are
held regularly at all levels of the company’s organisation with decisions taken with reference to their impact on
relationships and sustainability.

The passenger transport services the Group provides are key requirements of the local communities that they serve,
without which residents would not be able to travel to their places of work or leisure as efficiently and cost
effectively. Concessionary pass holders rely on the services we operate to provide a means of reliable transport that
helps to support mobility and quality of life.

The Group is also proud of its ongoing investment in its fleet of vehicles improving emission standards as well as
enlarging its fleet of zero emission buses that are contributing to the cleaner air agenda and long term climate change
mitigation in the communities the operating companies serve.

The way the Group deals with employee engagement is dealt with in the Directors’ report under Employee
consultation (page 6). .

Additional information in respect of the Board, Directors, consideration of Stakeholders and their engagement is
provided in the following sections of the corporate governance statement (page 2): Board Composition, Director
Responsibilities, Stakeholder relationships and engagement.

Corporate Governance Statement

The ultimate parent company, ComfortDelGro Corporation Limited, which is listed on the Singapore Stock
Exchange is committed and adheres to the Code of Corporate Governance issued by the Monetary Authority of
Singapore dated 6 August 2018 and ensures that it is upheld throughout the Group. Details of the corporate
governance practices are set out within ComfortDelGro Corporation Limited Annual Report available on the
ComfortDelGro website.

As a wholly owned subsidiary of the listed ComfortDelGro Corporation Limited, Metroline Limited did not follow
a formalised Corporate Governance Code in the financial year to 31 December 2023, however the Company
voluntarily complied with the Wates Corporate Governance Principles for large private companies as follows:

1. Purpose and leadership — The Metroline Board determines the long term strategy, direction and performance of
Metroline. Our vision is to be the Land Transport Operator of choice in the markets that we operate in and the Board
are responsible for ensuring the values, strategy and culture are aligned with that vision.

Metroline Limited

Strategic report (continued)
Corporate Governance Statement (continued)

2. Board composition — The Metroline Limited Board comprises of the Group CEO and Deputy Group CEO of
ComfortDelGro Corporation Limited, as well as the CEO for ComfortDelGro Europe and Metroline CEO.

3. Director responsibilities - The Metroline Board ensure that the local businesses are aligned with Shareholder
Interests and with the policies and directions of the wider Group. The Metroline CEO has the operational
.tesponsibility for delivery of the business plans and meeting the objectives set by the Board. Directors acknowledge
their duties to promote the success of the company as set out in the Section 172 (1) Statement on page 2.

4. Opportunity and risk — The Metroline Board seek out opportunity while mitigating risk. Long term strategic
opportunities are highlighted to the Board through regular Board meetings and through the Group Business
Development function. The Metroline Board and the ComfortDelGro Risk & Sustainability Office ensure that
inherent and emerging risks are identified and managed appropriately and in a timely manner updating the overall
Group Risk Register for any changes in underlying conditions. Risks are managed at a local level through Operational
and Safety Risk Committees and through the regular reporting and investigation of incidents. The Safety of our
Passengers and Staff are the number one priority in all that we do.

5. Remuneration — Sean O’Shea and Damian Rowbotham were remunerated by the Metroline Group of Companies.
An amount of £10,000 was paid to Mr Lim Jit Poh for his services to Braddell Group. The remuneration of all other
Directors are shown in the Accounts of the ultimate holding company, ComfortDelGro Corporation Limited.

6. Stakeholder relationships and engagement — Directors foster effective stakeholder relationships aligned to the
company’s purpose of being the Land Transport Operator of choice. This requires both the Board and Senior
Management to engage with a range of Stakeholders in order to deliver financial returns and growth in a sustainable
way.

Stakeholders include employees, passengers, suppliers, customers including local authorities, devolved assemblies
and Regulators such as Transport for London, Department for Transport and the Office of the Traffic Commissioner.

Engagement takes many forms including local briefings and regular communication with Staff via in-house tools
such as Blink and newsletters. ,

For other stakeholders such as our customers and local authorities, formal meetings and daily dialogue take place
with key stakeholder representatives.

Financial results and future prospects

2023 was another challenging year for Metroline, with inflationary pressures impacting the cost base. Fuel prices
remained relatively high throughout most of the year and driver pay continued to rise at a higher rate than revenue.
A continued lack of bus drivers, as seen across other bus operators in London, impacted the level of contract mileage
covered, triggering penalties from Metroline’s main customer Transport for London (TfL). Metroline covered some
of the staffing gap through high levels of overtime and agency staff.

Total revenue for the Group has increased slightly quicker than total costs in the year, as a result of new contract
awards and annual price increases for existing contracts. Whilst TfL contract prices are indexed based on consumer
price index (CPI) inflation as reported by the Office for National Statistics, contract price increases occur annually
leading to a disconnect between revenue and costs during periods of rising inflation. In the second half of the year
Metroline started to benefit through higher contract price increases as a result of the previous period of high inflation.
With CPI continuing to fall, revenue is expected to increase quicker than costs leading to an improving profit position
through 2024.

As shown in the Group’s consolidated income statement on page 13, the Group’s revenue has increased by £7.0m
(2.0%) in the year to £350.8m (2022: £343.8m) with pre-tax loss of £21.7m (2022: £2.0m loss after crediting a gain
on disposal of property of £20.4m).

The results of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2023 show a loss after Tax of £13.5m (2022: £0.2m profit).
The Group has net assets of £216.6m (2022: £233.0m).

Metroline Limited

Strategic report (continued)
Financial results and future prospects (continued)
Future outlook

As the UK continues to return to new normality following Covid-19, we have seen passenger numbers returning to
the bus network. However, the pandemic and trends of increased homeworking has led to changes in habits for
commuters, with fewer weekday travellers and more weekend travellers. The bus industry, similar to many other
businesses in the service industry has suffered from a lack of frontline resourcing, which has impacted customer
service and triggered financial penalties in the year. As indicated in the Future Outlook section of the 2022 Financial
Statements, operating costs exceeded revenue in 2023, but as contract prices continue to increase and the bus industry
stabilises, we expect to see an improving financial position into 2024 and beyond. Whilst inflation through 2023 was
higher than anticipated, therefore delaying a turnaround of Metroline’s overall financial position, the outlook for
2024 remains positive.

The Company intends to continue the provision of passenger transport services. Expansion is being targeted through
tendering for TfL contracts, as they become available.

Principal risks and uncertainties

Competitive pressure in the regulated London market is a continuing risk for the Group, which could result in the
loss of routes to key competitors. The Group manages this risk by constantly striving to improve the quality of its
services and by having a spread of route contracts with varying expiry dates. Contract awards through have been
positive, with 18 contracts retained, 4 new contracts won and 2 contracts lost. These will positively impact 2024.

The number and size of insurance claims falling within the Company’s self-insured excess and policy terms with
these risks are managed through passenger and employee safety programs. The group self-insures its fleet of buses
against claims in respect of traffic accidents, subject to an overall annual limit to its liability. The directors have
recognised as a liability in the accounts the undiscounted financial impact of the expected resolution of any
outstanding claims on the basis of information currently available. The vast majority of claims are likely to be settled
within five years although in a small number of cases it may take significantly longer for the final amount of liability
to be established.

Metroline has maintained good employee and industrial relationships through 2023, with a particular focus on driver
recruitment and retention. A planned employee engagement survey will be launched in the first half of 2024 to further
support improving these relationships.

Cyber risks pose a significant and increasing risk for all businesses with the increasing reliance on digital technology
and data storage. Metroline monitors and manages incoming and outgoing emails through the use of IT security
software and minimises the access onto the Metroline IT infrastructure. Regular proactive training is provided for
employees and additional business protection solutions under review.

Key Performance Indicators

The overall performance of the business is measured in financial terms in conjunction with non-financial metrics
that are used in assessing operational performance.

Financial 2023 = 2022

Turnover (£ms) 350.8 343.8

Operating (Loss) (£ms) (19.8) (1.9)

Operating (Loss) Margin(%) (5.7%) (0.6%)

Non-Financial 2023 2022 Definition

Operated Mileage percentage 98.6% 97.9% Level of mileage under contract delivered

Operated Mileage 47.0m 49.0m_ Total contracted mileage operated

Net Route Awards +2 +1 New Routes awarded net of routes lost through tendering

Reduced contracted mileage operated of 4.0% down to 47.0m miles was due to the combination of 4.6% loss of
scheduled mileage through contract changes and 0.6% more of the scheduled mileage covered.

Directors' responsibilities statement

The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with
applicable law and regulations.

Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the
directors have elected to prepare the group financial statements in accordance with UK adopted International
Accounting Standards and the parent company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law), including FRS 101
‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’. Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless
they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of
the Company for that period.

In preparing the parent company financial statements, the directors are required to:

select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures
disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and

¢ prepare the financial statements on the going concer basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the
company will continue in business.

In preparing the Group financial statements, International Accounting Standard 1 requires that directors:

properly select and apply accounting policies;
present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and
understandable information;

* provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to
enable users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity's
financial position and financial performance; and

* make an assessment of the Company's ability to continue as a going concem,

The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company
and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF METROLINE LIMITED

Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of Metroline Limited (‘the parent company’) and its subsidiaries
(the ‘group’) for the year ended 31 December 2023 which comprise the Consolidated Income Statement,
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Statement of Financial position,
Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, Company Statement of Financial Position, Company
Statement of Changes in Equity and Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows and the related notes 1 to
26, including material accounting policy information. The financial reporting framework that has been
applied in the preparation of the group financial statements is applicable law and UK adopted
international accounting standards. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the
preparation of the parent company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom
Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework” (United Kingdom Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice).

In our opinion:

e the financial statements give a true and fair view of the group's and of the parent company’s
affairs as at 31 December 2023 and of the group’s loss for the year then ended;

e — the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK adopted
international accounting standards;

e the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and

e the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the
Companies Act 2006.

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and
applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's
responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the
group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial
statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard and we have fulfilled our other ethical
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for
our opinion.

Conclusions relating to going concern

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern
basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to
events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group and parent
company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of 12 months from when the financial
statements are authorised for issue.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described
in the relevant sections of this report. However, because not all future events or conditions can be
predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the group's ability to continue as a going concern.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF METROLINE LIMITED (continued)

Other information

The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial
statements and our auditor's report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information
contained within the annual report.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent
otherwise explicitly stated in this report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other
information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the
course of the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material
inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives
rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have
performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other information, we are required
to report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.

Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

e the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which
the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and

e the strategic report and directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal
requirements.

Matters on which we are required to report by exception

In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the parent company and its
environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the
strategic report or directors’ report.

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act
2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
¢ adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been
received from branches not visited by us; or
« the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and
returns; or
certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF METROLINE LIMITED (continued)
Responsibilities of directors

As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 8, the directors are
responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true
and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the
preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or
error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group's and the
parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to
going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to
liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to
do so.

Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an
audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on
the basis of these financial statements.

Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities,
including fraud

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design
procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect irregularities, including fraud. The
tisk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one
resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional
misrepresentations, or through collusion. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting
irregularities, including fraud is detailed below. However, the primary responsibility for the prevention
and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the entity and management.

Our approach was as follows:

e We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the
group and company and determined that the most significant are those that relate to the reporting
framework (IFRS, FRS 101 and the Companies Act 2006) and the relevant direct and indirect tax
compliance regulation in the United Kingdom. In addition, the group has to comply with laws and
regulations relating to its operations including health and safety, employees, data protection and
anti-bribery and corruption practices.

e We understood how the group is complying with those frameworks by making inquiries of
management to understand how the group and parent company maintain and communicate their
policies and procedures in these areas. We corroborated our inquiries through our review of
supporting documentation as well as the results of our other audit procedures. :

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF METROLINE LIMITED (continued)

Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities,
including fraud (continued)

« We assessed the susceptibility of the group's and company’s financial statements to material
misstatement, including how fraud might occur by inquiry of management, those charged with
governance and others within the group and parent company, as to whether they have knowledge
of any actual or suspected fraud. Where the risk was considered higher, we performed audit
procedures to address the fraud risk. We performed journal entry testing with a focus on manual
journals including large or unusual transactions based on our understanding of the business.

e Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify noncompliance with such
laws and regulations. Our procedures involved reading minutes of board meetings and analytical
reviews.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the
Financial Reporting Council's website at https:/Awww.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description
forms part of our auditor’s report.

Use of our report

This report is made solely to the company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part
16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the
company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no
other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to
anyone other than the company and the company's members as a body, for our audit work, for this
report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Notes to the financial statements
- Year ended 31 December 2023

General information

Metroline Limited (Registration no. 02826284) is a private company limited by shares registered in England and
Wales and incorporated in the United Kingdom with registered office at ComfortDelGro House, 329 Edgware
Road, Cricklewood, London NW2 6JP. Metroline Limited is a subsidiary of Braddell Limited, an investment
holding company for its parent company ComfortDelGro Corporation Limited in Singapore. Information on its
ultimate parent is presented in note 24.

The operating companies provide road passenger transport services, principally London through operating
tendered routes from Transport for London.

The consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2023 (including
comparatives) and the statement of financial position and statement of changes in equity for the Company were
approved and authorised for issue by the board of directors on 16 September 2024.

Summary of material accounting policies

Basis of preparation

The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with UK adopted
international accounting standards and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 that are applicable.

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for hedging
instruments that have been measured at fair value. The consolidated financial statements are presented in GBP
and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand (£'000), except when otherwise indicated.

The Company’s individual financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 101 “Reduced
Disclosure Framework”. As permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure
exemptions available under that standard in relation to the following disclosures:

¢ — financial instruments,

© capital management,

¢ presentation of comparative information in respect of certain assets,
© presentation of a cash flow statement,

¢ — standards not yet effective,

¢ impairment of assets

e related party transactions.

Where relevant, equivalent disclosures have been given in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

The principal accounting policies are summarised below. They have all been applied consistently throughout
the year and the preceding year, unless otherwise stated.

Going concern

The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance
and position are set out in the Strategic report on page 2. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows,
liquidity position and borrowing facilities are also described in further detail in the notes to the financial
statements. The directors are satisfied with the results and believe that the Group is well placed to manage its
business risks successfully.

Metroline Limited

Notes to the financial statements
Year ended 31 December 2023

2.

Summary of material accounting policies (continued)

Going concern (continued)

In particular, although the Group is exposed to wider macroeconomic events, the directors have given due
consideration to the fact that the Group benefits from strong, predictable cash flows from the long-term contracts
with government bodies which provide a substantial majority of its revenues. The Group’s forecasts and
projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, including reasonable worst
case assumptions, show that the Group should be able to continue to operate within the level of the resources
available to it.

Management believes that the Company has access to adequate financial resources to continue in operational
existence for the foreseeable future. This has been assessed by reviewing forecasts that take into account
forecasts for future contracts through TfL and price changes as a result of moving to zero emissions vehicles.

ComfortDelGro Corporation Limited continue to support the business and as a result, management expects to
have sufficient cash resources and cash generating operations through 2024 and beyond.

Management believes that there are significant and varied sources of additional financial facilities from existing
banking relationships in the event that they would be required to provide management with additional confidence
in adopting the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.

ComfortDelGro Corporation Limited has provided a letter of support to Metroline Limited and its subsidiaries
stating that they will assist the Group in meeting its liabilities as and when they fall due for a period of 12 months
from the date of approval of these financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023. The Directors
have no reason to believe that a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on the ability of
ComfortDelGro Corporation Limited to honour the letter of ongoing financial support

Basis of consolidation

The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and all of its subsidiaries as of 31 December
2023. Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the power to control the financial and operating
policies. The Group obtains and exercises control through more than half of the voting rights. All subsidiaries
have a reporting date of 31 December.

All transactions and balances between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation, including unrealised
gains and losses on transactions between Group companies. Where unrealised losses on intra-group asset sales
are reversed on consolidation, the underlying asset is also tested for impairment from a group perspective.
Amounts reported in the financial statements of subsidiaries have been adjusted where necessary to ensure
consistency with the accounting policies adopted by the Group.

Profit or loss and other comprehensive income of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are
recognised from the effective date of acquisition, or up to the effective date of disposal, as applicable.

Business combinations and goodwill

The Group applies the acquisition method in accounting for business combinations. The consideration
transferred by the Group to obtain control of a subsidiary is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair
values of assets transferred, liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group, which includes the
fair value of any asset or liability arising from a contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisition costs are
expensed as incurred.

The Group recognises identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination regardless
of whether they have been previously recognised in the acquiree’s financial statements prior to the acquisition.
Assets acquired and liabilities assumed are generally measured at their acquisition-date fair values.

24

Metroline Limited

Notes to the financial statements
Year ended 31 December 2023

2.

Summary of material accounting policies (continued)

Business combinations and goodwill (continued)

Goodwill is stated after separate recognition of identifiable intangible assets. It is calculated as the excess of the
sum of a) fair value of consideration transferred and b) acquisition-date fair value of any existing equity interest
in the acquiree, over the acquisition-date fair values of identifiable net assets. If the fair values of identifiable
net assets exceed the sum calculated above, the excess amount (i.e. gain on a bargain purchase) is recognised in
profit or loss immediately.

The cost of goodwill in the financial statements held at date of transition has been measured at its amortised
book value under previous UK GAAP at the date of transition to IFRS. Goodwill is tested for impairment at
each reporting date and provision is made for any impairment identified.

After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose
of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to
each of the Group’s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of
whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units. ©

Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost or valuation less accumulated depreciation and
provision for impairment.

Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment, other than freehold land, at rates calculated to
write off the cost or valuation, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight-line basis over its
expected useful economic life, as follows:

Freehold buildings 50 years

Buses 12 to 14 years

Plant and machinery 1 to 10 years

Leasehold land and leasehold improvements Over the life of the lease
investments

Investments held as non-current assets are stated at cost less provision for any impairment in value.
Inventories

Inventories consist primarily of materials required for the operation and maintenance of buses. These materials
are valued on an average cost basis at the lower of cost and net realisable value to the group.

Taxation

Income tax expense in profit or loss comprises the sum of current and deferred tax. It is recognised in profit or
loss except to the extent that it relates to a business combination, or items recognised directly in equity or in
other comprehensive income.

Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or
recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the statement of
financial position date.

Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the
consolidated financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profits.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are
generally recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits
will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such deferred tax assets
and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition (other than in a
business combination) of assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the
accounting profit. In addition, deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from
the initial recognition of goodwill.

Metroline Limited

Notes to the financial statements
Year ended 31 December 2023

Summary of material accounting policies (continued)

Taxation (continued)

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is
no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to
be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the
extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the
asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively
enacted at the reporting date.

Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss. Deferred tax
items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in other comprehensive income or directly

in equity.
Retirement benefit obligations

The Group operates two defined benefit pension schemes for certain employees, the assets of which are held in
trustee administered funds. The related pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of a qualified
actuary on the basis of final pensionable earnings. The regular cost is attributed to individual periods using the
projected unit credit method, The schemes are now closed to new members.

The differences between the fair value of the assets held in the Group’s defined benefit pension schemes and the
schemes’ liabilities measured on an actuarial basis using projected unit method are recognised in the Group’s
statement of financial position as a pension scheme asset or liability as appropriate.

The carrying value of any resulting pension scheme asset is restricted to the extent that the Group is able to
recover the surplus either through reduced contributions in the future or through refunds from the scheme. The
pension scheme balance is recognised net of any related deferred tax balance.

Changes in the defined benefit pension scheme asset or liability arising from factors other than cash contribution
by the Group are charged to profit or loss or the statement of other comprehensive income in accordance with
TAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’.

Scheme administration expenses are included within operating profit. Net interest expense or income is
calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit asset or liability and included within net
finance costs. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income.
Actuarial gains and losses include the difference between the actual return on assets (net of investment
administration costs and taxes, such as amounts levied by the UK Pension Protection Fund) and the discount
rates applied to the assets. Mortality rates are considered when retirement benefit obligations are calculated.

The Group also operates a defined contribution pension scheme, the assets of which are held separately from
those of the Group and are managed by a third party. Contributions are charged in the Income Statement as they
become payable in accordance with the rules of the scheme.

Insurance and provision for accident claims and other provisions

Insurance costs include insurance premiums which are recognised in the Income Statement over the period to
which they relate. Included in provisions is an estimate of the liability for uninsured retained risks on unpaid
claims arising out of events occurring up to the statement of financial position date. Other provisions have been
assessed by management for property related and legal costs.

Provision for making good certain property dilapidations has been considered and assessed by management for
those which are anticipated to fall due within the next twelve months and those due after twelve months.

Provision is also made for certain bus modifications to comply with ongoing emissions standards. As with
dilapidations provisions, an assessment is made by management as to the value and timing of when such costs
will be incurred.

Summary of material accounting policies (continued)
Revenue

The Group follows the principles of IFRS 15 in determining appropriate revenue recognition policies. Revenue
represents amounts receivable for services provided in the normal course of business, net of trade discounts,
VAT and other sales related taxes. Revenue from the supply of services represents the value of services provided
under contracts to the extent that there is a right to consideration and is recorded at the value of the consideration
due. Where a contract has only been partially completed at the statement of financial position date, revenue
represents the value of the service provided to date based on a proportion of the total contract value. Where
payments are received from customers in advance of services provided, the amounts are recorded as deferred
income and included as part of current liabilities.

Revenue from services is recognised following the principles outlined in IFRS 15’s five step model as detailed
below.

. Identifying the contract.

Upon acceptance of a proposal, a contract is entered into, to include details on the scope of work and each party’s
tights and obligations regarding the transfer of the service as well as payment terms for the service being
transferred.

‘ Identifying the performance obligations in the contract

Key deliverables are stated in the contract and monitored on an ongoing basis against the agreed delivery
timetable. The contract states our obligations to the client. In assessing performance obligations, consideration
is given as to whether each identified key deliverable is a separate performance obligation, or a series of services
that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer so as to form one overall
performance obligation. Where contracts have multiple components to be delivered, those components may
work in conjunction with one another and therefore the client may be unable to benefit from each component
individually. In the instances where there are two distinct groups of components that can be delivered and
measured separately, we would recognise as two separate performance obligations.

. Determining the transaction price

Each contract has a section describing fees and will state the invoicing profile (i.e. the value and frequency) of
the invoices to be raised. The transaction price is developed during the proposal process through establishing
the scope of the work and the resources required to deliver that work. Upon acceptance the total fee value is
stated in the contract and is also broken down into an invoicing schedule. For all variable consideration we
consider revenue recognition based on the most likely amount we will receive. Invoicing is generally fortnightly
and is in general designed to reflect the progress made on projects.

Revenue is recognised on a fortnightly basis in accordance with services delivered in the period. For all variable
consideration revenue is recognised monthly based on the likely amount expected to be received at the end of
the contract year.

Given that the Group has a right to consideration from a customer in an amount that corresponds directly with
the value to the customer completed to date and variable consideration recognised is for not greater than 12
months, the practical expedient not to disclose information about transaction price allocated to remaining
performance obligations has been applied. The Group has also applied the practical expedient not to disclose
the incremental costs of obtaining a contract.

Management have assessed the revenue recognition policy in line with the specified 5 step model and have
identified that no changes in the revenue recognition criteria are required under IFRS 15. Management continue
to closely monitor each new contract to ensure that the 5 step approach is applied.

Summary of material accounting policies (continued)
Revenue (continued)

The Group has a number of revenue streams which consist of revenue from passengers, contracts, as well as
other miscellaneous revenue streams. Revenue is recognised on satisfaction of performance obligations which
are generally clear. Revenue is measured based on the fair value of the consideration received or receivable
(excluding discounts, rebates, VAT and other sales taxes or duty) to which the Group expects to be entitled to
and excludes amounts collected on behaif of third parties.

Passenger revenue

Passenger revenue mainly relates to revenue from ticket sales in the bus routes operating outside of London.
Outside of London passenger revenue mainly consists of commercial and concessionary revenue. Commercial
passenger revenue relates to ticket sales for travel on the bus & coach transport services and is recognised in the
period in which the travel occurs. Season tickets and travel cards enable passengers to use travel services over a
period of time. Concessionary revenue is received from public bodies, such as local authorities, with a
performance obligation to transport certain eligible passengers free of charge. Revenue is recognised in the
period of travel and the transaction price varies between agreements and can include areas of estimation.

Revenue is only recognised when the amount can be measured reliably and it is highly probable that a significant
reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue will not occur.

Contract revenue

Contract revenue mainly relates to the London bus division and comprises contractual income from government
bodies which are recognised in the period to which they relate. Quality incentive contracts (QICs) are received
as part of the contract revenue and the potential premiums or penalties are assessed cumulatively on a contract
by contract basis, at the end of each period based on key performance obligations. The whole of cumulative
penalties/premiums are recognised in the income statement on a pro rata basis to the contract year.

Outside of the London TfL business, revenue generated from services provided on behalf of local transport
authorities as well as private hire customers is also recognised as income in the period to which it relates.

Other revenue

Other revenue mainly relates to revenue for ancillary services, such as rail replacement and engineering services. ©
Other revenue is recognised in the period to which it relates, for the transaction price specified in the contract.

The Group have recognised revenue where the amount can be measured reliably and it is highly probable that a
significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue will not occur. Given the uncertainty of the outcome
of the reconciliation process, no reliable estimate for recognition can be made for any additional potential
receipts that may be due.

Summary of material accounting policies (continued)

Government grants

Government grants are not recognised until there is reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with the
conditions attaching to them and that the grants will be received.

Government grants are recognised in profit or loss on a systematic basis over the periods in which the Group
recognises as expenses the related costs for which the grants are intended to compensate. Specifically,
government grants whose primary condition is that the Group should purchase, construct or otherwise acquire
non-current assets (including property, plant and equipment) are recognised as deferred income in the
consolidated statement of financial position and transferred to profit or loss on a systematic and rational basis
over the useful lives of the related assets.

Government grants that are receivable as compensation for expenses or losses already incurred or for the purpose
of giving immediate financial support to the Group with no future related costs are recognised in profit or loss
in the period in which they become receivable.

The benefit of a government loan at a below-market rate of interest is treated as a government grant, measured
as the difference between proceeds received and the fair value of the loan based on prevailing market interest
tates.

Foreign currency transactions

Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction. Monetary
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the statement of financial position date are reported at
the rates of exchange prevailing at that date. All exchange differences are included in the Income Statement.

Financial instruments

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a principal party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument.

Trade and other receivables

Trade and other receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Appropriate
allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in the Income Statement when there is objective
evidence that the asset is impaired. The allowance recognised is measured as the difference between the asset’s
carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate.

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at banks and on hand and cash in deposit accounts which require less
than three months’ notice for the Company to access. In the current and prior period all amounts relate to cash
at bank and on hand.

Trade and other payables

Trade and other payables are measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.

Equity instruments

Equity instruments issued by the company are recorded when the proceeds are received net of direct issue costs.
Hedging instruments and hedge accounting

The Group uses hedging instruments to manage its exposure to fuel price fluctuation, foreign currency
movements and interest rate risks. The use of hedging instruments is governed by the ultimate parent company's
policies which provide written principles on the use of financial instruments consistent with its risk management
strategy (refer to note 21).

Summary of material accounting policies (continued)
Financial instruments (continued)
Hedging instruments and hedge accounting (continued)

Hedging instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the contract date and are subsequently remeasured
to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss
immediately unless the hedging instrument is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event
the timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship. The Group
designates its hedging instruments as cash flow hedges.

Hedging instruments are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is
negative. The fair value of hedging instrument is classified as a non-current asset or non-current liability if the
maturity of the hedge relationship exceeds 12 months and as a current asset or current liability if the maturity of
the hedge relationship is within 12 months.

At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument
and hedged item, along with its risk management objective and its strategy for undertaking various hedge
transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether
the hedging instrument is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item.

The Group designates any interest rate swap for hedging of interest rate risk arising from borrowings as cash
flow hedges. Hedges of foreign currency risk for future purchases of goods are designated as cash flow hedges.
Hedges of fuel price risk for future purchases of goods are also designated as cash flow hedges.

Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument
expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.

Note 21 contains details of the fair value of the hedging instruments.
Cash flow hedge

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments that are designated and qualify as
cash flow hedges are recognised in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective
portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss. Amounts recognised in other comprehensive income are
taken to profit or loss when the hedged item is realised. The cash flow hedging reserves reported in the
consolidated statement of changes in equity represent the fair value of the hedging instruments net of deferred
tax.

Impairment review of goodwill, other intangibles and property, plant and equipment

For impairment assessment purposes, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are largely
independent cash inflows (cash-generating units). As a result, some assets are tested individually for impairment
and some are tested at cash-generating unit level. Goodwill is allocated to those cash-generating units that are
expected to benefit from synergies of the related business combination and represent the lowest level within the
Group at which management monitors goodwill.

Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated (determined by the Group’s management as
equivalent to its operating segments) are tested for impairment at least annually. All other individual assets or
cash-generating units are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount may not be recoverable.

An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s or cash-generating unit’s carrying amount
exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use. To determine
the value-in-use, management estimates expected future cash flows from each cash-generating unit and
determines a suitable interest rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. The data used for
impairment testing procedures are directly linked to the Group’s latest approved budget, adjusted as necessary
to exclude the effects of future reorganisations and asset enhancements. Discount factors are determined
individually for each cash-generating unit and reflect management’s assessment of respective risk profiles, such
as market and asset-specific risk factors.

Summary of material accounting policies (continued)
Impairment review of goodwill, other intangibles and property, plant and equipment (continued)

Impairment losses for cash-generating units reduce first the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to that
cash-generating unit. Any remaining impairment loss is charged pro rata to the other assets in the cash-generating
unit. With the exception of goodwill, all assets are subsequently reassessed for indications that an impairment
loss previously recognised may no longer exist. An impairment charge is reversed if the cash-generating unit’s
recoverable amount exceeds its carrying amount.

Leases

All leases are accounted for by recognising a right-of-use asset and a lease liability except for:
e Leases of low value assets; and
« Leases with a duration of 12 months or less.

The Group as lessee

The group assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease, at inception of the contract. The group recognises
a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability with respect to all lease arrangements in which it is the
lessee, except for short-term leases (defined as leases with a lease term of 12 months or less) and leases of low
value assets. For these leases, the group recognises the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line
basis over the term of the lease unless another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in
which economic benefits from the leased assets are consumed.

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the
commencement date, discounted by using the rate implicit in the lease. If this rate cannot be readily determined,
the group uses the incremental borrowing rate specific to the lessee.

Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise:

. fixed lease payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives;

. variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate, initially measured using the index or rate at the
commencement date;

. the amount expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees;

. the exercise price of purchase options, if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise the options; and

. payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the exercise of an option to

terminate the lease.

The lease liability is subsequently measured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease
liability (using the effective interest method) and by reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments
made.

The lease liability is presented as a separate line in the statement of financial position.

Sunimary of material accounting policies (continued)
Leases (continued)

The Group remeasures the lease liability (and makes a corresponding adjustment to the related right-of-use asset)
whenever: :

. the lease term has changed or there is a significant event or change in circumstances resulting in a change
in the assessment of exercise of a purchase option, in which case the lease liability is remeasured by
discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate; or

: the lease payments change due to changes in an index or rate or a change in expected payment under a

. guaranteed residual value, in which cases the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease
payments using the initial discount rate (unless the lease payments change is due to a change in a floating
interest rate, in which case a revised discount rate is used); or

. a lease contract is modified and the lease modification is not accounted for as a separate lease, in which
case the lease liability is remeasured by. discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount
rate at the effective date of the modification.

Right-of-use assets are depreciated over the shorter period of lease term and useful life of the underlying asset.
If a lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the group
expects to exercise a purchase option, the related right-of-use asset is depreciated over the useful life of the
underlying asset. The depreciation starts at the commencement date of the lease.

The right-of-use assets are presented as a separate line in the statement of financial position.

Adoption of new and revised standards

The following amendments to standards have been adopted for the first time in these financial statements.
Deferred tax relating to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction (amendments to IAS 12)

The company has adopted the amendments to IAS 12 for the first time in the current year. The amendments
introduce a further exception from the initial recognition exemption. Under the amendments, an entity does not
apply the initial recognition exemption for transactions that give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary
differences. Depending on the applicable tax law, equal taxable and deductible temporary differences may
arise on initial recognition of an asset and liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and
affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit.

Following the amendments to IAS 12, an entity is required to recognise the related deferred tax asset and
liability, with the recognition of any deferred tax asset being subject to the recoverability criteria in IAS 12.

Adoption of new and revised standards (continued)
International Tax Reform — Pillar Two Model Rules (Amendments to IAS 12)

The scope of IAS 12 is amended to clarify that the Standard applies to income taxes arising from tax law enacted
or substantively enacted to implement the Pillar Two model rules published by the OECD, including tax law
that implements qualified domestic minimum top-up taxes described in those rules.

The amendments introduce a temporary exception to the accounting requirements for deferred taxes in IAS 12,
so that an entity would neither recognise nor disclose information about deferred tax assets and liabilities retated
to Pillar Two income taxes.

The assessment of the potential exposure to Pillar Two income taxes is based on the most recent tax filings,
country-by-country reporting, and financial statements for the constituent entities in the Group. There are
jurisdictions in which the Group operates where the transitional safe harbour relief does not apply, and the
Pillar Two effective tax rate is close to 15%. The Group does not expect a material exposure to Pillar Two
income taxes in those jurisdictions.

The Group has also applied the temporary exception in [AS12 for the period.
Definition of Accounting Estimates (Amendments to IAS 8)

The company has adopted the amendments to IAS 8 for the first time in the current year. The amendments
replace the definition of a change in accounting estimates with a definition of accounting estimates. Under the
new definition, accounting estimates are “monetary amounts in financial statements that are subject to
measurement uncertainty”. The definition of a change in accounting estimates was deleted. There is no impact
on the accounting estimation reporting of the entity.

Disclosure of Accounting policies (Amendments to IAS I and IFRS Practice Statement 2)

The IASB issued amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2 Making Materiality Judgements,
providing guidance to help entities meet the accounting policy disclosure requirements. The amendments aim
to make accounting policy disclosures more informative by replacing the requirement to disclose ‘significant
accounting policies’ with ‘material accounting policy information’. The amendments also provide guidance
under what circumstance, the accounting policy information is likely to be considered material and therefore
requiring disclosure.

The company has adopted the amendments to IAS | for the first time in the current year.
New standards and interpretations effective on or after 1 January 2024

Standards issued but not yet effective up to the date of issuance of the Group’s financial statements are listed

Summary of material accounting policies (continued)
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty

In the application of the Group’s accounting policies described above, the directors are required to make
judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily
apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and
other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates. There are no key
sources of estimation uncertainty specific to the Company. .

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates
are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the
period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

Key sources of estimation uncertainty

The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet
date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
within the next financial year, are discussed below. .

Quality Incentive Contract revenue recognition

A portion of the Group’s revenue for London bus services is variable based on the performance of the Group’s
bus services against certain criteria, such as punctuality, reliability and other factors determined by Transport
for London. The Group is required to estimate the amount of this variable Quality Incentive Contract revenue
based on the performance of its London bus services against these criteria.

Impairment of goodwill

Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units
to which goodwill has been allocated. The value in use calculation requires the entity to estimate the future cash
flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate and long-term growth rates in

* order to calculate present value. Details of the carrying amount of goodwill and of the value in use calculations

are set out in note 9.
Measurement of provision for accident claims

The estimation of the self-insurance provision is based on an assessment of the expected settlement on known
claims together with an estimate of settlements for incidents which have occurred but not been reported before
the reporting date. The Group makes assumptions concerning these judgemental matters based on its Claims
team’s past experience of similar incidents as well as the advice of its lawyers and insurers. Details of the
provision for accident claims are given in note 17.

Measurement of post-employment benefit liabilities

The present value of the defined benefit pension schemes’ liabilities is dependent on a number of assumptions
including interest rates of high quality corporate bonds, inflation and mortality rates. The net interest expense
or income is dependent on the interest rates of high quality corporate bonds. The assumptions are based on the

* conditions at the time and changes in these assumptions can lead to significant movements in the estimated

obligations. Further details of the techniques applied, inputs used and the sensitivity to changes of the net pension
liabilities are given in note 22 to the financial statements.

25%. The change in rates has made a material impact on the carrying value of the Group’s Deferred Tax
Liabilities as set out above. Temporary differences expected to reverse after 1 April 2023 have been recalculated
with reference to the increased rate of 25%.

, £'000 £'000

Cost and net book value

At | January . 49,280 49,280

At 31 December 49,280 49,280

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated at acquisition to the Group that are expected to benefit
from that business combination. The cost of goodwill in these financial statements, which arose prior to IFRS
adoption, has been measured at its amortised book value under previous UK GAAP at the date of transition to
IFRS. The carrying amount of goodwill of £49,280,000 (2022: £49,280,000) is allocated to the bus business in
the UK. :

The Group is required to test, on an annual basis, whether goodwill has suffered any impairment. The
recoverable amounts of the cash generating units (“CGUs”) are determined based on value in use calculations.
The use of this method requires the estimation of future cash flows and the determination of a discount rate in
order to calculate the present value of the cash flows.

The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and
expected changes to revenues and direct costs during the period.

Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time
value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs. The estimated discount rate used was 7.81% (2022: 9.95%).
Changes in revenues and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.

The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management

for the next year and extrapolates cash flows into perpetuity, recognising the long-term characteristics of
passenger transport cash-generating units, market forecasts and relevant inflation metrics.

Credit risk management

Apart from TEL, the largest customer of the Group, the Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure
to any single counterparty or any group of counterparties having similar characteristics. The Group regards the
credit risk arising from TfL to be limited as it is a UK government body. TfL accounts for 85% (2022: 96%) of
trade receivables and contract assets and the Group regards the credit risk arising from TEL to be limited as it is
a UK government body. The credit risk on liquid funds and hedging instruments is limited because the
counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.

No allowance has been made for estimated irrecoverable amounts which has been determined by reference to
past default experience. The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, which is
net of impairment losses, represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk as no collateral or other credit
enhancements are held. The total value of receivables which are past due but not impaired is insignificant.

The insurance provision relates to liabilities where there is uncertainty about the timing of settlement, but where
areliable estimate can be made of the amount. The group self-insures its fleet of buses against claims in respect
of traffic accidents, subject to an overall annual limit to its liability.

The directors have recognised as a liability in the accounts the undiscounted financial impact of the expected
resolution of any outstanding claims on the basis of all information currently available, on a consistent basis.
The directors do not consider the impact of discounting to be material.

Due to the uncertain nature of insurance claims, any provision made may be excessive of insufficient to cover
the final settled value. However, analysis in the year suggests that the total of finalised settled claims is broadly
similar to the total value of claims submitted, and therefore for 2023 the value has not been discounted. The
majority of claims are likely to be settled within five years although in a small number of cases it may take
significantly longer for the final amount of liability to be established.

Financial instruments (continued)

A description of the Group’s financial instrument risks, including risk management objectives and policies is
given below.

Financial risk management policies and objectives

The Group recognises that management of financial risk is an important aspect in its drive towards creating
shareholder value. Management oversees financial risk management and regularly reviews its policy governing
risk management practices. The Group’s management monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the
operations of the Group and seeks to minimise the effects of these risks by using hedging instruments to hedge
these risk exposures. It is the Group’s policy not to participate in speculative financial instruments.

There has been no change to the Group’s exposure to these financial risks or the manner in which it manages
and measures these risks.

Capital risk management policies and objectives

The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns

: while maximising the return to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The

Group’s overall strategy remains unchanged from prior years.

The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt (borrowings disclosed in notes 14, 15 and 16 after
deducting cash and bank balances) and equity of the Group (comprising issued capital, reserves and retained
earnings). The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.

No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the years ended 31 December 2023 and
2022.

Market risk

The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates
and interest rates (see below). The Group enters into a variety of hedging instruments to manage its exposure to
interest rate and foreign currency risk, including:

° Forward contracts to hedge the price risk arising on highly probable future purchases of fuel;

e forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on highly probable future
purchases of fuel; and

¢ interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates.

Fuel hedges
MT 2,135 4,631 (360) (36)
, 2135 4,631 (360) (6)

The Group's hedging instruments were measured at fair value and were all classified as Level 2 in the IFRS 13
fair value hierarchy, i.e. they were derived from inputs other than unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for,
identical assets or liabilities, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).

The fair value of fuel hedges at the reporting date was determined by a discounted cash flow valuation estimating
cash flows based on forward fuel prices (from observable fuel prices at the end of the reporting period) and
contract forward rates, discounted at a rate that reflects the credit risk of various counterparties.

Fuel price risk

Fuel is part of the operating cost of the Group. The Group seeks to hedge the price risk associated with its fuel
needs and uses hedging instruments, where necessary, to achieve the desired hedge outcome.

Foreign currency risk

The Group manages its foreign exchange exposure primarily by matching revenue and costs in the relevant
currencies to create a natural hedge. However, the Group undertakes fuel purchase transactions linked to
commodities denominated in US dollars; consequently exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise. Exchange
rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward foreign exchange contracts.

The Group has total sterling denominated cash assets of £7,630,000 (2022: £17,687,000).

Financial assets of £19,000 (2022: £20,000) were denominated in US Dollars, the rest were denominated in
Pounds Sterling. :

Financial liabilities were denominated in Pounds Sterling.

Financial instruments (continued)
Interest rate risk management
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk where entities in the Group borrow funds at floating interest rates.

The Group’s primary interest rate risk relates to its borrowings. The Group uses hedging instruments such as
interest rate swaps and caps, where necessary, to achieve the desired interest rate profile in its effort to manage
interest rate risk. The Group sometimes borrows at variable rates and uses interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges
of future interest payments which have the economic effect of converting borrowings from floating rates to fixed
rates.

The Group's Loans from ComfortDelGro Corporation Limited in 2023 (included in Amounts owed to group
undertakings in Trade and other payables) were at variable rates averaging 4.51%. The loans are repayable on
demand. Lease liabilities were charged at a weighted average interest rate of 5.20% (2022: 1.24%).

Interest rate sensitivity analysis

The sensitivity analyses have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for hedging instruments at
the balance sheet date. For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability
outstanding at balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.

Based on sensitivity analysis performed at the end of the reporting period, management has assessed that the
exposure to changes in interest rates is minimal and hence the resulting impact on the profit or other
comprehensive income of the Group is insignificant.

Liquidity risk management

Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the board of directors, which has established an
appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Group’s short, medium and long-
term funding and liquidity management requirements. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining
adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and
actual cash flows, and by matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.

Retirement benefit obligations
A. Defined contribution scheme

The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme. The charge for the scheme in 2023 is £5,621,000
(2022: £5,369,000). The contributions outstanding at the year end amounted to £nil (2022: £nil).

B. Defined benefit schemes
Metroline and Metroline London Northern Pension Schemes

The Group operates two UK registered trust based pension schemes, the Metroline Pension Scheme and the
Metroline London Northern Pension Scheme, that provide defined benefits. Pension benefits are linked to the
members’ final pensionable salaries and service at their retirement (or date of leaving if earlier). The Trustees are
responsible for running the Schemes in accordance with the Schemes’ Trust Deed and Rules, which sets out their
powers, The Trustees of the Schemes are required to act in the best interests of the beneficiaries of the Schemes.
There is a requirement that at least one-third of the Trustees are nominated by the members of the Schemes

There are two categories of pension scheme members:
* Deferred members: those who have not retired and are not in receipt of a pension
+ Pensioner members: in receipt of pension.

The defined benefit obligation is valued by projecting the best estimate of future benefit outgo (allowing for
revaluation to retirement for deferred members and annual pension increases for all members) and then discounting
to the balance sheet date. The majority of benefits receive increases linked to inflation (subject to a cap of no more
than 5% pa). The valuation method used is known as the Projected Unit Method. The approximate overall duration
of the Schemes’ defined benefit obligation as at 31 December 2023 was around 12 years.

Both schemes are now closed to new entrants. On 28 February 2007 the schemes were closed to future accrual
(with the exception of those members whose retirement date was no later than 3] January 2008). This means that
their benefit entitlements no longer increase in line with their length of service and salary.

Future funding obligation

The Trustees are required to carry out an actuarial valuation every three years.

The last actuarial valuation of the Metroline Pension Scheme was performed by the Scheme Actuary for the
Trustees as at 31 March 2022. This valuation revealed a funding shortfall of £2.9 million. In respect of the deficit
in this Scheme as at 31 March 2022, the Company has agreed to pay contributions as follows:

Risks
Through the Schemes, the Company is exposed to a number of risks:

* Asset volatility: The Schemes’ defined benefit obligation is calculated using a discount rate set with reference
to corporate bond yields, however the Schemes have some investment in equities. These assets are expected
to outperform corporate bonds in the long term, but provide volatility and risk in the short term.

* Changes in bond yields: a decrease in corporate bond yields would increase the Schemes’ defined benefit
obligation, however this would be partially offset by an increase in the value of the Schemes’ bond holdings.

¢ Inflation risk: a significant proportion of the Schemes’ defined benefit obligation is linked to inflation;
therefore, higher inflation will result in a higher defined benefit obligation (subject to the appropriate caps in
place). The majority of the Schemes’ assets are either unaffected by inflation, or only loosely correlated with
inflation, therefore an increase in inflation would also increase the deficit. .

* Life expectancy: if Scheme members live longer than expected, the Schemes’ benefits will need to be paid for
longer, increasing the Schemes’ defined benefit obligation.

The Trustees and Company manage risks in the Schemes through the following strategies:

* Diversification: investments are well diversified, such that the failure of any single investment would not have
a material impact on the overall level of assets.

* Investment strategy: The Trustees are required to review their investment strategy on a regular basis.
Assumptions

The results of the most recent formal actuarial valuations as at 31 March 2023 and 5 April 2023 have been updated
to 31 December 2023 by a qualified independent actuary. The assumptions used are in note 22 (i) stated below.

Virgin Media Case

A recent court ruling in the United Kingdom has cast potential doubt on the validity of changes made to contracted-
out defined benefit pension schemes in the period 1997 to 2016 referred to as Section 37 changes. Metroline Travel
Limited and Metroline West Limited have contracted-out defined benefit pension schemes to which Section 37
changes were made in the period 1997 to 2016, therefore this court ruling is applicable. On 25 July 2024, the Court
of Appeal dismissed an appeal to this and confirmed in relation to alterations made between 6 April 1997 and 5
April 2013, section 9(2B) rights included both past service rights and future service rights. Management are in the *
process of obtaining and reviewing the documentation to support the Section 37 changes in this period, therefore,
it is not yet possible to conclude on whether the Section 37 changes were valid or estimate the potential impact on
the valuation of the company's defined benefit pension liabilities.
