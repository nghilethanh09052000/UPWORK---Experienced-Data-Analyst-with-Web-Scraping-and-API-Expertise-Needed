TRUSTEES’ REPORT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2024

Chair's foreword

2023/24 has been a positive year for Independent Training Services (ITS) with a number of new contracts and
projects and the ongoing development of a first-rate staff team. During the year the Board of Trustees
monitored closely the execution of the operational plan and our progress delivering another year of profitability.
The organisation remains focused on improving our financial health and providing the best education and
training experience for our learners (students) and local businesses.

Mrs C Cooper-Smith, Chair, Board of Trustees

Managing Directors Introduction

The financial year 2023/24 was a better trading year due to increases in revenue and growth of new projects
taking place for ITS. Apprenticeship recruitment was the highest it has been for very many years and with small
to medium size enterprises now engaging in apprenticeships again across service industries supported by
sustained recruitment in the care sector. ITS also started delivering South Yorkshire Mayoral Combined
Authority (SYMCA) courses for jobs funding direct and successfully gained growth on adult loan contracts.

Smartstyle Technology Training Limited also generated a positive contribution for the first year in four years
due to expanding their services available into longer courses as opposed to short workshops. This area of the
business is well positioned to continue to move forward for future years and capitalise on an increasing offer
available to individuals and employers.

ITS were successful in winning additional contracts in 2023/24 that will start in 2024/25. The main contract
that ITS has secured is the delivery of Adults Skills Funding through SYMCA. This contract will start on the 1
August 2024,

The quality of provision has been good overall across all contracts. Apprenticeships and courses for adults
were inspected and graded Good in June 2023 and this is still the case in 2023/24. The achievement rate for
apprentices has increased for the third successive year and retention and achievement in adult programmes
have been sustained whilst doubling the cohort size. Partnership provision has been outstanding all year
delivering high levels of quality teaching and learning whilst delivering excellent outcomes for learners
transforming lives.

Our people remain passionate and committed to our core purpose and have demonstrated a positive
and welcoming team approach to ensure we are stronger and have greater resilience to continue our journey.

Managing Director

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2024

The Trustees present their annual report together with the audited financial statements of Independent
Training Services Limited (the company / ITS) for the parent company and group for the period 1 August 2023
to 31 July 2024. The Trustees confirm that the Annual Report and financial statements of the company
comply with the current statutory requirements, the requirements of the company's governing document and
the provisions of the Statement of Recommended Practice (SORP), applicable to charities preparing their
accounts in accordance with the Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland (FRS

Memorandum of Association on 22 August 2001. The company and the group is constituted under a
Memorandum of Association, registered charity number 1091711 and company (limited by guarantee)
number 4274770.

The Board of Trustees changed in 2018/19 following the acquisition by Barnsley College. The trustees monitor
the organisation’s performance through a formal board which meets four times a year. The Board monitors
the financiat and operational performance and risk management of ITS and Smartstyle, and invitations are
made to other senior leadership team members as appropriate. As required by the Articles of Association, an
Annual General Meeting is held on a yearly basis.

The governance model changed in 2019/20 to bring it into line with the College. There is a formal procedure
for the induction and training of trustees that mirrors that of Barnsley College.

Trustees

The Trustees are appointed by the Board of Trustees. The trust deed allows for a minimum of five Trustees and
no more than twelve. One third (or the number nearest one third) of the Trustees must retire each year, those
longest in office retiring first. A retiring Trustee who remains qualified may be reappointed.

Meetings
The Board of Trustees meet every quarter. At the meetings, the Trustees agree the broad strategy and areas
of activity of the company, including ratification of grants thot are made and a review of the live risk register.

Policies and Procedures adopted for Recruitment, Induction and Training of Trustees

The Board keeps the skill requirements for the Trustee Body under review. Any recruitment of new Trustees is
undertaken by open advertisement and through a dialogue with interested parties. When an individual
expresses an interest in becoming a Trustee, an initial meeting is held with the Chair. A proposal to appoint a
new Trustee is submitted to the Board for approval. Once an appointment has been made, the newly elected
Trustee undergoes an induction programme. The company keeps up to date with key developments and
training is provided to Trustees as and when required.

Financial Plan and Budget

The company adopts the Callege’s business planning and performance review cycle. Business plans are
completed annually and reviewed by the senior leadership team at the college. Performance reviews are
completed quarterly and review ail aspects of the business performance. The detailed business plan and
accompanying budget are submitted for approval by the Board of Trustees on an annual basis. The day-to-day
running of the company is delegated to the Managing Director, who has the power to act and take decisions,
as long as they are contained within the plan. Any deviations from or additions to the plan have to receive
approval from the Board of Trustees. The Managing Director submits a written report detailing progress and
future planned activity to all Board meetings. The Company continues to produce an annual Self-Assessment
Report (SAR) which is validated by the College and approved by the ITS Board of Trustees.

Apprenticeships recruitment is continuing to grow on a regional and national basis with new apprenticeships

INDEPENDENT TRAINING SERVICES LIMITED

TRUSTEES’ REPORT (continued)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2024

Going Concern
The group balance sheet shows net assets of £242,257 (2023 £239,723) and the surplus for the year before
actuarial gains was £35,534 (2023: surplus of £144,588).

The going concern assessment considered the company financial operating forecasts and cash flow forecasts
to December 2025. The company hos sufficient cash funds throughout this period. The cash flow is sensitive to
delays in cash receipts and therefore contains some risk that it will not have sufficient cash to cover its debt.
Barnsley College, the parent company is comfortable based on forecasts that it has the ability to support its
subsidiary entities and has confirmed they will financially support the company for at least twelve months
following from the date the financial statements are signed, including support for ITS’s subsidiary SmartStyle
Technology Training Limited which is in a net liabilities position at 31 July 2024. As such, the Trustees are of
the view that, based on detailed budgets and cash flow forecasts, the group will be able to pay its debts as
they fail due and therefore the group is a going concern.

Exemptions from disclosure

Since the company and the group qualify as small under section 383, the strategic report required of medium
and large companies under The Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Director's Report) Regulations 2013
is not required.

No separate Statement of Financial Activities has been presented for the company alone as permitted by
section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.

Funds held as custodian trustee on behalf of others
The company does not hold any funds as a custodian trustee on behalf of others.

Developments

ITS have evidenced positive recruitment trends across the apprenticeship market which has resulted in the
highest participation in over five years. The main priority is to maintain this by increasing and diversifying our
curriculum offer with an ever increasing geographical reach for 2024/25. Continuous review and robust planning
of the offer in line with labour market intelligence and in collaboration with employers allows us to maintain this
positive trend.

We will also be pushing hard to gain future growth in the adult market and build on the success of recent
contracts we have won. Focus on gaining new direct contracts for local and regional provision will also be high
on the key priorities for 2024/25.

TRUSTEES’ REPORT (continued)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2024

Risk Management and Principal Risks
The risk management system includes an assessment of the greatest risks to the company against financial,
operational and student impact which is designed to protect the company’s assets and reputation.

A comprehensive review of the risks to which the company is exposed is undertaken and acknowledged in the
Board Assurance Framework (BAF). The Board Assurance Framework identifies the key risks, the likelihood of
those risks occurring, their potential impact on the group and the actions being taken to reduce and mitigate
the risks and covers assurance gained. Systems and procedures are identified which mitigate potential impact
on the company. In addition to the annual review, we will also consider any risks which may arise as a result
of a new area of work being undertaken by the group.

Our historic Local Government Pension Scheme administrated by South Yorkshire Pensions Authority (SYPA)
shows an actuarial position of nil. The actuary review resulted in asset position, we have under the FRS 102
accounting rules, shown this as a nil position within our balance sheet as the pension fund terms would not
allow for the asset to be realised. We have agreed an annual contribution fee for current scheme members,
which is shown in the SOFA. We work closely with SYPA and TC Group Limited our tax advisors, to ascertain an
annual actuarial statement, to ensure we conform and comply with the FRS and HMRC treatment of multi-
employer pensions’ scheme. .

UK Government's agency ESFA continue with their radical reform to apprenticeships, which has been planned
since a review in 2012, and has resulted in a new register of training providers. The three changes included;
new standards which impacts on the current delivery model; an employer levy system which impacts on the
funding model; and a new procurement systern which impacts the current annual contract.

REPORT OF THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS TO THE MEMBERS OF INDEPENDENT. TRAINING
SERVICES LIMITED

Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Independent Training Services Limited (the
‘parent charitable company’) and its subsidiary (the ‘group’) for the year ended 31 July 2024
which comprise the Consolidated Statement of Financial Activities, the Consolidated
Statement of Financial Position, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement and notes to the
financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. The financial
reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United
Kingdom Accounting Standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 102 The Financial
Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland (United Kingdom Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice).

In our opinion the financial statements:

- give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and parent charitable company's affairs
as at 31 July 2024 and of the group’s incoming resources and application of resources,
including its income and expenditure, for the year then ended;

- have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice; and ,

- have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK))
and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are
independent of the group and parent charitable company in accordance with the ethical
requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the
FRC's Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with
these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Conctusions relating to going concern
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the trustees’ use of the going
concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties
relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on
the group and parent charitable company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period
of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the trustees with respect to going concern are
described in the relevant sections of this report.

Other information :

The trustees are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the
information in the trustees’ report, but does not include the financial statements and our Report
of the Auditors thereon.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the
extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance
conclusion thereon.

INDEPENDENT TRAINING SERVICES LIMITED

REPORT OF THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS TO THE MEMBERS OF INDEPENDENT TRAINING
SERVICES LIMITED (CONTINUED)

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent
with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to
be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material
misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement
in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude
that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that
fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.

Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

- the information given in the trustees’ report, which includes the directors’ report,
prepared for the purposes of company law, for the financial year for which the financial
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and

- the directors’ report, included within the trustees’ report, has been prepared in
accordance with applicable legal requirements.

Matters on which we are required to report by exception

In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and parent charitable company
and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified material
misstatements in the trustees’ report.

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006
requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:

- adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent charitable company, or
returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches nat visited by us; or

- the parent charitable company’s financial statements are not in agreement with the
accounting records and returns; or

- certain disclosures of trustees’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or

- we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or

- the trustees were not entitled to prepare the financial statements in accordance with the
small companies regime and take advantage of the small companies’ exemption from the
requirement to prepare a Strategic Report.

Responsibitities of trustees

As explained more fully in the Statement of Trustees’ Responsibilities, the trustees (who are also
the directors of the parent charitable company for the purposes of company law) are responsible
for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and
fair view, and for such internal contro! as the trustees determine is necessary to enable the
preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to
fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the trustees are responsible for assessing the group and
parent charitable company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable,
matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the
trustees either intend to liquidate the group or parent charitable company or to cease
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

INDEPENDENT TRAINING SERVICES LIMITED

REPORT OF THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS TO THE MEMBERS OF INDEPENDENT TRAINING
SERVICES LIMITED (CONTINUED)

Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a
whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue a Report
of the Auditors that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance,
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect
© material misstatement when it exists. Misstaternents can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We
design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material
misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures
are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below:

- We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable
to the group and parent charitable company and determined that the most significant
frameworks which are directly relevant so specific assertions in the financial statements
are those that relate to the reporting framework (UK GAAP, the Companies Act 2006, the
Charities Act 2011 and Charities SORP) and the relevant tax compliance regulations in the
UK.

- We understood how the group and parent charitable company is complying with those
frameworks by making enquiries of management and those responsible for legal and
compliance procedures. We corroborated our enquiries through review of board minutes
and discussions with those charged with governance.

- We assess the susceptibility of the group and parent charitable company's financial
statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur, by discussion with
management from various parts of the business to understand where they considered
there was a susceptibility to fraud. We considered the procedures and controls that the
group and parent charitable company has established to prevent and detect fraud, and
how these are monitored by management, and also any enhanced risk factors such as
performance targets.

- Based on our understanding, we designed our audit procedures to identify any non-
compliance with laws and regulations identified in the paragraphs above.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located
on the Financial Reporting Council's website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This
description forms part of our Report of the Auditors.

Use of our report

This report is made solely to the company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3
of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might
state to the charitable company's members those matters we are required to state to them in
a Report of the Auditors and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do
not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the charitable company and the
charitable company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions
we have formed.

statements of the company and its subsidiary undertaking. The results of the subsidiary areconsolidated on a
line by line basis.

No separate SOFA has been presented for the company alone as permitted by section 408 of the Companies
Act 2006.

1.2 Company status

The company is a company limited by guarantee. The members of the company are the Trustees named on
page 1. In the event of the company being wound up, the liability in respect of the guaranteeis limited to £1 per
member of the company.

Technology Training Limited has a net liabilities position at 31 July 2024 including a debt owing to ITS of £205,098.

subsidiary entities and has confirmed they will not seek repayment of the debt for at least twelve months
following from the date the financial statements are signed. As such, the Trustees are of the view that, based on
detailed budgets and cash flow forecasts, the group will be able to pay its debts as they fall due and therefore the
group is a going concern.

1.4 Income

All income is recognised once the company has entitlement to the income, it is probable that the income
will be received, and the amount of income receivable can be measured reliably. Government funded grants
and amounts from the Growth Company are accounted for under the accruals model as permitted by FRS 102.
Funding body recurrent grants are measured in line with best estimates for the period of what is receivable
and dependent on the particular income stream involved. Income from other trading activities is recognised
upon the raising of sales invoices or upon receipt of cash from eligible government schemes.

Where income is received for a specific purpose which is defined the income and associated expenditure is
shown within restricted funds.

1.5 Expenditure

Expenditure is recognised once there is a legal or constructive obligation to transfer economic benefitto a third
party, it is probable that a transfer of economic benefits will be required in settlement and the amount of the
obligation can be measured reliably. Expenditure is classified by activity. The costsof each activity are made up
of the total of direct costs and shared costs, including support costs involved in undertaking each activity.
Direct costs attributable to a single activity are allocated directlyto that activity. Shared costs which contribute
to more than one activity and support costs which are not attributable to a single activity are apportioned
between those activities on a basis consistent withthe use of resources. Central staff costs are allocated on the
basis of time spent, and depreciation charges allocated on the portion of the asset’s use.

Support costs are those costs incurred directly in support of expenditure on the objects of the company and
include project management carried out at Headquarters. Governance costs are thoseincurred in connection
with administration of the company and compliance with constitutional and statutory requirements.
Charitable activities and Governance costs are costs incurred on the company’s educational operations,
including support costs and costs relating to the governance of the company apportionedto charitable
activities. .

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

1.7 Tangible fixed assets and depreciation
All assets costing more than £1,000 are capitalised.

A review for impairment of a fixed asset is carried out if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying value of any fixed asset may not be recoverable. Shortfalls between the carrying value of fixed assets
ond their recoverable amounts are recognised as impairments. Impairment losses are recognised in the
Statement of financial activities.

Tangible fixed assets are carried at cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment. Depreciation is
provided at rates calculated to write off the cost of fixed assets, less their estimated residual value, over their
expected useful lives on the following bases:

Fixtures and fittings - 20% - 25% Straight line
Computer equipment - 33.3% Straight line

1.8 Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are valued at cost less provision for impairment.
1.9 Interest receivable

Interest on funds held on deposit is included when receivable and the amount can be measured reliably by
the company; this is normally upon notification of the interest paid or payable by the Bank.

1.10 Debtors

Trade and other debtors are recognised at the settlement amount after any trade discount offered.
Prepayments are valued at the amount prepaid net of any trade discounts due.

1.11 Cash at bank and in hand ‘

Cash at bank and in hand includes cash and short term highly liquid investments with a short maturity of three
months or less from the date of acquisition or opening of the deposit or similar account.

1.12 Liabilities and provisions

Liabilities are recognised when there is an obligation at the Balance sheet date as a result of a past event, it is
probable that a transfer of economic benefit will be required in settlement, and the amountof the settlement
can be estimated reliably. Liabilities are recognised at the amount that the companyanticipates it will pay to
settle the debt or the amount it has received as advanced payments for the goods or services it must provide.
Provisions are measured at the best estimate of the amounts required to settle the obligation. Where the
effect of the time value of money is material, the provisionis based on the present value of those amounts,
discounted at the pre-tax discount rate that reflects the risks specific to the liability. The unwinding of the
discount is recognised within interest payable and similar charges.

1.13 Financial instruments
The company only has financial assets and financial liabilities of a kind that qualify as basic financial
instruments. Basic financial instruments are initially recognised at transaction value and subsequently measured at
their settlement value with the exception of bank loans which are subsequently measured at amortised cost
using the effective interest method.

1.14 Deferred taxation

Full provision is made for deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from all timing differences between the
recognition of gains and losses in the financial statements and recognition in the tax computation.

Anet deferred tax asset is recognised only if it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be
suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated at the tax rates expected to be effective at the time the
timing differences are expected to reverse.
1.15 Pensions

The company operates a defined contribution pension scheme, and the pension charge represents the
amounts payable by the company to the fund in respect of the year.

The company operates a defined benefit pension scheme, and the pension charge is based on a full actuarial
valuation dated 31 March 2023, updated to 31 July 2024 by the actuary. More detail of the scheme can be
found in Note 19.

1.16 Fund accounting

General funds are unrestricted funds which are available for use at the discretion of the Trustees in
furtherance of the general objectives of the company and which have not been designated for other purposes.

Designated funds comprise unrestricted funds that have been set aside by the Trustees for particular purposes.
The aim and use of each designated fund is set out in the notes to the financial statements.

which have been raised by the company for particutar purposes. The costs of raising and administering such
funds are charged against the specific fund.

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
1.17 Critical accounting estimates

The preparation of financial statements may require management to make significant judgements and
estimates. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and
other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances. There are no critical areas of judgements.

Critical accounting estimates:

The company and group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting
estimates and assumptions will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and
assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.

Local Government Pension Scheme

The present value of the Local Government Pension Scheme defined benefit liability depends on a number of
factors that are determined on an actuarial basis using a variety of assumptions. The assumptions used in
determining the net cost (income) for pensions including the discount rate which is the most sensitive to the
macro-economic environment. Any changes in these assumptions, which are disclosed in note 19, will impact
the carrying amount of thepension liability. Furthermore, a roll forward approach which projects results from
the latest full actuarial valuation performed at 31 March 2023 has been used by the actuary in valuing the
pensions liability at 31 July 2024. Any differences between the figures derived from the roll forward approach
and a full actuarial valuation would impact on the carrying amount of the pension liability.

19 PENSION COMMITMENTS (continued)
Guaranteed Minimum Pension

Defined benefit pension schemes will be affected by the ultimate resolution of the equalisation of benefits for
men and women in relation to Guaranteed Minimum Pension (GMP) provisions. The 2018 Lloyds Bank court
judgement provided clarity in this area. A further High Court ruling in 2020 extended GMP equalisation costs to
historic transfers, potentially creating a further liability for pension schemes. The LGPS has allowed for the
impact of full GMP indexation in the calculation of the latest funding valuation results in respect of the 2018
ruling. The actuaries believe the 2020 ruting is unlikely to have a significant impact, so they have not made any
allowance for this in their calculations.

Transitional Protection Arrangements (McCloud)

Following the toss of a court case (the McCloud judgement) which found that transitional protections put in
place when two public sector pension schemes were reformed were age discriminatory, the government
committed in July 2019 to seeking a remedy across all public sector schemes. The key feature of the proposed
remedy was to extend the final salary scheme underpin to a wider group of members for service up to 31
March 2022. The College’s pension liabilities in respect of the South Yorkshire Pension Fund have increased
due to this. The fund actuary has included an allowance that is substantially in line with the judgement and
the effect of any minor proposed changes will have an estimated liability of nil. The schemes actuaries have
rolled forward the previous allowance and no additional adjustment has been made for the current year.

Widower Benefits (Goodwin)

Following a recent Employment Tribunal ruling that a female member in an opposite sex marriage is treated
less favourably than a female in a same sex marriage or civil partnership, and that treatment amounts to
direct discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, the government announced in July 2020 that it
believed changes would be required to all public sector schemes with similar arrangements. For the College,
this will increase the liability in respect of the South Yorkshire Pension Fund, but no allowance has been made
in the accounting figures as it is expected that the impact on the liabilities will be immaterial (circa 0.1-0.2%
of the obligations) and there is currently insufficient data available to estimate a cost
