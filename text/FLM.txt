NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2024

STATUTORY INFORMATION

FLM Training Ltd is a private company, limited by shares, registered in England and Wales. The company's registered
number is 08384009 and the registered office address is Atlas House, Caxton Close, Wheatlea Industrial Estate, Wigan, WN3
6XU.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of preparing the financial statements

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102 "The Financial
Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland” including the provisions of Section 1A “Small Entities"
and the Companies Act 2006. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.

Significant judgements and estimates
In the application of the company's accounting policies, the directors are required to make estimates and judgements. The
estimates are based on historical experience and other relevant factors. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

The estimates are continually evaluated. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate
is revised.

The estimates and assumptions which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets
and liabilities are outlined below.

Estimating the useful economic life of an asset and the anticipated residual value are considered the key judgement in
calculating an appropriate depreciation charge.

Revenue
Revenue comprises the aggregate of the fair value of services supplied, net of rebates and discounts.

Sales of services are recognised when those services are provided to clients and the receipt of payment is reasonably assured.

Property, plant and equipment
Depreciation is provided at the following annual rates in order to write off each asset over its estimated useful life.
Plant and machinery etc - 25% on reducing balance, 20% on cost and 15% on reducing balance

The residual values, estimated useful lives and depreciation method of property, plant and equipment are reviewed, and
adjusted as appropriate, at each statement of financial position date. The effects of any revision are recognised in the income
statement when the change arises.

Financial instruments

The company only enters into basic financial instruments transactions that result in the recognition of financial assets and
liabilities like trade and other accounts receivable and payable, loans from banks and other third parties and loans to related
parties.

Financial assets that are measured at cost and amortised cost are assessed at the end of each reporting period for objective
evidence of impairment. If objective evidence of impairment is found, an impairment loss is recognised in the income
statement.

Basic financial liabilities are initially measured at transaction price and subsequently measured at amortised cost, being the
transaction price less any amounts settled.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued

Taxation

Taxation for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Income Statement, except to the extent that
it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.

Current or deferred taxation assets and liabilities are not discounted.

Current tax is recognised at the amount of tax payable using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the statement of financial position date.

Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the statement of
financial position date.

Timing differences arise from the inclusion of income and expenses in tax assessments in periods different from those in
which they are recognised in financial statements. Deferred tax is measured using tax rates and laws that have been enacted

or substantively enacted by the year end and that are expected to apply to the reversal of the timing difference.

Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that they will be
recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.

Pension costs and other post-retirement benefits

The company operates a defined contribution pension scheme. Contributions payable to the company's pension scheme are
charged to the income statement in the period to which they relate.

EMPLOYEES AND DIRECTORS

The average number of employees during the year was 13 (2023 - 13).
