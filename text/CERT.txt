The company continues to support Social Enterprises in the Humber area with business
support to start, grow and improve their impact as well as access social finance. This is
reduced in 2023-24 due to delays in SPF funding. It has continued to support social enterprise
sector development in Lincolnshire, in Gainsborough through GLAP and recently work has
started in Boston, East Lindsey and South Holland due SPF funding. This year we have
supported 43 enterprises across the region and delivered executive coaching support to
CEOs and managers within the third sector organisations as they continue to grow or fire fight
in these challenging times.

The company continues to deliver highly effective apprenticeship provison to charities, social
enterprises, SMEs and Levy employers. The offer comprises of apprenticeship training for
roles: Fundraiser, Business Administrator, Marketing Assistant, Customer Service Practitioner
and Customer Service Specialist. For the reporting year the pass rates were 100%, First
Time Pass rate 100% and 22% of apprentices passing with Merit or Distinction. 83% of
apprentices continue to work for their employer, obtain a promotion or new job.
