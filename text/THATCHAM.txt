Directors’ Report

The Directors present their report and financial statements for year ended 31 December 2023.

Directors’ responsibilities statement
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Directors’ Report, the Strategic Report and the financial
statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.

Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law
they have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards and
applicable law (UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice), including FRS 102, The Financial Reporting
Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland.

Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that
they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group and of the profit or loss
of the Group for that year.

In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are required to:

e select suitable accounting policies for the Company and the Group’s financial statements and then
apply them consistently.

e make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent.

e prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume
that the Company and Group will continue in business.

The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and
explain the Company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position
of the Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the
Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to
them to safeguard the assets of the Company and the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other
irregularities.

Directors’ Report (continued)

Proposed dividend
As a company limited by guarantee, the Company does not make distributions out of the accumulated fund.

Disclosure of information to auditor

The Directors who held office at the date of approval of the Directors’ report confirm that, so far as they are
each aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company and the Group's auditor is
unaware, and each Director has taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as a director to make
themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company and the Group's
auditor is aware of that information.

Going concern

The Group has cash resources and has no further requirement for external funding in excess of current
facilities. The Directors have a high expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in
operational existence for the foreseeable future. In making their assessment, the Directors have
considered the Group’s ability to continue to service its members and customers. They continue to believe
that the going concern basis of accounting is appropriate in preparing the annual financial statements.

Auditor
Pursuant to section 487 of the Companies Act 2006, the Auditor will be deemed to be reappointed and
Crowe U.K. LLP will therefore continue in office.

This report was approved by the Board and signed on its behalf

Strategic Report
The Directors present their Strategic Report for year ended 31 December 2023.

Business review, principal activities and future developments
Thatcham Research was established in 1969 by British Insurers. The Company is independently operated
with a Board of Directors drawn from amongst the 30 insurer members who fund its work.

Thatcham Research carries out research targeted at influencing the design of vehicles to reduce accidents
and to improve safety, security and repairability, thereby driving down claim’s costs for its insurer members.
As a company limited by guarantee it does not make distributions out of the accumulated fund.

As well as being levy funded by the members, the Group has commercial revenues from a range of products
and services focussed on the Repair, Automotive and Insurance sectors, as well as from its site at Gamston.
Key customers are repair body shops, vehicles manufacturers and data providers and such revenues assist
in the delivery of value to members.

Thatcham Research's data and expertise is also sought by overseas markets that see the benefit of the
Company's activities and the value it brings by providing practical tools to effectively manage accident
repair, vehicle theft and personal injury claims.

On 23 December 2021 the Company purchased Gamston Aviation Limited, a company which owns the
freehold of an airfield and connected buildings in Nottinghamshire. During 2022 the new Group developed
the airfield site such that it is now used for both Automotive research and testing and aviation activities.

In February 2024, the Company signed a contract with LexisNexis Risk Solutions, which should provide a
significant uplift to data/risk rating revenues over the coming years.

Thatcham Research's future development will be influenced by a number of factors, predominately the
members requirements for solutions to issues which affect the successful running of their business
especially with the challenges of the current economic climate and the increasing need for adherence to
government and international policy, corporate governance, corporate social responsibility and the
demands of their customers - the motorist.

Principal risks and uncertainties

Due to the current world economic conditions and the consequential poor performance from equities and
ongoing impact of quantitative easing, the largest financial risk to the business continues to be the defined
benefit pension scheme deficit of £6.5M (2022: £6.0M) based on the valuation as at 31 December 2023.
This position should be balanced with the current commercial opportunities available to the Group.

Financial risk management

The Group’s operations expose it to a variety of financial risks that include credit risk, liquidity risk, interest
rate risk and foreign currency risk. It has specific policies and procedures to manage those risks that are
set by the Board and implemented by the Finance Department.

¢ Credit risk: The Group has policies to ensure that credit checks are undertaken on all new
customers.

e Liquidity risk: The Company is cash generative and has access to overdraft and loan facilities with
its Bank.

e Interest rate risk: The Company has cash deposits that are subject to variable interest rates. It is
therefore exposed to changes in market interest rates.

e Foreign currency risk: The Company makes sales and purchases in foreign currencies and has
bank accounts denominated in foreign currencies. As such it is exposed to foreign exchange risk.

Strategic Report (continued)

Measurement .

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are used to help manage the business and ensure that it remains
focused on the achievement of objectives that are linked to the overall Group’s long-term plan. The main
financial KPls used are:

« Surplus for the year. The Group aims to create a surplus for the year sufficient to fund the payments
into the defined benefit pension scheme as agreed with the Trustee of the scheme.

*e Cash. The Group aims to manage cash to allow it to operate with little or no overdraft facility.

e Commercial revenues. Such revenues supplement levy income, allowing the Company to provide
more value to members.

During the year turnover increased from £24.9M to £25.9M. Member levy payments comprise 59% of
turnover (2022: 56%).

The deficit before tax for the year is £0.2M (2022 surplus: £0.85M). The Company is not for profit
distribution, with any surplus either being invested in the business to conduct in research on behalf of the
members or used to fund payments into the defined benefit pension scheme. During 2023 the Company
made payments of £0.7M (2022: £Nil) into that scheme, which was closed for further accruals in 2007.
The Consolidated balance sheet is in a net asset position of £2.83M (2022: £3.45M), the reduction largely
due to the increased defined benefit pension deficit at 31 December 2023.

Independent Auditor’s Report to the Members of Thatcham Researcn

Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of Thatcham Research (the “parent company”) and its subsidiaries (the
“group”) for the year ended 31 December 2023 which comprise the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income,
the Consolidated and Company Balance Sheets, the Consolidated and Company Statement of Changes in Equity, the
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows and the related notes to the financial statements, including significant
accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and
United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 102 The Financial Reporting Standard
applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

In our opinion, the financial statements:
e give a true and fair view of the state of the group's and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December
2023 and of the group's deficit for the year then ended;
« have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice;
«have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

Basis for opinion .

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law.
Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the
financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the group in accordance with the ethica! requirements.
that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard, and we have
fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we
have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Conclusions relating to going concern
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concem basis of accounting
in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions
that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group's ability to continue as a going concern for a
period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concem are described in the relevant
sections of this report.

Other information

The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annua! report. The other information
comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor's report
thereon: Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent
otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially
inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially
misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine
whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we
have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report
that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.

Independent Auditor’s Report to the Members of Thatcham Research (Continued)

Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion based on the work undertaken in the course of our audit
e the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which the
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
e the strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal ©
requirements.

Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the parent company and their environment obtained
in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report.

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us
to report to you if, in our opinion:
e adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit
have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

Responsibilities of directors

As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 4, the directors are responsible for
the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such
internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group's and the parent company’s
ability to continue as a going concem, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concem and using the going
concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with
ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.

Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line
with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud.
The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below:

We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks within which the group and company operates,
focusing on those laws and regulations that have a direct effect on the determination of material amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. The laws and regulations we considered in this context were the Companies
Act 2006, Financial Reporting Standard 102 and Tax legislation. We assessed the required compliance with these
laws and regulations as part of our audit procedures on the related financial statement items.

In addition, we considered provisions of other laws and regulations that do not have a direct effect on the financial
statements but compliance with which might be fundamental to the group and company’s ability to operate or to avoid
a material penalty. We also considered the opportunities and incentives that may exist within the company for fraud.
The laws and regulations we considered in this context for the company were General Data Protection Regulation
({GDPR) and Health & Safety regulations.

Auditing standards limit the required audit procedures to identify non-compliance with these laws and regulations to
enquiry of the Directors and other management and inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence, if any.

Independent Auditor’s Report to the Members of Thatcham Research (Continued)

We identified the greatest risk of material impact on the financial statements from irregularities, including fraud, to be
within the recognition of certain income streams and the override of controls by management. Our audit procedures to
respond to these risks included enquiries of management about their own identification and assessment of the risks of
irregularities, sample testing on the posting of journals, reviewing accounting estimates for biases and reading minutes
of meetings of those charged with governance.

Owing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk that we may not have detected some material
misstatements in the financial statements, even though we have properly planned and performed our audit in
accordance with auditing standards. For example, the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations
(irregularities) is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely the inherently
limited procedures required by auditing standards would identify it. In addition, as with any audit, there remained a
higher risk of non-detection of irregularities, as these may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,
misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls. We are not responsible for preventing non-compliance and
cannot be expected to detect non-compliance with all laws and regulations.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is available on the Financial
Reporting Council's website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors
report. .

Use of our report

This report is made solely to the company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company's members those
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted
by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company's members as
a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Notes to the Financial Statements
1 Company Information

The Company's name is Thatcham Research with registered number 00967763. It is incorporated in
England and its registered address is Colthrop Way, Thatcham, Berkshire, RG19 4NR. The Company is
limited by guarantee and is not for profit distribution. It carries out research targeted at influencing the
design of vehicles to reduce accidents and to improve safety, security and repairability, thereby driving
down claims costs for its insurer members.

2 Accounting policies

The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered
material in relation to the financial statements.

2.1 Basis of preparation of financial statements

The consolidated and company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial
Reporting Standard 102, the Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland
("FRS 102”) and the Companies Act 2006. The preparation of financial statements in compliance with
FRS102 requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise
judgement in applying the Group’s accounting policies (see note 3).

The Company has taken the exemption allowed under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and has not
presented its own statement of comprehensive income in these financial statements.

The presentation currency of these statements is sterling. The financial statements are prepared on the
historical cost basis, modified to include the revaluation of certain land and buildings. The following principal
accounting policies have been applied.

2.2 Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and all of its non-
dormant subsidiary undertakings made up for the year ended 31 December 2023. Intra-group transactions
have been eliminated on consolidation. Any subsidiary undertakings acquired in the year are included from
the date of change of control.

2.3 Going concern :

The Group has cash resources and has no further requirement for external funding in excess of current
facilities. The Directors have a high expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in
operational existence for the foreseeable future. In making their assessment, the Directors have considered
the Group’s ability to continue to service its members and customers. They continue to believe that the
going concern basis of accounting is appropriate in preparing the annual financial statements.

2.4 Valuation of investments .
Investments in subsidiaries are measured at cost less accumulated impairment. A review for indicators of
impairment is carried out at each reporting date, with the recoverable amount being estimated where such
indicators exist.

2.5 Revenue recognition and deferred income

Revenue is stated net of value added tax. Revenue for the annual levy, subscriptions and rent/hangarage is
recognised equally over the period to which the invoice relates. The unexpired portion of the annual levy /
subscription is held within deferred income on the balance sheet.

Revenue from consultancy, training, grant funded research and testing activities as well as aviation services

is recognised as the services are performed and/or courses delivered. Revenue from software licences is
recognised on delivery.

Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)
2 Accounting policies (continued)

2.6 Government grants

Capital based government grants are included within accruals and deferred income and credited to the
profit and loss account over the estimated useful economic lives of the assets to which they relate. Other
grants are credited to the income and expenditure account as the related expenditure is incurred.

2.7 Operating leases

Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the period
of the lease. The aggregate benefit of lease incentives is recognised as a reduction to the expense
recognised over the lease term on a straight-line basis.

2.8 Research and development (R&D) expenditure
Expenditure on R&D is written off to the profit and loss account in the year it is incurred.

2.9 Pensions

The Group operates a defined contribution plan for its employees. A defined contribution plan is a pension
plan under which the Group pays a fixed contribution into a separate entity. Once the contributions have
been paid the Group has no further payment obligations. The contributions are recognised as an expense
in the profit and loss account when they fall due. Amounts not paid are shown in accruals as a liability in
the Balance Sheet. The assets of the plan are held separately from the Group in independently
administered funds.

The Company also has a legacy defined benefit pension scheme which closed to new members in 2004
and to accrual in 2007. The defined benefit pension liability is recognised in the balance sheet based on
the fair value of the benefit obligation less the fair value of the plan assets. The defined benefit obligation
is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. Actuarial gains and
losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised through
the statement of other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.

2.10 Foreign currencies

Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the
transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the
contracted rate or the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and the gains or losses on
translation are included in the profit and loss account

2.11 Current and deferred taxation

The charge for taxation is based on the surplus for the year and takes into account taxation deferred
because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the treatment
of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance
sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS 102 Section 29 Income Tax. The tax rate applied is that
expected to apply to the reversal of the timing difference using tax rates and laws that have been enacted
or substantially enacted at the time the accounts are drawn up.

2.12 Intangible Fixed Assets
Amortisation is provided to write off the cost less the estimated residual value of intangible fixed assets by
equal instalments over their estimated useful economic lives as follows:

e IT software development — 5 years

The IT development relates to a bespoke development known as Plaza which holds all of the information
the Company generates about a car make/model.

2 Accounting policies (continued)

2.13 Tangible Fixed Assets
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost or valuation less the estimated residual value of tangible fixed
assets by equal instalments over their estimated useful economic lives as follows:

Land and buildings - freehold - 0 to 50 years

Land and buildings - adaptation works — 5 to 20 years

Land and buildings - leasehold improvements - 5 to 15 years

Plant and equipment - 5 to 15 years

Fixtures and fittings (including computer equipment and motor vehicles) - 3 to 10 years

The freehold land and buildings at the Gamston site are carried at the fair value or deemed cost at the date
of acquisition less depreciation. The freehold !and and buildings at the Thatcham site are revalued every
2 years for the purposes of assessing the value of the contingent asset for the Thatcham Defined Benefit
pension scheme. This valuation is then also used in the financial statements of the Group and Company.

2.14 Trade / other debtors and trade creditors

Trade and other debtors are recognised at transaction cost, less any appropriate provision for estimated
irrecoverable amounts. A provision is established for irrecoverable amounts when there is objective
evidence that amounts due under the original payment terms will not be collected. Trade creditors are
recognised at transaction cost.

2.15 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash at bank and in hand and highly liquid interest-bearing securities
with maturities of three months or less.

2.16 Financial instruments
The Group only enters into basic financial instruments transactions that result in the recognition of financial
assets and liabilities like trade and other debtors and creditors, loans from banks and other third parties.

3 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty

Preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgements and estimates. The
Directors consider the following as material judgements in applying accounting policies or key sources of
estimation uncertainty:

3.1 Impairment of tangible and intangible fixed assets

The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the fixed asset may not be recoverable. If any such
indication exists, the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. An impairment loss is recognised whenever
the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the
profit and joss account unless it arises on a previously revalued fixed asset. An impairment loss on a
revalued fixed asset is recognised in the profit and loss account if it is caused by a clear consumption of
economic benefits. Otherwise, impairments are recognised in the statement of Other Comprehensive
Income until the carrying amount reaches the asset's depreciated historic cost.

3 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty (continued)

3.2 Valuation of the defined benefit pension n scheme

A key source of estimation uncertainty relates to the valuation of the defined benefit pension. Determining
the value of future defined benefit obligations requires the use of certain assumptions including inflation
rates, pension increases and mortality rates, among others. These assumptions are applied on the advice
of an independent actuary. Following the Lloyds case ruling at the High Court in October 2018, UK defined
benefit pension schemes need to take steps to equalise benefits for males and females to deal with
differences in Guaranteed Minimum Pension (GMP) between sexes. The Company has estimated the
additional liability in respect of GMP equalisation to be 1% of scheme liabilities.
