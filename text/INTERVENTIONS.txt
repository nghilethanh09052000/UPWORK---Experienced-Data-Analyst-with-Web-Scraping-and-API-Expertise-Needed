General Information

The company is a private company limited by shares, registered in England and Wales. The
address of the registered office is 125 Main Street, Garforth, Leeds, LS25 1AF.

Statement of Compliance

These financial statements have been prepared in compliance with Section 1A of FRS 102,
‘The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and the Republic of Ireland’.

Accounting Policies
Basis of Preparation

The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, as modified by the
revaluation of certain financial assets and liabilities and investment properties measured at fair
value through profit or loss.

The financial statements are prepared in sterling, which is the functional currency of the entity.
Revenue Recognition

Turnover comprises the value of goods and services supplied by the company during the
period, net of Value Added Tax, trade discounts, and is credited based on the amount which is
proportionate to the relevant period under the terms of UITF40.

Income Tax

The taxation expense represents the aggregate amount of current and deferred tax recognised
in the reporting period. Tax is recognised in profit or loss, except to the extent that it relates to
items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, tax is
recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.

Current tax is recognised on taxable profit for the current and past periods. Current tax is
measured at the amounts of tax expected to pay or recover using the tax rates and laws that
have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences at the reporting date.
Unrelieved tax losses and other. deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is
probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other
future taxable profits. Deferred tax is measured using the tax rates and laws that have been
enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date that are expected to apply-to the reversal
of the timing difference. :

Accounting Policies (continued)
Tangible Assets

Tangible assets are initially recorded at cost, and subsequently stated at cost less any
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Any tangible assets carried at revalued
amounts are recorded at the fair value at the date of revaluation less any subsequent

. accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses.

An increase in the carrying amount of an asset as a result of a revaluation, is recognised in
other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity, except to the extent it reverses a
revaluation decrease of the same asset previously recognised in profit or loss. A decrease in
the carrying amount of an asset as a result of revaluation, is recognised in other comprehensive
income to the extent of any previously recognised revaluation increase accumulated in equity
in respect of that asset. Where a revaluation decrease exceeds the accumulated revaluation
gains accumulated in equity in respect of that asset, the excess shall be recognised in profit or
loss.

Depreciation’

Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost or valuation of an asset, less its residual
value, over the useful economic life of that asset as follows:

Learning management - 25% reducing balance
system .
Office equipment . - 25% reducing balance

Impairment of Fixed Assets

A review for indicators of impairment is carried out at each reporting date, with the recoverable
amount being estimated where such indicators exist. Where the carrying value exceeds the
recoverable amount, the asset is impaired accordingly. Prior impairments are also reviewed
for possible reversal at each reporting date. ,

For the purposes of impairment testing, when it is not possible to estimate the recoverable
amount of an individual asset, an estimate is made of the recoverable amount of the cash-
generating unit to which the asset belongs. The cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable
group of assets that includes the asset and generates cash inflows that largely independent of
the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.

For impairment testing of goodwill, the goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from
the acquisition date, allocated to each of the cash-generating units that are expected to benefit
from the synergies of the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the
company are assigned to those units.

Stocks

Stocks are measured at the lower of cost and estimated selling price less costs to complete and
sell. Cost includes all costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs incurred in
bringing the stock to its present location and condition.

Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the entity has an obligation at the reporting date as a result of
a past event, it is probable that the entity will be required to transfer economic benefits in
settlement and the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably. Provisions are
recognised as a liability in the statement of financial position and the amount of the provision
as an expense.

Provisions are initially measured at the best estimate of the amount, required to settle the
obligation at the reporting date and subsequently reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted
to reflect the current best estimate of the amount that would be required to settle the obligation.
Any adjustments to the amounts previously recognised are recognised in profit or loss unless
the provision was originally recognised as part of the cost of an asset. When a provision is
measured at the present value of the amount expected to be required to settle the obligation,
the unwinding of the discount is recognised as a finance cost in profit or loss in the period it
arises.

Financial Instruments

Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the
contractual arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a

‘ residual interest in the assets of the entity after deducting all of its financial liabilities.

Where the contractual obligations of financial instruments (including share capital) are
equivalent to a similar debt instrument, those financial instruments are classed as financial
liabilities. Financial liabilities are presented as such in the balance sheet. Finance costs and
gains or losses relating to financial liabilities are included in the profit and loss account.
Finance costs are calculated so as to produce a constant rate of return on the outstanding
liability.

Where the contractual terms of share capital do not have any terms meeting the definition of a
financial liability then this is classed as an equity instrument. Dividends and distributions
relating to equity instruments are debited direct to equity.

Defined Contribution Plans

Contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as an expense in the period in which
the related service is provided. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent
that the prepayment will lead to a reduction in future payments or a cash refund.

When contributions are not expected to be settled wholly within 12 months of the end of the
reporting date in which the employees render the related service, the liability is measured on
a discounted present value basis. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as a finance cost
in profit or loss in the period in which it arises.
