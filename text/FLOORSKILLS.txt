NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2024

1. STATUTORY INFORMATION

Floorskills Limited is a private company, limited by shares , registered in England and Wales. The company's
registered number and registered office address can be found on the Company Information page.

The presentation currency of the financial statements is the Pound Sterling (£).

2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of preparing the financial statements

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102 "The
Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland" including the provisions of Section 1A
"Small Entities" and the Companies Act 2006. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical
cost convention.

Turnover
Turnover is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, excluding discounts, rebates,
value added tax and other sales taxes.

Tangible fixed assets
Depreciation is provided at the following annual rates in order to write off each asset over its estimated useful life.

Improvements to property - 10% on cost

Fixtures and fittings - 25% on cost

Motor vehicles - 25% on reducing balance
Computer equipment - 33.33% on cost
Taxation

Taxation for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Income Statement, except to
the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.

Current or deferred taxation assets and liabilities are not discounted.

Current tax is recognised at the amount of tax payable using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.

Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance
sheet date.

Timing differences arise from the inclusion of income and expenses in tax assessments in periods different from
those in which they are recognised in financial statements. Deferred tax is measured using tax rates and laws that
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the year end and that are expected to apply to the reversal of the
timing difference.

Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that they
will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.

Pension costs and other post-retirement benefits
The company operates a defined contribution pension scheme. Contributions payable to the company's pension
scheme are charged to profit or loss in the period to which they relate.
