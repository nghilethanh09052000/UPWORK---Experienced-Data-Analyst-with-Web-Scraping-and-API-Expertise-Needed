Strategic report

The directors present their Strategic report, Directors’ report and financial statements for the year ended 31
December 2023

Principal activities
The principal activity of the Company is that of foundation engineers.
Business model

Roger Bullivant Limited is a piling and foundation engineering company specialising in the design and construction
of piles and foundations for all types of buildings and structures, for use in a wide variety of ground conditions.

The Company is part of the worldwide foundation group, Soletanche Bachy, itself one of the > largest and most
diverse foundation engineering companies in the world.

The Company places research & development at the forefront of its strategy, always focusing on the needs of our
customers. Foundation schemes will often use standard products and systems but will be individually engineered to
satisfy particular customer needs and always with an eye on value engineering.

The Company operates from a Head Office centrally positioned in the Midlands and from six regional offices
around the UK. This maximizes local knowledge and facilitates local customer care.

The Company views health, safety and training as priority areas to ensure that its employees are well equipped to
deal with the challenges that the Company's business sector presents. Increasing control and regulation related to
plant, site operations and the environment are regarded as positive factors throughout all levels of the Company’s
personnel.

Finance review
Turnover for the year has decreased by 10.5% from £97.4m to £87.2m with a resulting Operating Profit of £2.777m.
Business review

The Company sustained strong levels of activity throughout the year considering the economic downturn,
particularly in the Company’s key market sector, residential housing. The company also carried out works
successfully in non-residential sectors and views this as an important part of the company’s offering which remains
a key target area for future years.

At 31 December 2023, the company had net assets of £18.594m (2022: £14.997m) and Turnover was £87.2m (2022:
£97.4m). The directors proposed and paid a dividend in the year of £2.0m (2022: £1.5m).

The Company continues to invest in production equipment, plant and staffing resources and despite the ongoing
challenges of the economic environment is targeting an increase in turnover next year.

Key performance indicators
The Company views turnover and profitability as the main financial key performance indicators for the business.

Turnover has decreased in 2023 by 10.5% to £87.2m (2022. £97.4m) with an operating result of £2.7m in 2023
(2022: £7.49m). The decrease in operating result is mainly driven by the turnover decrease.

The business regularly monitors and reviews other key performance indicators in relation to health, safety,
environmental matters and human resources. Environmental KPI’s are included in the Directors Report.

Strategic report (continued)
Section 172(1) statement

The directors are well aware of their duty under s.172 of the Companies Act 2006 to act in the way which they
consider, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its
shareholders and other stakeholders; including the following key matters:

- Strategic decisions are made in close conjunction with Soletanche Bachy board members to ensure they
fully support the interests of shareholders, employees and clients

- Ensuring a high degree of integrity in dealings with employees, customers and suppliers. This is closely
monitored against internal procedures and is reflected in both the long service of a number of senior staff
and through long-standing relationships with clients

- Working closely with its employees through its employee engagement groups to ensure employee views
and opinions are considered in developing key strategies and decisions

- Through its corporate activities and using its employee engagement groups the company seeks to maximise
its contribution to its local communities and environment

- Akey objective of the company being to help consumers interact with brands across transport, retail and
hospitality through the provision of construction and engineering.

Employee engagement statement

The Company makes full use of its intranet, regular news flashes and in-house magazines, with contributions from
employees, to communicate matters of interest to as wide an audience as possible. The Company has an employee
forum where employee representatives meet and ask questions to Company’s management about a wide range of
issues which may affect them.

The company offers an employee share ownership scheme which allows employees to purchase shares in the
Company’s ultimate parent company Vinci SA. Under the terms of this scheme the Company will match the shares
purchased by the employee.

Engagement with other key stakeholders
Customers

The Company works closely and collaboratively with our customers to ensure the most cost effective and efficient
designs are produced to deliver our works in accordance with our customer’s needs. The Company has a number of
framework agreements with national contractors which assist in this collaborative approach and the delivery of repeat
business. We believe open communication at all stages of the works is vital to ensure our customers receive the end
result they are happy with. We carry out satisfaction surveys following completion of our works to understand the
areas that went well and review where improvements can be made.

Suppliers

The Company has a number of national framework contracts with key suppliers which provides visibility and
consistency for those suppliers as well as ensuring we have access to the key products and services we require. We
have regular meetings with our suppliers to ensure the expectations of both parties are being met and where they are
not action plans put in place to address any issues.

The Company operates out of regional offices and recognises the importance of working with local smaller suppliers
ensuring the local regions will benefit economically from our presence there.

Strategic report (continued)

Community

The Company operates out of 6 regional offices which provide employment opportunities within those regions. We
have a well-established apprenticeship programme providing an excellent training programme. The Company and
employees will provide support and donations to local charities including through the Group charity, Vinci
Foundation. The Company is a valued supporter of the National Forest where for every metre of precast pile we
produce we donate money to them so they can plant more trees.

Principal risks and uncertainties

The UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement which was signed on 30 December 2021 (following the agreed Brexit
transition period) sets out preferential arrangements in areas such as trade in goods and in services, digital trade,
intellectual property, public procurement, aviation and road transport, energy, fisheries, social security coordination,
law enforcement and judicial cooperation in criminal matters, thematic cooperation and participation in Union
programmes. It was applied provisionally as of 1 January 2022 and entered into force on 1 May 2022. It is
underpinned by provisions ensuring a level playing field and respect for fundamental rights.

The Company has been continually reviewing the potential impacts resulting from the Brexit agreement and the
longer-term risks that may consequently arise. To date, the Company has seen a tightening of the labour market and
increased delivery periods for some items of European sourced plant and equipment, but these have not materially
impacted on the business.

Another challenge is ensuring the availability of plant and skilled labour resource to carry out the anticipated
workload levels safely and profitably. Competition in the market is an inherent risk and the Company is always
looking to provide the best technological solution at the best value for the client.

Another main risk is the non-payment of client debts, and the Company regularly monitors the financial health of its
clients to ensure bad debts are not a significant issue to the Company.

Future developments

The Company will continue to ensure that it’s strategy places safety practices and behaviour at the forefront of all
we do.

The Company continues to look at ways to increase its profitability through increased market share, access to new
markets, improved site productivity and long-term relationships with key clients and partners. With the deteriorating
economic conditions and increased interest rates the Company expects activity to decrease in 2024. However
through continued emphasis on site efficiency and cost control throughout the business, the Board are confident of a
good performance in 2024.

For the year ended 31 December 2023

Directors’ report

The following sections have been included in the Strategic Report and form part of the directors’ report by cross
reference:

Future developments

Principal risks and uncertainties

The Directors present their annual report with the audited financial statements of the company for the year ended 31
December 2023. The directors have paid a dividend in the year £2,000,000 (2022: £1.5m).

Directors

The directors who held office during the year were as follows:

G Trafford

P Hines (Resigned 21 September 2023)

C Wren (Resigned 31 March 2023)

D Clement

M Pedley (Appointed 13 September 2023)

Post balance sheet events

There are no post balance sheet events that require disclosure.

Going concern

The Company is now reporting a positive net current asset position and have reviewed the current performance and
prepared cash flow forecasts for the next 12 months which shows sufficient cash balances to fund the business. The
realisation of these forecasts may be affected by a number of factors, including changes in customer behaviour,
however, the directors are confident that the Company has adequate resources to continue its operations for the
foreseeable future.

The Directors have also reviewed the impact of the ongoing Ukraine conflict and the impact this has had on cost
inflation to the business. The company where possible is reflecting the increased costs within future tenders along
with seeking protection through contractual terms to mitigate any impact.

For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concem basis in preparing the financial statements. The financial
statements do not include any adjustments that would result from the basis of preparation being inappropriate.

Financial risk management disclosures

The company’s operations expose it to a variety of financial risks that include the effects of changes in credit risk,
liquidity risk and cash flow risk. The company has in place a risk management programme that seeks to limit the
adverse effects on the financial performance of the company. The Company does not trade in financial instruments,
nor does it enter into any derivative transactions.

Credit risk

Credit checks are carried out where appropriate for new and existing customers and for suppliers to whom payments
on account are made.

Liquidity risk
The company manages liquidity risk by maintaining sufficient cash balances and use of the group’s cash pooling
facility. The company operates a system of monthly cash forecasting, which is monitored weekly.

Registered number 07681731

For the year ended 31 December 2023

Directors’ report (continued)

Cash flow risk

The cash flow of the company is exposed to non-payment risk by customers. The company manages this risk by
carefully appraising the credit quality of customers prior to entering into contracts, establishing reasonable credit
terms, actively managing cash collections.

Third party indemnity

The company maintained throughout the year, and at the date of approval of the financial statements, third party
liability insurance for its directors and officers. This is a qualifying provision for the purposes of the Companies Act
2006.

Employees

It is the Company's policy to give full and fair consideration to the employment of disabled people wherever possible,
in as much as their abilities allow. Efforts are and will continue to be made to retain employees who become disabled
whilst in service, and to afford them whatever training they may need to take on new challenges in the Company.

Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reporting

The Board recognise the importance of environmental issues and is reviewing ways to reduce its carbon footprint.
Recent initiatives have included:

¢ PV Installation to Hornbeam Building (manufacturing facility) - Installed a second and third phase of solar
PVs to our Hornbeam roof with a fourth phase to be installed on our office roof in 2024. In total these three
phases of PV provides c.310kWp. During 2023 this has generated 232,434 kWh of electricity. Which has
reduced our uptake of grid electricity when using electricity to power the factory.

e Fleet Cars and Vans — RBL continues to use a Driver Rewards System (Lightfoot) in all our commercial
vehicles to improve fuel efficiency and therefore carbon emissions. The company cars are restricted by carbon
emitted per mile/ km and an EV (Electric Vehicle) is available at all levels for company car drivers. Provision
for charging EV’s has been made by increasing our number of EV charging points at Head Office to 6 as well
as installing chargers at our area offices where allowed. The EV charging points are all powered by the PV’s
installed on site. ,

e Innovation:

o RBL has completed a review the use of HVO fuel in its site rigs, support vehicles and owned HGVs
and will be implementing its use across significant parts of the business in 2024.

© Focussing on behaviour and influencing individuals in relation to their impact on the environment at
home and at work. Currently evaluating the results of a companywide sustainability survey, resulting
in the creation of a new 15 person strong sustainability team to share ideas and to encourage the
implementation and ‘buy-in’ of the company Carbon Reduction Roadmap.

o Researching the use of ultra-high performance concrete to reduce our reliance on steel piles which
have higher cost and carbon emissions.

o Encouraging the use of very low carbon concrete on our cast in situ rigs.

Annual report and financial statements

For the year ended 31 December 2023

Statement of directors’ responsibilities in respect of the Strategic Report, Directors’
Report and the financial statements

The directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic Report, the Directors' Report and the financial statements in
accordance with applicable law and regulations.

Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law they have
elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with UK accounting standards and applicable law (UK
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice), including FRS 102 The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the
UK and Republic of Ireland.

Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a
true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of the profit or loss of the company for that period. In
preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:

¢ — select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
e make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;

state whether applicable UK accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures
disclosed and explained in the financial statements;

e assess the company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going
concern; and :

* use the going concer basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the company or to cease opcrations,
or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the
company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and
enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are responsible for
such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and have general responsibility for taking such steps as are
reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the company and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.

Independent auditor’s report to the members of
Roger Bullivant Limited

Report on the audit of the financial statements

Opinion

In our opinion the financial statements of Roger Bullivant Limited :

e give a true and fair view of the state of the company’s affairs as at 31/12/2023 and of its profit for the year then
ended;

e have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice,
including Financial Reporting Standard 102 “The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and
Republic of Ireland”; and

e have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

We have audited the financial statements which comprise:

¢ the statement of profit and loss

e the balance sheet;

e the statement of changes in equity;

e the related notes 1 to 18 (Which include a statement of accounting policies)

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom
Accounting Standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 102 “The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in
the UK and Republic of Ireland” (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable
law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the auditor's responsibilities for the audit of
the financial statements section of our report.

We are independent of the company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the
financial statements in the UK, including the Financial Reporting Council’s (the ‘FRC’s’) Ethical Standard, and we
have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Conclusions relating to going concern

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting
in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or
conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a going
concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant
sections of this report.

Other information :

The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and
our auditor’s report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise
explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially
inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears
to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are
required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If,
based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we
are required to report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.

’ Responsibilities of directors

As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as
the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the company’s ability to continue as
a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concem and using the going concern basis of
accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic
alternative but to do so.

Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with
ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and
are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website
at: www. frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.

Extent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in
line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including
fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below.

We considered the nature of the company’s industry and its control environment, and reviewed the company’s
documentation of their policies and procedures relating to fraud and compliance with laws and regulations. We also
enquired of management about their own identification and assessment of the risks of irregularities.

We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory framework that the company operates in, and identified the

key laws and regulations that:

e had adirect effect on the determination of material amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. These
included the UK Companies Act and tax legislation; and

e do not have a direct effect on the financial statements but compliance with which may be fundamental to the
company’s ability to operate or to avoid a material penalty.

We discussed among the audit engagement regarding the opportunities and incentives that may exist within the
organisation for fraud and how and where fraud might occur in the financial statements.

In common with all audits under ISAs (UK), we are also required to perform specific procedures to respond to the
risk of management override. In addressing the risk of fraud through management override of controls, we tested the
appropriateness of journal entries and other adjustments; assessed whether the judgements made in making accounting
estimates are indicative of a potential bias; and evaluated the business rationale of any significant transactions that are
unusual or outside the normal course of business.

In addition to the above, our procedures to respond to the risks identified included the following:

e reviewing financial statement disclosures by testing to supporting documentation to assess compliance with
provisions of relevant laws and regulations described as having a direct effect on the financial statements;

© performing analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships that may indicate risks of
material misstatement due to fraud;

e enquiring of management and external legal counsel concerning actual and potential litigation and claims, and
instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations; and

e reading minutes of meetings of those charged with governance.

11

Report on other legat and regulatory requirements

Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

e the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which the
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and

e the strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal
requirements.

In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the course of the
audit, we have not identified any material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report.

Matters on which we are required to report by exception

Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report in respect of the following matters if, in our opinion:
e adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from
branches not visited by us; or
the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.

Use of our report

This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted
by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as
a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

For the year ended 31 December 2023

Notes
Accounting policies
Roger Bullivant Limited (the “Company”) is a company limited by shares and incorporated, domiciled and registered

in England in the UK.

These financial statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102 The Financial
Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland (“FRS 102”) as issued in December 2017. The
presentation currency of these financial statements is sterling. All amounts in the financial statements have been
rounded to the nearest £1,000.

The Company’s ultimate parent undertaking, Vinci S.A., includes the Company in its consolidated financial
statements. The consolidated financial statements of Vinci S.A. are prepared in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and are available to the public and may be obtained from the
address given in note 19. In these financial statements, the Company is considered to be a qualifying entity (for the
purposes of this FRS) and has applied the exemptions available under FRS 102 in respect of the following disclosures:

¢ Reconciliation of the number of shares outstanding from the beginning to end of the period;
« Cash Flow Statement and related notes; and
e Key Management Personnel compensation.

As the consolidated financial statements of Vinci S.A. include the equivalent disclosures, the Company has also taken
the exemptions under FRS 102 available in respect of the following disclosures:

e Certain disclosures required by FRS 102.26 Share Based Payments; and,

e = The disclosures required by FRS 102.11 Basic Financial Instruments and FRS 102.12 Other Financial Instrument
Issues in respect of financial instruments not falling within the fair value accounting rules of Paragraph 36(4) of
Schedule 1.

The Company proposes to continue to adopt the reduced disclosure framework of FRS 102 in its next financial
statements.

Other than estimates made as part of the normal contracting business, there are no judgements made by the directors,
in the application of these accounting policies that have significant effect on the financial statements and estimates
with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year.

Ld Measurement convention

The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis.

1.2 Going Concern

The Company’s business model results in a positive working capital cycle which generates sufficient cash flows to
fund the business. The directors have reviewed the current performance and prepared cash flows forecasts for the next
12 months. The realisation of these forecasts may be affected by a number of factors, including changes in customer
behaviour, however, the directors are confident that the Company has adequate resources to continue its operations
for the foreseeable future.

For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. The financial
statements do not include any adjustments that would result from the basis of preparation being inappropriate.

1.3 Foreign currency

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the Company’s functional currency at the foreign exchange rate
ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance
sheet date are retranslated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Non-monetary
assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange
rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated
at fair value are retranslated to the functional currency at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was
determined. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the profit and loss account.

14 Basic financial instruments
Trade and other debtors / creditors

Trade and other debtors are recognised initially at transaction price less attributable transaction costs. Trade and other
creditors are recognised initially at transaction price plus attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial
recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses in the
case of trade debtors. If the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, for example if payment is deferred beyond
normal business terms, then it is measured at the present value of future payments discounted at a market rate of
instrument for a similar debt instrument.

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.

15 Tangible fixed assets

Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.

Where parts of an item of tangible fixed assets have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of
tangible fixed assets, for example land is treated separately from buildings.

Notes (continued)
1 Accounting policies (continued)
LS Tangible fixed assets (continued)
The Company assesses at each reporting date whether tangible fixed assets are impaired.

Depreciation is charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each
part of an item of tangible fixed assets. Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful
lives. Land and assets under construction are not depreciated. The estimated useful lives are as follows:

Plant and machinery - 2 to 10 years
Motor Vehicles -  2toS years
Fixtures and fittings - 2to5 years
Leasehold Improvements - 8 to 10 years

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed if there is an indication of a significant change
since the last annual reporting date in the pattern by which the Company expects to consume an asset’s future economic
benefits.

1.6 Revenue recognition - construction contracts

The majority of contracts carried out are considered short term and accordingly turnover has been calculated on the basis
of the value of work done during the year including the settlement of monetary claims on contracts completed in previous
years, net of VAT where appropriate.

1.7 Construction contract debtors

Construction contract debtors represent the gross unbilled amount for contract work performed to date. They are
measured at cost plus profit recognised to date (see the revenue accounting policy) less a provision for foreseeable
losses and less progress billings. Variations are included in contract revenue when they are reliably measurable and it
is probable that the customer will approve the variation itself and the revenue arising from the variation. Claims are
included in contract revenue only when they are reliably measurable and negotiations have reached an advanced stage
such that it is probable that the customer will accept the claim. Cost includes all expenditure related directly to specific
projects and an allocation of fixed and variable overheads incurred in the entity’s contract activities based on normal
operating capacity.

Construction contract debtors are presented as part of debtors in the balance sheet. If payments received from
customers exceed the income recognised, then the difference is presented as accruals and deferred income in the
balance sheet.

18 Stocks

Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell.
19 Impairment excluding stocks and deferred tax assets

Financial assets (including trade and other debtors)

A financial asset not carried at fair value through profit or loss is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether
there is objective evidence that it is impaired. A financial asset is impaired if objective evidence indicates that a loss
event has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset, and that the loss event had a negative effect on the estimated
future cash flows of that asset that can be estimated reliably.

L9 Impairment excluding stocks and deferred tax assets (continued)

An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between
its carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the asset’s original effective
interest rate. For financial instruments measured at cost less impairment an impairment is calculated as the difference
between its carrying amount and the best estimate of the amount that the Company would receive for the asset if it
were to be sold at the reporting date. Interest on the impaired asset continues to be recognised through the unwinding
of the discount. Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. When a subsequent event causes the amount of
impairment loss to decrease, the decrease in impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss.

1.10 Employee benefits
Defined contribution plans

A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which the Company pays fixed contributions
into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for
contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the profit and loss account in the
periods during which services are rendered by employees.

Lil Provisions

A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the entity has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result
of a past event, that can be reliably measured and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required
to settle the obligation. Provisions are recognised at the best estimate of the amount required to settle the obligation at
the reporting date.

1.12 Expenses
Operating lease

Payments (excluding costs for services and insurance) made under operating leases are recognised in the profit and
loss account on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease unless the payments to the lessor are structured to
increase in line with expected general inflation; in which case the payments related to the structured increases are
recognised as incurred. Lease incentives received are recognised in profit and loss over the term of the lease as an
integral part of the total lease expense.

1.13 Expenses (continued)
Interest receivable and Interest payable

Interest payable and similar charges include interest payable, finance charges on shares classified as liabilities and
finance leases recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method, unwinding of the discount on provisions,
and net foreign exchange losses that are recognised in the profit and loss account (see foreign currency accounting
policy).

Other interest receivable and similar income include interest receivable on funds invested and net foreign exchange
gains.

Interest income and interest payable are recognised in profit or loss as they accrue, using the effective interest method.
Dividend income is recognised in the profit and loss account on the date the entity’s right to receive payments is
established. Foreign currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis.

1.14 Government Grants

Government grants are recognised at the fair value of the asset received or receivable. Grants are not recognised until
there is reasonable assurance that the company will comply with the conditions attaching to them and the grants will
be received. Government grants are recognised using the accrual model Government grants are recognised using the
accrual model.

Under the accrual model, government grants relating to revenue are recognised on a systematic basis over the periods
in which the company recognises the related costs for which the grant is intended to compensate. Grants that are
receivable as compensation for expenses or losses already incurred or for the purpose of giving immediate financial
support to the entity with no future related costs are recognised in income in the period in which it becomes receivable.

1.15 Associates and Joint Ventures

The investments detailed in note 10 as joint arrangements have been accounted for with the appropriate share of
income, profits or losses, expenditure, assets and liabilities included in the profit and loss account and balance sheet.

1.16 Taxation

Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised. in the profit and loss
account except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income, in
which case it is recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income.

Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted
or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.

Deferred tax is provided on timing differences which arise from the inclusion of income and expenses in tax assessments
in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements. The following timing differences
are not provided for: differences between accumulated depreciation and tax allowances for the cost of a fixed asset if and
when all conditions for retaining the tax allowances have been met. Deferred tax is not recognised on permanent
differences arising because certain types of income or expense are non-taxable or are disallowable for tax or because
certain tax charges or allowances are greater or smaller than the corresponding income or expense.

Deferred tax is measured at the tax rate that is expected to apply to the reversal of the related difference, using tax rates
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax balances are not discounted.

Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that is it probable that they will
be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.

1.17 Dividends on shares presented within shareholders’ funds
Dividends are only recognised as a liability at that date to the extent that they are declared prior to the year end.
Unpaid dividends that do not meet these criteria are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.

1.18 ‘Related parties

As the Company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Vinci S.A., the Company has taken advantage of the exemption
contained in FRS 102.33.1A and has therefore not disclosed transactions or balances with wholly owned entities which
form part of that group.

Finance Act 2021, which was substantively enacted on 1] March 2021, maintained the corporation tax rate at 19% until 31

March 2023.

Finance Act 2022, which was substantively enacted on 24 May 2022, has enacted an increase in the UK corporation tax main rate

to 25% from | April 2023.

On 23 September 2022, the UK Government announced that the enacted 25% corporation tax rate applying from 1 April 2023
would be repealed and the corporation tax would remain at 19%. As this has not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet

date, its effects are not included in these financial statements

As this rate change had been substantively enacted before the balance sheet date, the closing deferred tax assets and liabilities
have been calculated at 25%, on the basis that this is the rate at which those assets and liabilities are expected to unwind.
