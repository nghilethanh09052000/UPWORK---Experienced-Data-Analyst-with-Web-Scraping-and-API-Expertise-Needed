STRATEGIC REPORT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2024

The directors present their strategic report for the year ended 31 July 2024.

Principal activity
The principal activity of the company is to promote and develop training courses in the creative industries.

Fair review of the business

Big Creative Training Ltd (BCT) was founded in 2000. Originally a record label and events promotion organisation
it is now a not-for-profit independent training provider specialising in the creative industries with a key focus on
inclusion and social mobility. Providing a broad creative education offer with excellent teaching, learning and
assessment, BCT is delivering a creative & digital offer with a clear line of site to work that promotes diversity,
inclusion and wellbeing.

Big Creative Training Ltd has one subsidiary undertaking, Big Creative Community CIC, which was created in
2018 to establish the unique co-work space ‘Creative Works’ that provides the base for all BCT adult leaming and
apprenticeship provision.

Big Creative Training was rated as ‘good with outstanding features’ by Ofsted in November 2023 and during the
year the company successfully funded and launched the Digital Future digital campus on a long term lease
creating space for 200 full time students.

Key Performance Indicators

The group's key financial during the year were as follows:

Financia! KPis Unit 2024 2023
Revenue £ 7,082,458 6,152,981
Gross assets £ 6,353,036 6,308,092
Surplus before tax £ 71,887 36,642

Principal risks and uncertainties
The group recognises the importance of managing financial and operational risks to ensure the stability and
sustainability of its operations. Key risks include the following;

(i) Interest rate risk management: The group regularly reviews its debt structure and interest rate exposure,
considering refinancing options to manage its interest rate risk.

(ti) Credit risk management: The group maintains strict credit control policies, including regular credit
assessments of customers and suppliers, to minimize the risk of bad debts and financial losses.

(iii) Fast growth: On-going major organisational growth puts too much pressure on staff, resources and quality.
(iv) Low financial health score: BCT ESFA financial health scores become in-adequate. The group review the
financial health scores regularly to ensure these remain at a satisfactory to good level.

BIG CREATIVE TRAINING LTD

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS' RESPONSIBILITIES

The directors acknowledge their responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in
accordance with applicable law and regulations.

Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the
directors have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company law
the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair
view of the state of affairs of the group and the company and of the surplus or deficit of the group for that period.
in preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:

+ select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently;
* make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;

* state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures
disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and

* prepare the financial statements on the going concem basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the
company will continue in business.

The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the
group's and the company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position
of the group and the company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the
Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the group and the company and
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF BIG CREATIVE TRAINING LTD

Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of Big Creative Training Ltd (the ‘parent company’) and its subsidiary
company (together the ‘group’) for the year ended 31 July 2024, which comprise the Consolidated Profit and Loss
Account, Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive income, Consolidated Balance Sheet, Statement of
Financial Position, Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, Statement of Changes in Equity, Consolidated
Statement of Cash Flows, and Notes to the Financial Statements, including a summary of significant accounting
policies. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United
Kingdom Accounting Standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 102 ‘The Financial Reporting Standard
applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland’ (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

In our opinion the financial statements:

* give a true and fair view of the state of the group's and the parent company’s affairs as at 31 July 2024 and of
the group's profit for the year then ended;

+ have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice;
and

im have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable

law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the auditor responsibilities for the audit of

the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the group in accordance with the ethical

requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical

Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We

believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Conclusions relating to going concern

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the director's use of the going concern basis of
accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or
conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group's ability to continue as a going
concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the original financial statements were authorised for
issue.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the
relevant sections of this report.

Other information

The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included
in the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. Our opinion on the
financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in
our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in
doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our
knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. if we identify such material
inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material
misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the
work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are
required to report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.

Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

Page 6

BIG CREATIVE TRAINING LTD

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF BIG CREATIVE TRAINING LTD (CONTINUED)

+ the Information given in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and

+ the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal
requirements.

Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of our knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the course of the
audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic Report and the Directors' Report.

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report
to you if, in our opinion:

+ adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit
have not been received from branches not visited by us; or

+ the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and retums; or
+ certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
* we have not received all the information and expfanations we require for our audit.

Responsibilities of directors

As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors' Responsibilities [set out on page 5], the directors are
responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair
view, and for such internal contro! as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the company's ability to continue
as a going concem, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis
of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or have no
realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditor Responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed betow:

Our approach to identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including
fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations, was as follows:

« the engagement partner ensured that the engagement team collectively had the appropriate competence,
capabilities and skills to identify or recognise non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations. We
discussed among the audit engagement team regarding the opportunities and incentives that may exist within
the organisation for fraud and how and where fraud might occur in the financial statements;

* we obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that the company operates in, and
identified the laws and regulations applicable to the company through discussions with directors and other
management, and from our cumulative audit and commercial knowledge and experience of the company and
the clothing industry;

* we focused on specific laws and regulations which we considered may have a direct material effect on the
financial statements or the operations of the company, including the Companies Act 2006, employment law,
taxation, The Education Act 1996, Education and Skills Act 2008, The Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and
Learning Act 2009 and health and safety legislation. We also considered and identified laws and regulations
that do not have a direct effect on the financial statements but compliance with which may be fundamental to
the company's ability to operate or to avoid a material penalty, including the Bribery Act, Data Protection Act
and Anti-Money Laundering regulations;

Page 7

BIG CREATIVE TRAINING LTD

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF BIG CREATIVE TRAINING LTD (CONTINUED)

* we assessed the extent of compliance with the laws and regulations identified above through making
enquiries of management and inspecting legal correspondence; and

+ identified laws and regulations were communicated within the audit team regularly and the team remained
alert to instances of non-compliance throughout the audit.

We assessed the susceptibility of the company’s financial statements to material misstatement, including
obtaining an understanding of how fraud might occur, by:

* making enquiries of management as to where they considered there was susceptibility to fraud, their
knowledge of actual, suspected and alleged fraud; and

* considering the internal controls in place to mitigate risks of fraud and non-compliance with laws and
regulations.

We are also required to perform specific procedures to respond to the risk of management bias and override of
contrals. To address this, we performed analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected
relationships; tested journal entries to identify unusual transactions.

In response to the risk of irregularities and non-compliance with laws and regulations, we designed procedures
which included, but were not limited to:

* agreeing financial statement to disclosures underlying supporting documentation;
* enquiring of management as to actual and potential litigation and claims; and

* reviewing correspondence with HMRC, Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA), Office for Standards in
Education, Children’s Services and Skills ( Ofsted) and Health and Safety Executive (HSE), analysing legal
costs to ascertain if there have been instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations.

There are inherent limitations in our audit procedures described above. The more removed that laws and
regulations are from financial transactions, the less likely it is that we would become aware of non-compliance.
Auditing standards also limit the audit procedures required to identify non-compliance with laws and regulations
to enquiry of the directors and other management and the inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence, if
any. Material misstatements that arise due to fraud can be harder to detect than those that arise from error as
they may involve deliberate concealment or collusion.

A further description of our responsibilities is available on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at:
www. frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor's report.

Use of our report

This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members
those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest
it permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the
ers as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Page 16


BIG CREATIVE TRAINING LTD

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2024 (CONTINUED)

2 Accounting policies (continued)

A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the company. Control is achieved where the company has the power to
govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.

The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Income statement from the
effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments
are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with those used by
the group.

The purchase method of accounting is used to account for business combinations that result in the acquisition of
subsidiaries by the group. The cost of a business combination is measured as the fair value of the assets given,
equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, plus costs directly
attributable to the business combination. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities
assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. Any excess
of the cost of the business combination over the acquirer's interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets,
liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised is recorded as goodwill.

Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between the company and its
subsidiaries, which are related parties, are eliminated in full.

intra-group losses are also eliminated but may indicate an impairment that requires recognition in the
consolidated financial statements.

Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies
adopted by the group. Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified
separately from the group's equity therein. Non-controlling interests consist of the amount of those interests at
the date of the original business combination and the non-controlling shareholder's share of changes in equity
since the date of the combination.

Going concern

The directors have considered the financial projections for the company over the foreseeable future. After making
enquiries, the directors are satisfied that the company has sufficient resources to continue in operation for the
foreseeable future, being at least 12 months from the date of signing the financial statements. Accordingly, they
continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.

Revenue recognition

Revenue comprises government grant receivable and other revenue receivable in the ordinary course of the
company’s activities. The company recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, it
is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity and specific criteria have been met. The
accounting policy for government grants are detailed below.

Research and development expenditure

Research expenditure is written off against profits in the year in which it is incurred. Identifiable development
expenditure is capitalised to the extent that the technical, commercial and financial feasibility can be
demonstrated.

Employee benefits
The costs of short-term employee benefits are recognised as a liability and an expense, unless those costs are
required to be recognised as part of the cost of stock or fixed assets.

The cost of any unused holiday entitlement is recognised in the period in which the employee's services are
received. Termination benefits are recognised immediately as an expense when the company is demonstrably
committed to terminate the employment of an employee or to provide termination benefits.

2 Accounting policies (continued)

Government grants
Government grant is recognised only when there is reasonable assurance that (a) the company will comply with
any conditions attached to the grant and (b) the grant will be received. Grants are not recognised in equity.

The grant is recognised as income over the period necessary to match them with the related costs, for which they
are intended to compensate, on a systematic basis. A grant receivable as compensation for expenses already
incurred is recognised as income when it becomes receivable. A grant related to assets is presented in the
statement of financial position either as deferred income or as a deduction from the carrying value of the related
asset.

Tax

The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in profit or loss, except that
a change attributable to an item of income or expense recognised as other comprehensive income is also
recognised directly in other comprehensive income.

The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of tax rates and laws that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the reporting date in the countries where the group operates and generates taxable
income.

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences between taxable profits and profits reported in the
consolidated financial statements.

Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised when it is probable that they will be
recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.

Deferred tax is measured using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the
reporting date and that are expected to apply to the reversal of the timing difference.

Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated in the statement of financial position at cost, less any subsequent
accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses.

The cost of property, plant and equipment includes directly attributable incremental costs incurred in their
acquisition and installation.

Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets over their estimated useful lives, as follows:
Asset class Depreciation method and rate

Over leasehold period of 50 years on a
straight line basis

Fixtures and fittings 33.3% per annum on cost
Computers 33.3% per annum on cost

Leasehold land and buildings

The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the sale proceeds
and the carrying value of the asset and is recognised in the profit and loss account.

The group reviews the amortisation period and method when events and circumstances indicate that the useful
life may have changed since the last reporting date.

Goodwill and other intangible assets are tested for impairment in accordance with Section 27 Impairment of
assets when there is an indication that goodwill or an intangible asset may be impaired.

2 Accounting policies (continued)

Investments

Non-current investments are stated at historical cost less provision for any diminution in value. Investments are
assessed for impairment at each reporting date and any impairment losses or reversals of impairment losses are
recognised immediately in surplus or deficit.

Impairment of fixed assets

Al each reporting period end date, the group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to
determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. ff any such
indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the
impairment loss (if any). Where it Is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the
group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.

The carrying amount of the investments accounted for using the equity method is tested for impairment as a
single asset. Any goodwill included in the carrying amount of the investment is not tested separately for
impairment.

Recoverabla amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. in assessing value in use, the
estimated future cash flows are discounted lo their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates
of future cash flows have not been adjusted.

if the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount,
the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment
loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which
case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.

Recognised impairment losses are reversed if, and only if, the reasons for the impairment loss have ceased to
apply. Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, The carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating
unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount
does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised
for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately
in profit or loss, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the
impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents are basic financial assets and include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks,
other short-term liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts. Bank
overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities.

Receivables

Receivables are recognised initially at the transaction price. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost
using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. A provision for the impairment of receivables is
established when there is objective evidence that the company will not be able to collect all amounts due
according to the original terms of the receivables.

2 Accounting policies (continued)

Payables

Payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business
from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if the group does not have an unconditional
right, at the end of the reporting period, to defer settlement of the creditor for at least twelve months after the
reporting date. If there is an unconditional right to defer settlement for at least twelve months after the reporting
date, they are presented as non-current liabilities.

Payables are recognised initially at the transaction price and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the
effective interest method.

Borrowings

Interest-bearing borrowings are initially recorded at fair value, net of transaction costs. interest-bearing
borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised cost, with the difference between the proceeds, net of
transaction costs, and the amount due on redemption being recognised as a charge to the income statement
over the period of the relevant borrowing.

Interest expense is recognised on the basis of the effective interest method and is included in interest payable
and similar charges.

Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of
the liabitity for at least twelve months after the reporting date.

Leases

Rentals payable under operating leases, including any lease incentives received, are charged to the income
statement on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease except where another more systematic basis
is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leases asset are consumed.

Share capital

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Equity instruments are measured at the fair value of the cash or other
resources received or receivable, net of the direct costs of issuing the equity instruments. If payment is deferred
and the time value of money Is material, the initial measurement is on a present value basis.

Defined contribution pension obligation

The group contributes into defined contribution pension schemes for the benefit of its employees. The assets of
the schemes are held separately from those of the group. Contributions are recognised in the income statement
in the period in which they become payable.

Financial instruments

Classification

The company only has financial assets and financial liabilities of a kind that qualify as basic financial instruments.
Basic financial instruments are initially recognised at transaction value and subsequently measured at their
settlement value.
