Accounting policies

Company information
Future Fit Training Limited is a private company limited by shares incorporated in England and Wales. The registered
office is Carnac Place, Cams Hall Estate, Fareham, Hampshire, United Kingdom, PO16 8UY.

Accounting convention

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 102 “The Financial Reporting Standard
applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland” (“FRS 102") and the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 as
applicable to companies subject to the small companies regime. The disclosure requirements of section 1A of FRS 102
have been applied other than where additional disclosure is required to show a true and fair view.

The financial statements are prepared in sterling, which is the functional currency of the company. Monetary amounts
in these financial statements are rounded to the nearest £.

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention. The principal accounting policies
adopted are set out below.

Revenue
Turnover represents amounts chargeable, net of value added tax, in respect of the provision of training courses to
students, which consists of online E-Learning and practical courses.

E-Learning income is recognised as soon as the company has provided the student access to the online portal. Income
from courses which contain an element of E-Learning and practical courses are split accordingly and the E-Learning
element will be recognised as previously mentioned with the practical courses being recognised as and when the
courses are undertaken. Income deferred is therefore based upon the obligation the company has, as at the year end,
to deliver the courses in the future.

Intangible fixed assets other than goodwill
Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are recognised at cost and are subsequently measured at cost
less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.

Amortisation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over their useful
lives on the following bases:

Software 20% straight line
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost or valuation, net of

depreciation and any impairment losses.

Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over their useful
lives on the following bases:

Leasehold land and buildings 20% straight line
Plant and equipment 20% straight line
Fixtures and fittings 20% straight line

The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the sale proceeds and the
carrying value of the asset, and is credited or charged to profit or loss.

Accounting policies (Continued)

Impairment of non-current assets

At each reporting period end date, the company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to
determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication
exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any).
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the company estimates the
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell. Cost comprises
direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the
inventories to their present location and condition.

Inventories held for distribution at no or nominal consideration are measured at the lower of cost and replacement cost,
adjusted where applicable for any loss of service potential.

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents are basic financial assets and include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other
short-term liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are
shown within borrowings in current liabilities.

Financial instruments
The company has elected to apply the provisions of Section 11 ‘Basic Financial Instruments’ and Section 12 ‘Other
Financial Instruments Issues’ of FRS 102 to all of its financial instruments.

Financial instruments are recognised in the company's statement of financial position when the company becomes
party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

Financial assets and liabilities are offset, with the net amounts presented in the financial statements, when there is a
legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to realise
the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Basic financial assets

Basic financial assets, which include trade and other receivables and cash and bank balances, are initially measured at
transaction price including transaction costs and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest
method unless the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where the transaction is measured at the present
value of the future receipts discounted at a market rate of interest. Financial assets classified as receivable within one
year are not amortised.

Classification of financial liabilities

Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements
entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the company after
deducting all of its liabilities.

1.9

Accounting policies (Continued)

Basic financial liabilities

Basic financial liabilities, including trade and other payables, bank loans, loans from fellow group companies and
preference shares that are classified as debt, are initially recognised at transaction price unless the arrangement
constitutes a financing transaction, where the debt instrument is measured at the present value of the future payments.
discounted at a market rate of interest. Financial liabilities classified as payable within one year are not amortised.

Debt instruments are subsequently carried at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.

Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business
from suppliers. Amounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less. If not, they
are presented as non-current liabilities. Trade payables are recognised initially at transaction price and subsequently
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of transaction costs. Dividends
payable on equity instruments are recognised as liabilities once they are no longer at the discretion of the company.

Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.

Current tax

The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the
income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it
further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The company’s liability for current tax is calculated using
tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting end date.

Deferred tax

Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all timing differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the
extent that it is probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable
profits. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the timing difference arises from goodwill or from the initial
recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting end date and reduced to the extent that it is
no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered,
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the
asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged
or credited directly to equity. in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are offset when the company has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and the
deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority.

Employee benefits
The costs of short-term employee benefits are recognised as a liability and an expense, unless those costs are
required to be recognised as part of the cost of stock or non-current assets.

The cost of any unused holiday entitlement is recognised in the period in which the employee's services are received.

Termination benefits are recognised immediately as an expense when the company is demonstrably committed to
terminate the employment of an employee or to provide termination benefits.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2024

Accounting policies (Continued)

Retirement benefits
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.

Leases

Rentals payable under operating leases, including any lease incentives received, are charged to profit or loss on a
straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease except where another more systematic basis is more
representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leases asset are consumed,

Foreign exchange

Transactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of
the transactions. At each reporting end date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies
are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the reporting end date. Gains and losses arising on translation in the period
are included in profit or loss.

Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty

In the application of the company's accounting policies, the directors are required to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The
estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be
relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are

recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised where the revision affects only that period, or in the period of
the revision and future periods where the revision affects both current and future periods.

Employees

The average monthly number of persons (including directors) employed by the company during the year was:
