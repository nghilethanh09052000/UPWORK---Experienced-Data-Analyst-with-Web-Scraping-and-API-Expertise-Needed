Accounting policies

Company information
Creative Sport & Leisure Limited is a private company limited by shares incorporated in England and Wales. The
registered office is Lower Bam Farm, London Road, Rayleigh, Essex, SS6 9ET.

Accounting convention

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 102 “The Financial Reporting Standard
applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland” {“FRS 102”) and the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 as
applicable to companies subject to the small companies regime. The disclosure requirements of section 1A of FRS 102
have been applied other than where additional disclosure is required to show a true and fair view.

The financial statements are prepared in sterling, which is the functional currency of the company. Monetary amounts
in these financial statements are rounded to the nearest £.

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention. The principal accounting policies
adopted are set out below.

Going concern

At the time of approving the financial statements. the directors have a reasonable expectation that the campany has
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus the directors continue to adopt
the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.

This basis is dependent upon the continuing support of other companies in the group which the directors have
confirmed will continue for the foreseeable future.

Turnover

Turnover is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for services provided in the normal
course of business. and is shown net of VAT and other sales related taxes. The fair value of cansideration takes into
account trade discounts, settlement discounts and volume rebates.

Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost or valuation, net of depreciation
and any impairment losses.

Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over their useful
lives on the following bases:

Fixtures, fittings & equipment 5-10 years straight line
Computer equipment 3 years straight line

The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the sale proceeds and the
carrying value of the asset, and is credited or charged to profit or loss.

Fixed asset investments

Interests in subsidiaries, associates and jointly controlled entities are initially measured at cost and subsequently
measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. The investments are assessed for impairment at each
reporting date and any impairment losses or reversals of impairment losses are recognised immediately in profit or loss

A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the company. Control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies
of the entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.

Accounting policies (Continued)

Impairment of fixed assets

At each reporting period end date, the company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible assets to determine
whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the
recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is
not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the company estimates the recoverable amount
of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.

Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the
estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future
cash flows have not been adjusted.

If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the
carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is
recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the
impairment loss |s treated as a revaluation decrease.

Recognised impairment losses are reversed if, and only if, the reasons for the impairment loss have ceased to apply.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is
increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed
the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or
cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless
the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a
revaluation increase.

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents are basic financial assets and include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other
short-term liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are
shown within borrowings in current liabilities.

Financial instruments
The company has elected to apply the provisions of Section 11 ‘Basic Financial Instruments’ and Section 12 ‘Other
Financial Instruments Issues’ of FRS 102 to all of its financial instruments.

Financial instruments are recognised in the company's balance sheet when the company becomes party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument.

Financial assets and liabilities are offset. with the net amounts presented in the financial statements, when there is a
legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to realise
the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Basic financial assets

Basic financial assets, which include debtors and cash and bank balances, are initially measured at transaction price
including transaction costs and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method unless
the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where the transaction is measured at the present value of the
future receipts discounted at a market rate of interest. Financial assets classified as receivable within one year are not
amortised.

Derecognition of financial assets

Financial assets are derecagnised only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or are
settled, or when the company transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to
another entity, or if some significant risks and rewards of ownership are retained but control of the asset has.
transferred to anather party that is able to sell the asset in its entirety to an unrelated third party.

Accounting policies (Continued)

Classification of financial liabilities

Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements
entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the company after
deducting all of its liabilities.

Basic financial liabilities

Basic financial liabilities, including creditors, bank loans, laans from fellow group companies and preference shares that
are classified as debt, are initially recognised at transaction price unless the arrangement canstitutes a financing
transaction, where the debt instrument is measured at the present value of the future payments discounted at a market
rate of interest. Financial liabilities classified as payable within one year are not amortised.

Debt instruments are subsequently carried at arnortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.

Trade creditors are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business.
from suppliers. Amounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less. If not, they
are presented as non-current liabilities. Trade creditors are recognised initially at transaction price and subsequently
measured at amortised cast using the effective interest method.

Derecognition of financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the company’s contractual obligations expire or are discharged or cancelled.

Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of transaction costs. Dividends
payable on equity instruments are recognised as liabilities once they are no longer at the discretion of the company.

Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.

Current tax

The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the
profit and loss account because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years
and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The company's liability for current tax is calculated
using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting end date.

Deferred tax

Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all timing differences and deferred tax assets are recognised ta the
extent that it is probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable
profits. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the timing difference arises from goodwill or from the initial
recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting end date and reduced to the extent that it is
no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered,
Deferred tax is calculated al the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the
asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the profit and lass account. except when it relates to items
charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are offset when the company has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and the
deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority.

Accounting policies (Continued)

Employee benefits
The costs of short-term employee benefits are recognised as a liability and an expense, unless those costs are
required to be recognised as part of the cost of stock or fixed assets.

The cost of any unused holiday entitlement is recognised in the period in which the employee’s services are received.

Termination benefits are recognised immediately as an expense when the company is demonstrably committed to
terminate the employment of an employee or to provide termination benefits.

Retirement benefits
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.

Leases
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards
of ownership to the lessees. All other leases are classified as operating leases.

Rentals payable under operating leases, including any lease incentives received, are charged to profit or loss on a
straight line basis aver the term of the relevant lease except where anather mare systematic basis is more
representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leases asset are consumed.

Government grants
Government grants are recognised at the fair value of the asset received or receivable when there is reasonable
assurance that the grant conditions will be met and the grants will be received.

Agrant that specifies performance conditions is recagnised in income when the performance conditions are met.

Where a grant does not specify performance conditions it is recognised in income when the proceeds are received or
receivable, A grant received before the recognition criteria are satisfied is recognised as a liability.

Exceptional items
Exceptional items are separately disclosed where they are material and relevant to an understanding of financial
performance.
