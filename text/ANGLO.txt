STRATEGIC REPORT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023

Introduction

Anglo American Technica) & Sustainability Services Ltd (the "Company") provides management, technical and
consultancy services to companies in the Anglo American Group (the "Group"). The directors are not aware, at
the date of this report, of any likely major changes in the Company's activities in the next year.

Business review

As reported in the Company’s Statement of comprehensive income, the Company has incurred a loss after tax
for the year of $346,180,000 compared to a loss of $493,441 ,000 in the prior year. The decrease in the loss is as
a result of a cost reduction programme and a scaling back of certain activities. Certain activities, largely relating
to exploration, research and development, are not recharged to the rest of the Group and largely account for the
loss in the Company.

The Balance sheet shows that the Company is in a net liability position of $205,041,000 for the year compared to
a net asset position of $107,727,000 in the prior year.

Principal risks and uncertainties and financial risk management policies

The directors considered the risks attached to the Company's investments in group companies and financial
instruments, which principally comprise loans to and from other group companies. The directors have taken a
prudent approach in their consideration of the risks. Due to the nature of the Company's activities, the
Company’s exposure to price risk, liquidity risk and cash flow risk is not material for the assessment of assets,
liabilities and the financial statements. Credit risk is not considered to be material on the basis that the
Company's debtor balances are due from other companies within the Anglo American Group and those
companies are considered to have sufficient liquidity or financial support to be able to settle amounts owed to the
Company.

STRATEGIC REPORT (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023

Understanding our employees and helping our people thrive

The employees being referred to in this section are employed by the group of companies headed by the
Company in capacity of Parent Company.

The Company knows that our people are critical to everything we do. We create safe, inclusive and diverse
working environments that encourage and support high performance and innovative thinking. The Company
acknowledges that to get the best from our people there is a need to understand their viewpoints and address
any concerns that may be raised.

To deliver our strategic business objectives, we rely on a capable and engaged workforce that behaves ethically
and responsibly, consistent with Anglo American’s Values and Code of Conduct; essential for us to maintain our
social licence to operate. We aim to foster a purpose-led high performance, inclusive culture, through an
organisational structure that is fit for purpose, resourcing this structure by attracting and retaining the best talent
and empowering leadership to deliver the desired outcomes.

As the Company consider workforce engagement to be a priority for every leader at Anglo American, regular
surveys are run to identify areas where more must be done to ensure colleagues feel cared for and respected.
The Group has established a Global Workforce Advisory Panel made up of employee representatives and
chaired by a senior independent director, with the intention of giving employees more of a voice in the boardroom
so that their views can be better understood and considered when decisions are being made about the future of
the business.

Relationships with Suppliers and Customers

The Company engages with suppliers through several channels, in line with the Group’s sustainable and
responsible supplier progress. The Company also engages with customers through direct personal engagement
and via business and industry forums.

Key performance indicators

The directors consider the Company's key performance indicators to be the control of and cost effective spend
on management and technical services for the benefit of certain companies in the Group. This performance is
monitored by the directors by way of management reports.

The employees of the Company work in partnership with Businesses and other Group functions to deliver the
Group’s goals on its seven pillars of value: Safety & Health, Environment, Socio-Political, People, Production,
Cost and Financial. The performance and tracking of key initiatives are monitored and discussed on a monthly
basis with the Technical Leadership team, and our Balanced Scorecard is presented quarterly at the Technical
Townhalls. The directors consider the Company's key performance indicators to be the following:

e Operating Costs - control of and cost effective spend on management and technical services for the benefit
of certain companies in the Group. This performance is monitored by the directors by way of management
reports. The operating costs have decreased from $475,454,000 in 2022 to $324,703,000 in 2023 mainly as
a result of reduced expenditure relating to research and development costs and recharges from related
undertakings.

STRATEGIC REPORT (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023

e Revenue - The Group’s purpose is summarised as ‘to re-imagine mining to improve people’s lives’, and the
Company is focused on contributing to the achievement of this purpose via the provision of services to the
Businesses. The Company's Revenue represents recharges to the Businesses for those services provided
(in compliance with Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) specific guidelines)
and is monitored by the Technical Leadership team on a quarterly basis. Revenue has decreased form
$282,916,000 in 2022 to $231,198,000 in 2023 as a result of lower management, technical and consultancy
services charged to other Group companies within the United Kingdom and other geographical areas.

Section 172(1) statement

The Company Board is cognisant of its legal duty to act in good faith and to promote the success of the
Company for the benefit of its shareholders and with regard to the interests of stakeholders and other factors.

relationships we have with all our stakeholders; the interests of our employees; the impact our operations have

business conduct.

Stakeholder considerations are integral to discussions at Board meetings and the decisions we make take into
account any potential impacts on them and the environment. Like any business, we are aware that some of the
decisions we make may have an adverse impact on certain stakeholders.

By listening to, understanding and engaging with our stakeholders, the Board endeavours to live up to their
expectations, by staying true to the Purpose and making decisions in accordance with our Values.

Our Purpose and values

The Board recognises the role of the Company's business in society and within the Anglo American Group. The

behaviour and shape our culture, and are fundamental to creating enduring benefit for all our employees,
shareholders, and stakeholders in a way that demonstrably improves people’s lives.

performance are likely to affect or be of significant interest to our stakeholders, and provide the opportunity to co-
create effective and lasting solutions to business and other challenges.

DIRECTORS' REPORT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023

The directors present their report and the audited financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023.
Statement of directors’ responsibilities in respect of the financial statements

The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual report and the financial statements in accordance with
applicable law and regulation.

Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the
directors have prepared the financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure
Framework”, and applicable law).

Under company law, directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of the profit or loss of the company for that period.
\n preparing the financial statements, the directors are required to:

° select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;

° state whether applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101 have been followed,
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements;

. make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and

. prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the

company will continue in business.

The directors are responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and hence for taking reasonable steps
for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

The directors are also responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and
explain the company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of
the company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006..

Directors’ confirmations
In the case of each director in office at the date the directors’ report is approved:

. so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company's auditors are
unaware, and

. they have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as a director in order to make themselves.
aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of that
information.

Principal activities

The Company provides management, technical and consultancy services to certain companies in the Anglo
American Group (the “Group"). The directors have the present intention of maintaining the business in its current
form for the foreseeable future.

Branches of the Company are established in Australia, Chile, Portugal and South Africa. The Australia branch
has recognised a profit before tax for the year of $5,544,000 (2022 - profit of $6,206,000), Chile branch has
recognised a profit of $3,686,000 (2022 - profit of $4,501,000) and the Portugal branch has recognised a loss of

Principal risks and uncertainties and financial risk management policies
The financial risk management policies of the Company are disclosed in the Strategic Report.
Future developments

The directors are not aware, at the date of this report, of any likely major changes in the Company’s activities in
the next year.

Going concern

The directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in
operational existence for the foreseeable future for the period of at least a year from the date of approval of the
financial statements. Thus, they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual
financial statements. :

The Company's ability to operate as a going concern is assessed in conjunction with the Group as it is
dependent upon the ability of the Group companies to settle their intercompany balances with the Company and
to provide funds for working capital and other needs.

The directors have also received a commitment of financial support from Anglo American plc for use to the
extent that it is necessary, including but not limited to, not seeking repayment of amounts advanced to the
Company by the Group unless alternative financing has been secured by the Company and advancing further
amounts to the Company as required. This support will remain in place for the foreseeable future, including the
period of at least a year from authorisation of the Company's financial statements. In performing their going
concern assessment, the directors have considered the ability of the Group to provide such financial support,
and have satisfied themselves as to the adequacy of the commitment of financial support.

. Engagement with employees

To deliver our strategic business objectives, we rely on a capable and engaged workforce that behaves ethically
and responsibly, consistent with Anglo American's Values and Code of Conduct; essential for us to maintain our
social licence to operate. We aim to foster a purpose-led high performance, inclusive culture, through an
organisational structure that is fit for purpose, resourcing this structure by attracting and retaining the best talent

Advisory Panel made up of employee representatives and chaired by a senior independent director, with the
intention of giving employees more of a voice in the boardroom so that their views can be better understood and
considered when decisions are being made about the future of the business.

Committee, awards free shares up to the maximum permissible within an HMRC approved SIP scheme.

To achieve a common awareness of all employees in relation to the financial and economic factors that affect
the performance of the Company, employees are kept informed on matters affecting their working lives and the
performance of the Group through CEO briefing updates, announcements on the Company's intranet, formal
and informal meetings at local level and direct written communications.

employees in the workforce who become disabled during their employment. Where possible the Company will
adjust a person's working environment to enable them to stay in employment.

Independent auditors’ report to the members
of Anglo American Technical & Sustainability
Services Ltd

Report on the audit of the financial statements

Opinion
In our opinion, Anglo American Technical & Sustainability Services Ltd’s financial statements:

e give a true and fair view of the state of the company’s affairs as at 31 December 2023 and of its loss for the year
then ended;

e have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United
Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”, and applicable law); and

® have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Report, which comprise: the balance sheet as
at 31 December 2023; the statement of comprehensive income and the statement of changes in equity for the year
then ended; and the notes to the financial statements, comprising material accounting policy information and other
explanatory information.

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law.
Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial
statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate
to provide a basis for our opinion.

Independence

We remained independent of the company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit
of the financial statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

Conclusions relating to going concern

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or
conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a going
concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of
accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this conclusion is not a guarantee as to the
company's ability to continue as a going concern.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant
sections of this report.

Reporting on other information

The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and
our auditors’ report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial
statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to
the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon.

in connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in
doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our
knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material
inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a
material misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on
the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are
required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.

With respect to the Strategic report and Directors' report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by
the UK Companies Act 2006 have been included.

Based on our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006 requires us also to report certain
opinions and matters as described below.

Strategic report and Directors’ report

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic report
and Directors' report for the year ended 31 December 2023 is consistent with the financial statements and has been
prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

In light of the knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit,
we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic report and Directors' report.

Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit

Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements

As explained more fully in the Statement of directors’ responsibilities in respect of the financial statements, the
directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework
and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The directors are also responsible for such internal control
as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the company’s ability to continue as
a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of
accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic
alternative but to do so.

Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with
ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and
are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in
line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including
fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below.

Based on our understanding of the company and industry, we identified that the principal risks of non-compliance
with laws and regulations related to the Companies Act 2006 and applicable tax legislation, and we considered the
extent to which non-compliance might have a material effect on the financial statements. We evaluated
management's incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the financial statements (including the
risk of override of controls), and determined that the principal risks were related to inappropriate journal entries and
management bias in significant accounting judgements and estimates. Audit procedures performed by the
engagement team included:

e Understanding and evaluating the design and implementation of controls designed and detect irregularities and
fraud;
Reviewing minutes of meetings of those charged with governance;
Inquiry of management regarding its consideration of known or suspected instances of non-compliance with laws
and regulations and fraud;

e Identifying and testing journal entries, in particular and journal entries posted with unusual account combinations;
and

e Challenging assumptions and judgements made by management in respect of critical accounting judgements and
significant accounting estimates, and assessing these judgements and estimates for management bias.

There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above. We are less likely to become aware of
instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations that are not closely related to events and transactions
reflected in the financial statements. Also, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher
than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may invoive deliberate concealment by, for example,
forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website
at: www. frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors’ report.

Use of this report

This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these
opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown
or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.

Other required reporting

Companies Act 2006 exception reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:

e we have not obtained all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or

e adequate accounting records have not been kept by the company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been
received from branches not visited by us; or

¢ certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or

e the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.

We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023

General information

Anglo American Technical & Sustainability Services Ltd is a private company limited by shares,
incorporated in the United Kingdom and registered in England and Wales. Branches of the Company are
established in Australia, Chile, Portugal and South Africa. The activities of the branches include
management, technical and consultancy services.

The nature of the Company's operations and principal activities is set out in the Directors’ report.
The address of the registered office is given on the Company Information page.

Material accounting policies
2.1 Basis of preparation of financial statements

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention unless otherwise
specified within these accounting policies and in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101
"Reduced Disclosure Framework’ and the Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies using
FRS 101.

Group financial statements are not presented as the Company is directly a wholly owned subsidiary
undertaking of Anglo American plc, a company incorporated in the United Kingdom and registered in
England and Wales. Accordingly, these financial statements present information about the Company
as an individual undertaking and not about its group. Consolidated financial statements have not
been prepared because the Company is exempt under s400 of the Companies Act 2006 as
applicable to companies using FRS 101.

The preparation of financial statements in compliance with FRS 101 requires the use of certain
critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise judgment in applying the
Company's accounting policies (see note 3).

Changes in accounting policies and disclosures

The accounting policies applied are consistent with those adopted and disclosed in the financial
statements for the year ended 31 December 2022.

Going concern

The directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue
in operational existence for the foreseeable future for the period of at least a year from the date of
approval of the financial statements. Thus, they continue to adopt the going concern basis of
accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.

The Company’s ability to operate as a going concern is assessed in conjunction with the Group as it
is dependent upon the ability of the Group companies to settle their intercompany balances with the
Company and to provide funds for working capital and other needs.

The directors have also received a commitment of financial support from Anglo American pic for use
to the extent that it is necessary, including but not limited to, not seeking repayment of amounts
advanced to the Company by the Group unless alternative financing has been secured by the
Company and advancing further amounts to the Company as required. This support will remain in
place for the foreseeable future, including the period of at least a year from authorisation of the
Company's financial statements. In performing their going concern assessment, the directors have
considered the ability of the Group to provide such financial support, and have satisfied themselves
as to the adequacy of the commitment of financial support.

Foreign currency translation
Functional and presentation currency

The Company's functional and presentation currency is United States Dollars (USD) as this is the
currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company operates.

Transactions and balances

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the spot exchange
rates at the dates of the transactions.

At each period end foreign currency monetary items are translated using the closing rate. Non-
monetary items measured at historical cost are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the
transaction and non-monetary items measured at fair value are measured using the exchange rate
when fair value was determined.

Revenue

Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the
Company and the revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is measured as the fair value of the
consideration received or receivable. The following criteria must also be met before revenue is
recognised:

Rendering of services

Revenue from providing services is recognised in the accounting period in which the services are
rendered.

Interest income
interest income is recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method.

Finance costs

‘Finance costs are charged to profit or loss over the term of the debt using the ‘effective interest

method so that the amount charged is at a constant rate on the carrying amount. Issue costs.are
initially recognised as a reduction in the proceeds of the associated capital instrument.

2.9

Pensions
Defined contribution pension plan

The Company operates a defined contribution plan for its employees. A defined contribution plan is a
pension plan under which the Company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. Once the
contributions have been paid the Company has no further payment obligations.

The contributions are recognised as an expense in profit or loss when they fall due. Amounts not paid
are shown in accruals as a liability in the Balance sheet. The assets of the plan are held separately
from the Company in independently administered funds.

Defined benefit pension scheme

The Company operates a defined benefit pension scheme for which full actuarial valuations are
carried out at least every three years using the projected unit credit method and updates are
performed for each financial year end. The average discount rate for the plans’ liabilities is based on
AA rated corporate bonds of a suitable duration and currency or, where there is no deep. market for
such bonds, is based on government bonds.

Remeasurements comprising actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the
Statement of changes in equity and are not recycled to profit or loss. Any increase in the present
value of plan liabilities expected to arise from employee service during the year is charged to
operating profit. The net interest cost on the net defined benefit liability is inciuded in interest
expense.

Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested and
otherwise amortised on a straight line basis over the average period until the benefits vest. The
retirement benefit obligation recognised on the balance sheet represents the present value of the
deficit of the defined benefit plans.

Share based payments

Where share options are awarded to employees, the fair value of the options at the date of grant is
charged to profit or loss over the vesting period. Non-market vesting conditions are taken into
account by adjusting the number of equity instruments expected to vest at each balance sheet date
so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is based on the number
of options that eventually vest. Market vesting conditions are factored into the fair value of the options
granted. The cumulative expense is not adjusted for failure to achieve a market vesting condition.

The fair value of the award also takes into account non-vesting conditions. These are either factors
beyond the control of either party (such as a target based on an index) or factors which are within the
control of one or other of the parties (such as the Company keeping the scheme open or the
employee maintaining any contributions required by the scheme).

Where the terms and conditions of options are modified before they vest, the increase in the fair
value of the options, measured immediately before and after the modification, is also charged to profit
or loss over the remaining vesting period.

When the share awards vest, the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is
transferred from the capital contribution reserve to the profit and loss account.

Material accounting policies (continued)

2.10 Taxation

Tax is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income, except to the extent that it relates to
items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also
recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.

The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of tax rates and laws that have been
enacted by the balance sheet date or substantively enacted in the countries where the Company
operates and generates income.

Deferred tax balances are recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not
reversed by the Balance sheet date, except that:

. The recognition of deferred tax assets is limited to the extent that it is probable that they will be
recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits; and

° Any deferred tax balances are reversed if and when all conditions for retaining associated tax
allowances have been met.

Deferred tax balances are not recognised in respect of permanent differences except in respect of
business combinations, when deferred tax is recognised on the differences between the fair values of
assets acquired and the future tax deductions available for them and the differences between the fair
values of liabilities acquired and the amount that will be assessed for tax. Deferred tax is determined
using tax rates and laws that have been enacted by the balance sheet date.

2.11 Intangible assets
Intangible assets are initially recognised at cost. After recognition, under the cost model, intangible
assets are measured at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment
losses.
The estimated useful lives range as follows:

Software - 5 years

Capital work in progress is not amortised.

2.12 Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets under the cost model are stated at historical cost less accumulated
depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Historical cost includes expenditure that is

directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of
operating in the manner intended by management.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023

Material accounting policies (continued)

2.12 Tangible fixed assets (continued)

Depreciation is charged so as to allocate the cost of assets less their residual value over their
estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method.

Depreciation is provided on the following basis:

Plant and machinery - 5 years
The assets’ residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted
prospectively if appropriate, or if there is an indication of a significant change since the last reporting

date.

Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount
and are recognised in profit or loss.

2.13 Debtors

Short term debtors are measured at transaction price, less any impairment. Loans receivable are
measured initially at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are measured subsequently at amortised
cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment.

2.14 Cash and cash equivalents

Cash is represented by cash in hand and deposits with financial institutions repayable without penalty
on notice of not more than 24 hours. Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments that mature in no
more than three months from the date of acquisition and that are readily convertible to known
amounts of cash with insignificant risk of change in value.

2.15 Creditors

Creditors are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course
of business from suppliers.

Creditors are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the
effective interest method. ;

2.16 Amounts owed by group undertakings

Amounts owed by group undertakings are measured initially at fair value, plus any directly attributable
transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the
effective interest method.

2.17 Government grants

Grants from the government are recognised at their fair value where there is a reasonable assurance
that the grant will be received and that the Company will comply with all attached conditions.

Government grants relating to costs are recognised in the Statement of comprehensive income over
the period necessary to match them with the costs that they are intended to compensate.

During the year, the Company has claimed Research and Development expenditure credit (RDEC) in
respect of pre-tax costs incurred on research and development projects. See note 6 for further
details.

2.18 Financial instruments

The Company recognises financial instruments when it becomes a party to the contractual
arrangements of the instrument. Financial instruments are de-recognised when they are discharged
or when the contractual terms expire. The Company's accounting policies in respect of financial
instruments transactions are explained below:

Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value.
Financial assets

All recognised financial assets are subsequently measured in their entirety at either fair value or
amortised cost, depending on the classification of the financial assets.

Debt instruments at amortised cost

Debt instruments are subsequently measured at amortised cost where they are financial assets held
within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash
flows and selling the financial assets, and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on
specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal
amount outstanding. Amortised cost is calculated using the effective interest method and represents
the amount measured at initial recognition less repayments of principal plus the cumulative
amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference between the initial amount and the
maturity amount, adjusted for any loss allowance.

Impairment of financial assets

The Company recognises a loss allowance for expected credit losses on investments in debt
instruments that are measured at amortised cost or at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive
Income ("FVOCI"). The amount of expected credit losses is updated at each reporting date to reflect
changes in credit risk since initial recognition of the respective financial instrument.

The Company monitors all financial assets that are subject to loss allowance requirements to assess
whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. If there has been
a significant increase in credit risk, the Company will measure the loss allowance based on lifetime
rather than 12-month probability of default (PD). The Company has adopted the practical expedient
that any financial assets with ‘low’ credit risk at the reporting date are deemed not to have had a
significant increase in credit risk.

2.18 Financial instruments (continued)
Financial liabilities
At amortised cost

Financial liabilities which are neither contingent consideration of an acquirer in a business
combination, held for trading, nor designated as at fair value through profit or loss are subsequently
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. This is a method of calculating the
amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period. The
effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the
expected life of the financial liability, or where appropriate a shorter period, to the amortised cost of a
financial liability.

Judgments in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty

The Company has identified a critical judgement relating to a key source of estimation regarding
recoverability of loans and impairment of intangible assets.

Determining recoverability of loans

The Company assesses the recoverability of loans to group undertakings and makes provision in the
event that full recovery is not expected. The recoverability of loans is assessed by application of the
expected credit loss model along with a qualitative assessment. The expected credit losses on
receivables are estimated by reference to past default experience and credit rating, adjusted for current
observable data. .

Impairment of intangible assets

At each balance sheet date, management assesses whether there is any indication that the intangible
assets may be impaired. In assessing whether there is any indication that the intangible assets may be
impaired, management uses judgement and takes into account several external and internal sources of
information. The directors have considered all relevant sources of information and concluded that there
are no indicators that the intangible assets may be impaired.

Factors that may affect future tax charges

The Finance Act 2021 included measures to increase the standard rate of UK corporation tax to 25% with
effect from 1 April 2023. This rate is applicable to the measurement of deferred tax balances at 31
December 2023.

On 23 March 2023, HM Treasury released draft legislation for the Global Minimum Tax (‘Pillar 2’) rules in
the UK which was substantively enacted on 20 June 2023. These rules will apply to the full Anglo
American Group from the financial year ended 31 December 2024 onwards. Further information regarding
the group's Pillar Two position is detailed in the consolidated financial statements of Anglo American plc.
The Company has applied the mandatory temporary exception under IAS 12 in relation to the accounting
for deferred taxes arising from the implementation of the Pillar 2 rules.
