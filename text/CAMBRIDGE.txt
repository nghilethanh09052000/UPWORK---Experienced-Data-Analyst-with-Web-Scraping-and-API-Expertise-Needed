FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023

1 Accounting policies

Company information

Cambridge Spark Limited is a private company limited by shares and is registered and incorporated in
England and Wales. The registered office is Blenheim House, Newmarket Road, Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk,
IP33 3SB.

Accounting convention

These .financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 102 “The Financial Reporting
Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland” (“FRS 102”) and the requirements of the Companies
Act 2006 as applicable to companies subject to the small companies regime. The disclosure requirements of
section 1A of FRS 102 have been applied other than where additional disclosure is required to show a true
and fair view. :

The financial statements are prepared in sterling, which is the functional currency of the company. Monetary
amounts in these financial statements are rounded to the nearest £.

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention. The principal accounting
policies adopted are set out below.

Going concern

At the time of approving the financial statements, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the
company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for 12 months from the signing date.
Thus the directors continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial
statements.

The accounts do not include any adjustments, that might be found to be necessary, should it transpire that the
going concern basis is no longer appropriate. :

Turnover

Turnover comprises revenue recognised by the company in respect of corporate training, apprenticeships and
skills bootcamps. Turnover is recognised as the fair value of the consideration received or receivable.

Apprenticeship revenue is earned from the provision of training and mentoring support, and the learners
completion of the end-point assessment (EPA). Training revenue is recognised over time as the service is
delivered on a straight line basis. EPA revenue is recognised at the point a learner commences the
assessment on the basis of the similar nature of the arrangements and the company can reliably measure the
historical success rate.

Where the revenue is subject to potential clawback, the company makes a provision based on historical
attrition rates and the status of individual learner progress.

Corporate training and skills bootcamp revenue is recognised over time as the service is delivered using a
milestone based approach. Where these activities are part of a wider contract and the company acts as a
subcontractor, the company evaluates whether the terms and conditions expose it to similar risks and rewards
as if it were the main contractor. In each case the company's assessment is that they are acting as principal.

Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost, net of depreciation
and any impairment losses.


CAMBRIDGE SPARK LIMITED

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023

1 Accounting policies (Continued)

Tangible fixed assets (continued)
Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost of assets less their residual values over their useful lives
on the following bases:

Plant and equipment 3 years straight line
Office furniture and equipment 3 years straight line
Fixtures and fittings 4 years straight line

The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the sale
proceeds and the carrying value of the asset, and is credited or charged to profit or loss.

Borrowing costs
All borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash is represented by cash in hand and deposits with financial institutions repayable without penalty on
notice of not more than 24 hours. Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments that mature in no more than
three months from the date of acquisition and that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash with
insignificant risk of change in value.

Financial instruments
The company has elected to apply the provisions of Section 11 ‘Basic Financial Instruments’ and Section 12
‘Other Financial Instruments Issues’ of FRS 102 to all of its financial instruments.

Financial instruments are recognised when the company becomes party to the contractual provisions of the
instrument.

Financial assets and liabilities are offset, with the net amounts presented in the financial statements, when
there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a
net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Basic financial assets

Basic financial assets, which include trade debtors, are initially measured at transaction price including
transaction costs and are subsequently carried at amortised cost, being the transaction prices less any
amounts settled and any impairment losses.

Classification of financial liabilities

Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual
arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the
assets of the company after deducting all of its liabilities.

Basic financial liabilities

Basic financial liabilities, including trade and other creditors, amounts owed to group undertakings and
accruals are initially recognised at transaction price and are subsequently measured at amortised costs, being
transaction price less amounts settled.

Equity instruments

Equity instruments issued by the company are recorded at the fair value of proceeds received, net of
transaction costs. Dividends payable on equity instruments are recognised as liabilities once they are no
longer at the discretion of the company.

Accounting policies (Continued)

Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the current tax expense and deferred tax expense. Current tax assets
are recognised when tax paid exceeds the tax payable.

Current and deferred tax is charged or credited to profit or loss, except when it relates to items charged or
credited to other comprehensive income or equity, when the tax follows the transaction or event it relates to
and is also charged or credited to other comprehensive income, or equity.

Current tax assets and current tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset, if
and only if, there is a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and the entity intends either to settle on
the net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year. Current tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax
tates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.

Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised
or the liability is settled based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting
date.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised in respect of all timing differences that exist at the reporting date. Timing
differences are differences between taxable profits and total comprehensive income that arise from the
inclusion of income and expenses in tax assessments in different periods from their recognition in the
financial statements. Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that they will be
tecovered by the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.

Deferred tax is recognised on income and expenses from subsidiaries, associates, branches and interests in
jointly controlled entities, that will be assessed to or allow for tax in a future period except where the company
is able to control the reversal of the timing difference and it is probable that the timing difference will not
reverse in the foreseeable future.

Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the value of assets (other than goodwill) and liabilities
tecognised in a business combination and the amounts that can be deducted or assessed for tax. The
deferred tax recognised is adjusted against goodwill.

Pensions

The company operates a defined contribution plan for its employees and also contributes to the self invested
personal pension of the director. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Company pays
fixed contributions into a separate entity. Once the contributions have been paid the Company has no further
payment obligations.

The contributions are recognised as an expense in the profit or loss when they fall due. Amounts not paid are
shown in other creditors as a liability in the Balance Sheet. The assets of the plan are held separately from
the Company in independently administered funds. ,

Share-based payments

Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant by reference to the fair
value of the equity instruments granted using the Black Scholes model. The fair value determined at the
grant date is expensed on a straightline basis over the vesting period, based on the estimate of shares that
will eventually vest. A corresponding adjustment is made to equity.

Accounting policies (Continued)

Share-based payments (continued)

When the terms and conditions of equity-settled share-based payments at the time. they were granted are
subsequently modified, the fair value of the share-based payment under the original terms and conditions and
under the modified terms and conditions are both determined at the date of the modification. Any excess of
the modified fair value over the original fair value is recognised over the remaining vesting period in addition
to the grant date fair value of the original share-based payment. The share-based payment expense is not
adjusted if the modified fair value is less than the original fair value. ,

Cancellations or settlements (including those resulting from employee redundancies) are treated as an
acceleration of vesting and the amount that would have been recognised over the remaining vesting period is
recognised immediately.

Leases
Rentals payable under operating leases, are charged to profit or loss on a straight line basis over the term of
the relevant lease.

Foreign exchange
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency (foreign currency) are initially recorded at the
exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction.

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling
at the reporting date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at
the rate ruling at the date of the transaction, or, if the asset or liability is measured at fair value, the rate when
that fair value was determined.

’ All translation differences are taken to profit or loss, except to the extent that they relate to gains or losses on

non-monetary items recognised in other comprehensive income, when the related translation gain or loss is
also recognised in other comprehensive income.

Research and development

Research and development costs are written off to the Profit and Loss Account in the period in which they are
incurred. ;

The company operates an EMI option scheme.

The share options have a vesting period of between 2 and 4 years, subject to certain conditions. Options
expire 10 years after grant.

All goods and services received in exchange for the grant of any share-based payments are measured at their
fair values.

Where employees are rewarded using their share-based payments, the fair value of the employees’ services
is determined indirectly by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted. This fair value is
appraised at the grant date and excludes the impact of non-market vesting conditions.

All share based remuneration is ultimately recognised as an expense in profit or loss with a corresponding
credit to retained earnings. If vesting periods or other vesting conditions apply, the expense is allocated over
the vesting period, based on the best available estimate of the number of share options expected to vest.

Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to
become exercisable. Estimates are subsequently revised if there is any indication that the number of share
options expected to vest differs from previous estimates. Any adjustment to the cumulative share-based
compensation resulting from a revision is recognised in the current period. The number of vested options
ultimately exercised by holders does not impact the expense recorded in any period.

Upon exercise of share options, the proceeds received, net of any directly attributable transaction costs, are
allocated to share capital up to the nominal (or par) value of the shares issued with any excess being
recorded as share premium.

The directors consider that the grant of instruments under the scheme does not give rise to a material share
based payment charge and the amount charged to the profit and loss account in the year is £nil (2022: E£nil).
