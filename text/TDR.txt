Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland" including the provisions of Section
1A "Small Entities" and the Companies Act 2006. The disclosure requirements of section 1A of FRS 102 have

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of preparing the financial statements

Going concern

In the year ending 31 July 2024, a profit before tax of £535,331. The company has a net asset position
£652,785 (2023 - £295,454). This includes net current assets of £191,503.

Given the balance sheet position, the entity is reliant on the parent company charity for support. A letter of
support has been received confirming the ongoing support for a period of at least 12 month from approval of
the financial statements.

The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which means that the group and entity
is able to operate for the foreseeable future on the basis of known and projected resources.

The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which means that the is company is
able to operate for the foreseeable future on the basis of known and projected resources. The group has an
overdraft facility of £100,000 in. place with Lloyds Bank until July 2025, together with a bank
loan/mortgage.Based on discussions with the bank, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the
overdraft facility will be reviewed on an equivalent basis at the renewal date.

The senior management team have prepared a case cash glow forecast for the period ending August 2026.
This has been used to establish and assure the validity of the business as a going concern. The senior
management team have also prepared a severe downside scenario forecast as part of this assessment. The
assumptions in the downside scenario forecast include the following:

~ Only contracted commercial income has been recognised i.e no new commercial income despite the business
continuing to seek additional source of income.

~ No external rental income in the period to July 2025.

- Under performance in certain aspects of other income activities.

- Cost mitigation savings as a result of the above.

Both the base case forecast, and the severe downside forecast show that the group and the company are
expected to operate within the current overdraft facility and will maintain sufficient cash funds to continue to
trade.

Consequently, the Directors are confident that the company will have sufficient funds to continue to meet their
liabilities as they fall due and for at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements and
therefore have prepared the financial statements on a going concern ba!

Turnover

Income from grants, contracts and other services rendered is included to the extent of the completion of the
contract or service concerned. All income from short term deposits is credited to the profit and loss account in
the period in which it is earned.

Government grants
Government grants are recognised at the fair value of the asset received or receivable when there
reasonable assurance that the grant conditions will be met and the grants will be received.

A grant that specifies performance conditions is recognised in income when the performance conditions are
met. Where a grant does not specify performance conditions it is recognised in income when the proceeds are
received or receivable. A grant received before the recognition criteria are satisfied is recognised as a liability.

Intangible fixed assets - negative goodwill
Negative goodwill arises when the cost of a business combination is less that the fair value of net assets
acquired. Negative goodwill in excess of their fair values of the non monetary assets acquired is credited to
profit and loss in the periods expected to benefit, which the directors consider to be 4 years.

losses,

The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the sale proceeds
and the carrying value of the asset, and is credited or charged to profit or loss.

Impairment of fixed assets . .
At each reporting period end, the company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and-intangible assets
to determine whether there is any Indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any ‘such

‘Indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in ofdér to determine. the extent of the

impairment loss (if any).

Cash and cash equivalents

bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities.

of its financial instruments.

Financial instruments are recognised when the company becomes party to the contractual provisions of the
instrument.

basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

market rate of interest,

Classification of financial liabilities:

Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual
arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the
assets of the company after deducting all of its liabilities.

Basis financial liabilities:

Taxation

The tax expense represents the sum of the current tax expense and deferred tax expense. Current tax assets
are recognised when the tax paid exceeds the tax payable.

Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised
or the tax liability is settled based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the
reporting date.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised in respect of ail timing differences that exist at the reporting date.
Timing differences are differences between taxable profits and total comprehensive income that arise from the
inclusion of income and expenses in tax assessments in different periods from their recognition in the financial
statements.Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered
by the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.

Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the valve of assets (other than goodwill) and _ liabilities
recognised in a business combination and the amounts that can be deducted or assessed for tax. The deferred
tax recognised is adjusted against goodwill.

Employee benefits
The costs of shart term employee benefits are recognised as a liability and an expense, unless those costs are
required to be recognised as part of the cost of stock or fixed assets.

received. ae
