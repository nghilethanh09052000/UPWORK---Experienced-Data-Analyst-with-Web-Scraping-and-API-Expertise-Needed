Hays Travel Limited
Chairs’ Report
Year ended 30 April 2024

|_am pleased to present the report and consolidated financial statements for Hays Travel Limited (the Company’)
and its subsidiary undertakings, together known as the Hays Group of Companies (‘the Group’), for the year
ended 30th April 2024.

Group Total Transaction Value (TTV) for the year ended 30 April 2024 was £2.5bn, an increase of 17% versus 30
April 2023 (£2.2bn). Group Turnover was £457m, an increase of 8% versus 30 April 2023 (423m).

Group PBT in the year ended 30 April 2024 was £73m, an increase of 43% versus 30 April 2023 (£51m).

Results for the year ended 30 April 2024 have exceeded expectations, a significant factor in this was the
increasing consumer confidence in travel. Whilst world events and supplier changes have previously resulted in
significant cancellations, this year customers are travelling more often and further afield.

The Group has delivered on its plans for growth in all areas. Our Independence Group continues to attract new
members, turnover in our homeworking division has increased over 31%, and foreign exchange achieved
turnover of £24.8m (2023: £21.5m) in the year as a result of customer departures increasing.

The Group continues to have a committed and loyal work force and the company continues to provide
outstanding training and development and supports a significant number of apprentices and graduates -
more , thafi 1'760.in the current year.

During the year the company made three acquisitions which added 67 shops to its retail estate.

The Group successfully attracts new customers and 37% of customers were new to Hays Travel and the
previously acquired Thomas Cook shops. This is attributed to the commitment to continued customer service
excellence, the latent demand for holidays, as well as customers seeking the reassurance and expertise that
comes with booking through an agent.

Investment in the Company's retail refurbishment programme, new Unified Business Platform technology and
other in year objectives was £14.8m.

Moving forward, the Group will continue with its clear business plan for growth in its Retail, Independence Group,
Foreign Exchange, Franchise and Homeworking Divisions, and continuance of its rapid growth in the Cruise and
Touring sectors.

The Group has recognised its requirement to report under SECR Legislation and has a clear strategy on
its approach to reducing its emissions and aligning to relevant standards in the future, including its Net
Zero ambitions. The Group is taking action to reduce scope 1 and 2 emissions as well as exploring ways to
reduce scope 3. The group has voluntarily reported for the first time under UKCFD requirements as it
approaches the threshold for mandatory reporting under new UK legislation. The Group is a supporter of
sustainable tourism and its charitable work through both the Hays Travel Foundation and its Retail
Community Fund which are fully restored to pre-pandemic levels.

The Hays Travel Foundation continues to fund organisations to help young people to achieve and be the best
they can be, in their health, sport, the arts, and education. The Group also funds all its stores to contribute to
community and charitable causes in the places where they operate.

The ongoing commitment, capacity and capability of people mean that the Group is well prepared to continue its

trajectory of growth in 2024-25, with a focus on customer excellence, investing in its people and communities,
and sustainability.

Hays Travel Limited
Strategic Report
Year ended 30 April 2024

The Group's principal activity during the year continued to be that of a travel agent, operating retail outlets,
homeworking, and call centres. The business has a high street retail travel agency presence in England,
Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, operates the Independence Group (IG) consisting of independent travel
agents throughout the UK who operate under licence, together with homeworkers and franchise operators located
throughout the UK. In addition, the Group operates an inhouse tour operations business, Hays Tour Operations
Limited (Vista) which curates and supplies exclusive holiday products to the Group operations.

The Group's key financial and other performance indicators during the year were as follows:

30 April 2024 = 30 April 2023

Total Transaction Value (‘TTV’) * 2,548,177 2,186,057

Average number of employees 3,535 3,197

*(Total Transaction Value ‘TTV’ is defined as a non-statutory measure in the accounting policies disclosed in Note
1 fo the financial statements).

In the year to 30 April 2024, the Group generated a profit before taxation of £73.4 m in comparison to a profit of
£51.5m in the previous year to 30 April 2023. During the financial period, the business has continued to grow and
has traded strongly despite economic and political headwinds which included the cost-of-living crisis, rising
interest rates and ongoing war following the invasion of Ukraine by Russia.

The Group has acquired both The Original Travel House Limited and Just Go Travel Limited during the year which
has contributed to the growth in profit before tax. It expected that the Group can achieve significant synergies
utilising its existing operations to strengthen the performance of both businesses acquired.

The Group Total Transaction Value 'TTV' has increased to over £2.54bn in the 12 months ended 30 April 2024 as
compared to £2.19bn in the 12 months to 30 April 2023 representing an increase of 17%, evidencing the
continued confidence of customers to travel despite challenging economic conditions.

Turnover increased from £423.5m to £457.4m.

Principal risks and uncertainties
The Board meets regularly and evaluates the Group’s risk position. The principal risks and uncertainties facing
the Group are detailed below.

The Group's principal financial investments comprise cash and loans advanced to Independence Group
members. Other financial assets and liabilities, such as trade creditors and trade debtors, arise directly from the
Group's operating activities.


Hays Travel Limited
Strategic Report
Year ended 30 April 2024

The main risks associated with the Group's financial assets and liabilities are set out below,

Going Concern

The Directors have considered the Group's current and prospects and its availability of financing, our
assessments support that the Group can continue to pay its liabilities as they fall due for a period of at least 12
months from the date of approval of these financial statements. As such, the Directors continue to adopt the going
concern basis of preparation for these financial statements,

Market demand : : . :
Demand for holidays is vulnerable to general economic conditions. The Board manages capacity and the cost
base to suit the prevailing market demand and identifies new efficient routes to market to grow market share and
maintain margins. The Board has confidence in the market opportunities for its core business in the medium to
long term. Demand for holidays has remained a consumer priority despite the cost of living crisis, uncertainty in
the UK government and increase In mortgage and borrowing rates.

Regulation changes and competition

The sale of travel and holiday arrangements is a competitive and highly regulated industry. The Group seeks to
manage the associated risks by constantly monitoring changes and adapting its business model and terms of
trade as necessary.

Interest rate risk
The Group invests surplus cash in floating rate interest yielding bank deposit accounts. The Group's interest
income is therefore affected by movements in interest rates.

Credit risk
The Group has external debtors; however, the Group undertakes assessments of its customers in order to ensure
that credit is not extended where there is a likelihood of default.

Liquidity risk

The Group aims to mitigate liquidity risk by managing cash generated by its operations. Detailed cash flow
forecasts are prepared and presented to the Board on a regular basis. The Group deposits surplus funds with a
range of banks on a short and long term fixed and variable basis in line with business cash requirements. The
Group ensures that funds are placed in low risk rated accounts and actively monitors the credit rating of each of
the banks via rating agencies.

Foreign currency risk

The Group applies foreign currency matching principles to reduce foreign currency exposure. Where a sale
results in an associated extemal creditor denominated in foreign currency, the Group purchases the foreign
currency the day after the sale and holds this for future settlement to mitigate the risk of exposure to rate
fluctuations.

Other general factors

The Group is also exposed to other factors common to the majority of businesses such as the need to recruit and
Tetain suitable colleagues, an increasing reliance on computer systems and technology, and the protection of the
reputation and good name of the business. Significant adverse experience or events in relation to any of these
factors could impact upon the Group's trading performance and financial position.

Non-financial and sustainabllity information statement (Companies Act Section 414 CB)

While the group does not yet meet the threshold for UK CFD reporting, the group recognises its obligation to its
wider stakeholders and has therefore voluntarily adopted some elements for reporting in the annual report. The
Group has voluntarily disclosed key information across the four core elements of climate-related financial
disclosures in relation to governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets.


Hays Travel Limited
Strategic Report
Year ended 30 April 2024

Governance

Governance around the Group’s response to climate change, providing oversight on climate related risks and
opportunities and the assessment of progress on actions required in response is embedded within the Group’s
tisk management processes. The Board is responsible for the identification of risks and setting the strategic
objectives of the Group. The Group Finance Director, Ken Campling is the lead of our group sustainability team
and oversees the assessment and monitoring of climate related risks. Ken provides reporting to the board at
regular intervals (at least monthly) on progress towards the group's sustainability goals.

Risks

The board meets three times a week and evaluates the groups risk position atleast monthly maintaining a risk
register to record, manage and respond to risks. The board and our sustainability team focus on the identification
of these risks and develop policies and procedures to support with the mitigation of risks in the future. The key

‘tisks identified for the business are:

Physical Climate Risk

Our business is inkezently susceptible to physical risks from climate events as has been evidenced in recent
years with eaithquakes in Egypt and Morocco and a volcanic eruption in Icefand afl impacting holidays sold by
Hays Travel (including the financial impact of cancellation and additional work required to ensure our customers.
are adequately looked after). We work closely with our suppliers and our customers to ensure that we can offer
alternative destinations and protect our customers when one-off events do inevitably occur. We work closely with
our partners to ensure that customers have access to robust insurance policies that protect their financial
commitment to a Hays Travel holiday and maintain the excellent tevels of service that we always try to achieve.

The group has considered scenarios for physica! risk factors including both earthquakes and other one off climate
events in addition to more severe long term impacts of climate change such as rising sea levels and changes in
weather patterns. As an independent travel agent Hays Travel is uniquely positioned to work with a wide range of
suppliers and flex its product offering at pace providing viable alternatives to our customers if events do occur.
Our track record of supporting customers when external factors impact their holiday is considered a key strength
and sets us apart from our competitors in a changing environment.

The group sets deadlines for the addressing of risks based on the severity of the impact and ability to mitigate.

Transitional Climate Risk

In our branches we have invested significantly to mitigate the risk of a transition across the UK to renewable
energy sources and almost all Hays Travel branches are able to operate using renewable electricity only. Where
possible we encourage colleagues to reduce the use of paper and other materials. We work closely with our
partners and suppliers to ensure that sustainability is a key consideration as we continually develop our routes
and destinations to better serve our customers and their changing needs. Hays will support the travel industry as
it looks to become more sustainable in the future including through initiatives such as carbon offsetting and
innovation in sustainable aircraft fuel. The group has demonstrated its ability to adapt to changing market trends
and will continue to do so as the industry shifts to holiday products that have a greater focus on sustalnability.

The group has considered scenarios for transitional risks including; the change to a low carbon economy across
non-energy sectors and the Paris Agreement entered into by the UK government to keep the increase in average
global temperature well below 2 degrees higher than pre industrial levels. The goals of the UK government are
closely aligned with our own sustainability strategy and target of “net zero” by 2030. The adaptation of our retail
stores for low carbon energy sets us apart from our competitors and as a result the business is well positioned to
Meet upcoming changes in legislation to achieve this goal.

Strategy
The group recognises that whilst it remains a business with the primary objective of delivering long term
sustainable profit and cashflows, this will only be achieved by adding value to the communities in which we


Hays Travel Limited

Strategic Report

Year ended 30 April 2024

operate and delivering an exceptional level of service to our stakeholders. The groups values and its vision “to
become the UK's most profitable privately owned travel company, which values our people, our customers, our
partners and the communities where we operate” demonstrates our commitment to doing the right thing.

We recognise the need to support society's goal for a more sustainable future and to protect our planet,
communities and businesses for the benefit of future generations. Sustainability and supporting our communities
are key supporting pillars in our strategy on a page and are a key focus forcolleagues across the business.

Transition Statement

The group is working towards meeting requirements e, f, g and h of UK CFD and expects to report on these fully
in next years annual report. The group has, as a result, taken the exemption to report fully on these requirements
this year but included some information covered by these requirements for our stakeholders in line with our
commitment to transparent and detailed reporting even where we are not mandated to do so.

Metrics and Targets
The group has targeted “net zero” by 2030 and has taken action to help to achieve this target including the
adaptation atourretail stores to be electric only and equipped to take advantagesofenewable electricity.

\n addition, the group monitors its performance against sustainability goals under the government policy
Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting (SECR).

The key performance indicator is the intensity ratio based on group turnover and full time equivalent employees
("FTE") which the group has been able to reduce during the reporting period (refer below). The group has also
committed to voluntarily disclose scope 3 emissions to more accurately benchmark its performance in future
teporting periods and Hays Travel are committed to continuing to report further detail on our sustainability
performance to aid stakeholders in thelr decision making.

Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting (SECR)

The Group meets the qualifying conditions to report their carbon emissions and energy usage. The GHG Protocol
Corporate Standard (used to prepare these disclosures) classifies a company’s GHG emissions into three
scopes:

« Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions from owned or controlled sources

« Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions from owned or controlled sources

« Scope 3 emissions includes all other indirect emissions that occur at sources which Hays Travel Group
does not own or control.

SECR requires that all scope 1.and 2 emissions are reported and we expect that Scope 3 emissions will be
required in the future. As stated in our most recent annual report, we have widened the scope of our disclosure to
include additional voluntary Scope 3 emissions for the current year. This increases the overall emissions total.

An intensity ratio is used to determine the carbon emissions relative to a single common business metric and
allows the Group's carbon footprint to be compared over time or allow comparison with simifar organisations.

An analysis of Group's operations was completed for the reporting period running 1 May 2023 to 30 April 2024
and the total energy consumption (scope 1, 2 and 3) across all sites and activities over this period was 8,076,295
kWh.

Corresponding total emissions emitted by the Group were calculated to be 2,929.03 tCO7e (tonnes of carbon
dioxide equivalent) with an intensity ratio of 115 (Scope 1 and 2 Only: 0.67) per million £ turnover and 0.72
(Scope 4 and 2 only: 0.41) tCO7e per FTE.

The GHG emissions and energy reported are show in the table below.

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable
law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit
of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company and the Group in
accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the United
Kingdom, including the Financial Reporting Council's Ethical Standard and we have fulfilled our other ethical
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Conclusions relating to going concern

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the director's use of the going concern basis of
accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or
conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a
going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for Issue.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the director with respect to going concern are described in the
relevant sections of this report.

Other information

The Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included
in the Annual Report, other than the financial statements and our Auditor's Report thereon. Our opinion on the
financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in
our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in
doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our
knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material
inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material
misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work
we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required
to report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

12

Hays Travel Limited

Independent Auditor's Report to the Members of Hays Travel Limited
Year ended 30 April 2024

e _ the information given in the Director's Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are
prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
* — the Director's Report has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

Matters on which we are required to report by exception

In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Company and its environment obtained in the course of the
audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the Director's Report.

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006
tequires us to report to you if, in our opinion:

» adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been
received from branches not visited by us; or -

« the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or

* — certain disclosures of director's remuneration specified by law are not made; or

« we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or

Responsibilities of directors

As explained more fully in the Directors' Responsibilities Statement set out on page 11, the Directors are
responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair
view, and for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Company and Group's
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concem and using the
going concer basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Company or to cease
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an Auditor's Report that includes our
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

{rregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures
in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities,
including fraud. The specific procedures for this engagement and the extent to which these are capable of
detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed betow:

e Enquiry of management and those charged with governance around actual and potential litigation and
claims

« Enquiry of entity staff in tax and compliance functions to identify any instances of non-compliance with
laws and regulations

« Performing audit work over the risk of management override of controls, including testing of Journal
entries and other adjustments for appropriateness, evaluating the business rationale of significant
transactions outside the normal course of business and reviewing accounting estimates for bias

e Reviewing financial statement disclosures and testing to supporting documentation to assess
compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

Because of the inherent limitations of an audit, there is a risk that we will not detect all Irregularities including
those leading to material misstatement in the financial statements or non-compliance with regulation. This risk
increases the more that compliance with a law or regulation is removed from the events and transactions

13

Hays Travel Limited
Independent Auditor's Report to the Members of Hays Travel Limited

Year ended 30 April 2024

reflected the financial statements, as we will be less likely to become aware of instances of non-compliance. The
risk is also greater regarding irregularities occurring due to fraud rather than error, as fraud involves intentional
concealment, forgery, collusion, omission or misrepresentation.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial
Reporting Council's website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our Auditor's
Report. :

Use of our report

This report is made solely to the Company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company's members
those matters we are required to state to them in an Auditor's Report and for no other purpose. To the fullest
extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the
Company's members, as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Accounting policies (continued)
Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty

The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported. These estimates and judgements are continually reviewed
and are based on experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to
be reasonable under the circumstances. Significant judgements

The judgements (apart from those involving estimations) that management has made in the process of
applying the entity's accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised
in the financial statements are as follows: .

The group holds investment properties as part of its estate which are held to collect cash flows through rent
to external parties. The group is required to estimate the valuation of these properties at the balance sheet
date. On an annual basis, the directors are required to instruct an expert (either external or internal) to
estimate the valuation of investment properties based on the current market conditions.

The group recognises revenue where it acts as an Agent on a booking basis less a provision for

cancellationsortiiis. provision Is calculated based upon historical cancellation infarmation and is applied to

bookings that have been made for holidays that have not departed at the balance sheet date. There is
judgment in the percentage of provision particularly in the context of continually reducing risks after the
heightened period of risk brought about as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. The value of the cancellation
provision held as at 30 April 2024 was £7,892,000 (2023: £7,283,000)

Revenue recognition

Turnover is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the buyer.
This is driven by whether the Group has acted as an agent or a principal.

Where the Group acts as a travel agent tumover represents commission, for the sale of holidays excluding
value added tax and discounts less a provision for cancellations. Turnover is recognised at the point of
booking when the Group has met its obligations to the principal.

Where the Group acts as the principal tour operator, turnover represents the gross value of holiday
bookings excluding value added tax and discounts given to consumers. Turnover from these sales is
recognised at the point of departure. The full cost of such holidays is included within cost of sales. Turnover
for bookings made but not departed is recorded as deferred revenue on the balance sheet.

Where the Group are as a foreign currency provider, turnover represents the difference between the cost
and selling price of the currency (i.e. the margin). Foreign exchange turnover is recorded at the timing of the
sale of the currency transaction to the customer. The Group will buy back currency from customers and the
margin is recognised as turnover on the re-purchase of the foreign currency.

Where the Group provides Business Processing Services to third party organisations, revenue is
recognised following the completion of the service delivery.

Included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income is the Groups Total Transaction Value
(TTV’), a non-statutory measure. Total Transaction Value is an industry standard measure that more
accurately reflects the scale of the groups operations due to the model of revenue recognition on agency
sales. The inclusion of TTV is key to aid the understanding of the users of the financial statements including
the groups regulators, suppliers and customers.

Accounting policies (continued)
Revenue recognition (continued)

Revenue from the rendering of services is measured by reference to the stage of completion of the service
transaction at the end of the reporting period provided that the outcome can be reliably estimated. When the
outcome cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is recognised only to the extent that it is probable the
expenses recognised will be recovered.

Income tax

The taxation expense represents the aggregate amount of current and, deferred tax recognised in the
reporting period. Tax is recognised in profit or loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in
other comprehensive income or “directly i in equity. In this case, taxis recognised in other comprehensive
income or directly in equity, respectively. .

Current tax is recognised on taxabie profit for the current and past periods. Current tax is measured at the
amounts of tax expected to pay or recover using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or
substantively enacted at the reporting date.

ove wwe COT ee Se eed Gani... .
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences at the reporting date. Unrelieved tax losses
and other deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered
against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits. Deferred tax is measured using
the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date that are
expected to apply to the reversal of the timing difference.

Goodwill

Goodwill arises on business acquisitions and represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the
company's interest in the net amount of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the
acquired business.

Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. It is
amortised on a straight-line basis over its useful life. WWhere a reliable estimate of the useful life of goodwill
or intangible assets cannot be made, the life is presumed not to exceed ten years.

Intangible assets

Intangible assets are initially recorded at cost, and are subsequently stated at cost less any accumulated
amortisation and impairment losses. Any intangible assets carried al revalued amounts, are recorded at the
fair value at the date of revaluation, as determined by reference to an active market, less any subsequent
accumulated amortisation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses.

Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are only recognised separately from goodwill
when they arise from contractual or other legal rights, are separable, the expected future economic benefits -
are probable and the cost or value can be measured reliably.

Amortisation

Amortisation is calculated so as to write off the cost of an asset, less its estimated residual value, over the
useful life of that asset as follows:

Goodwill - 20% straight line
Lease Costs “ 10% straight line
Software - 20% straight line
Licences - 20% straight line

Accounting policies (continued)

Amortisation (continued)

If there is an indication that there has been a significant change in amortisation rate, useful life or residual
value of an intangible asset, the amortisation is revised prospectively to reflect the new estimates.

Tangible assets

Tangible assets are initially recorded at cost, and subsequently stated at cost less any accumulated
depreciation and impairment losses. Any tangible assets carried at revalued amounts are recorded at the
fair value at the date of revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent
accumulated impairment losses.

An increase in the carrying amount of an asset as a result of a revaluation, is recognised in other
comprehensive income and accumulated in equity, except to the extent it reverses a revaluation decrease
of the same asset previously recognised in profit or loss. A decrease in the carrying amount of an asset as a
tesult of revaluation, is recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent of any previously
recognised revaluation increase accumulated in equity in respect of that asset. Where a a revaluation
decrease exceeds the accumulated revaluation gaifié:accumulated in equity in respect of that asset, the
excess shall be recognised in profit or loss.

Investment properties held by the group are carried at fair value and changes in the fair value are recorded
in the profit and loss statement.

Depreciation

Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost or valuation of an asset, less its residual value, over the
useful economic life of that asset as follows:

Freehold Property - 4% straight line

Long leasehold property - 20% straight line
Short leasehold property - 33% straight line
Fixtures and fittings - 20% straight line
Motor vehicles - 33% straight line

Investments in subsidiaries

Fixed asset investments are initially recorded at cost, and subsequently stated at cost less any accumulated
impairment losses.

Investments In associates

Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity methad of accounting, whereby the Investment
is initially recognised at the transaction price and subsequently adjusted to reflect the group's share of the
profit or loss, other comprehensive income and equity of the associate.

Investments in joint ventures

{Investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, whereby the

investment is initially recognised at the transaction price and subsequently adjusted to reflect the group's
share of the profit or loss, other comprehensive income and equity of the joint venture.

Accounting policies (continued)
Impairment of fixed assets

A review for indicators of Impairment is carried out at each reporting date, with the recoverable amount
being estimated where such indicators exist. Where the carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount, the
asset is impaired accordingly. Prior impairments are also reviewed for possible reversal at each reporting
date.

For the purposes of impairment testing, when it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an
individual asset, an estimate is made of the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the
asset belongs. The cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that includes the asset
and generates cash inflows that largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of
assets, .

For impairment testing of goodwill, the goodwill acquired in a business combination Is, from the acquisition
date, allocated to each of the cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the
combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the company are assigned to those units.

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short term deposits
with an originat maturity date of three months or less from inception.

Trust Account

The Group operates a trust account until after the provision of the holiday service for the benefit of its
Independence Group members. Money held in the trust is for multi contract package holidays bookings by
Independence Group members. The Trust is governed by a deed between the Group, the Civil Aviation
Authority Air Travel Trustees, ABTA and independent trustees (PT Trustees Limited), which determines the
inflows and outflows 'from the account.

In August 2020, the Group established a Trust account for client monies received in advance fer EasyJet
Holidays. The Trust is governed by a cleed between the Group, Easy jet Holidays and independent trustees
(PT Trustees Limited), which determines the inflows and outflows from the account.

Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the entity has an obligation at the reporting date as a result of a past event,
It is probable that the entity will be required to transfer economic benefits in settlement and the amount of
the obligation can be estimated reliably. Provisions are recognised as a liability in the statement of financial
position and the amount of the provision as an expense.

Provisions are initially measured at the best estimate of the amount required to settle the obligation at the
teporting date and subsequently reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted to reflect the current best
estimate of the amount that would be required to settle the obligation. Any adjustments to the amounts
previously recognised are recognised in profit or loss unless the provision was originally recognised as part
of the cost of an asset. When a provision is measured at the present value of the amount expected to be
required to settle the obligation, the unwinding of the discount is recognised as a finance cost in profit or
loss in the period it arises.

Financiat instruments

A financial asset or a financial liability is recognised only when the entity becomes a party to the contractual
provisions of the instrument.

Basic financial instruments are initially recognised at the transaction price, unless the arrangement
constitutes a financing transaction, where it is recognised at the present value of the future payments
discounted at a market rate of interest for a similar debt instrument.

Debt instruments are subsequently measured at amortised cost.

Notes to the Annual Report and Financial Statements (continued)

Year ended 30 April 2024

3.

Accounting policies (continued)
Debtors and creditors due within one year are measured at amortised cost.

Financial assets that are measured at cost or amortised cost are reviewed for objexctive evidence of
impairment at the end of each reporting date. If there is objective evidence of impairment, an impairment

loss is recognised in profit or loss immediately.

Any reversals of impairment are recognised in profit or loss immediately, to the extent that the reversal does
not result in a carrying amount of the financial asset that exceeds what the carrying amount would have
been had the impairment not previously been recognised.

Defined benefit plans

The company recognises a defined net benefit pension asset or liability in the statement of financial position
as the net total of the present value of its obligations and the fair value of plan assets out of which the
obligations are to be settled. The defined benefit liability is measured on a discounted present value basis
using a rate determined by reference to market yields at the reporting date on high quality corporate bonds.
Defined benefit obligations and the related expenses are measured using the projected unit credit method.
Plan surpluses are recognised as a defined benefit asset only to the extent that the Surplus is is $ recoverable
either through reduced contributions in the future or through refunds from the plan. pit

Changes in the net defined benefit asset or liability arising from employee service are recognised in profit or
loss as a current service cost where it relates to services in the current period and as a past service cost
where it relates to services in prior periods. Costs relating to plan introductions, benefit changes,
curtailments and settlements are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they occur.

Net interest is determined by multiplying the net defined benefit liability by the discount rate, both. as
determined at the start of the reporting period, taking account of any changes in the net defined benefit

liability during the period as a result of contribution and benefit payments. Net interest is recognised in profit
or loss.

Defined contribution plans

Contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as an expense In the period in which the related
service is provided. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that the prepayment will
lead to a reduction in future payments or a.cash refund.

When contributions are not expected to be settled wholly within 12 months of the end of the reporting date
in which the employees render the related service, the liability Is measured on a discounted present value
basis. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as a finance cost in profit or loss in the period in which it
arises.

Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method.

The cost of a business combination is measured as the aggregate of the fair values, at the acquisition date,
of assets given, liabilities Incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued plus any costs directly
attributable to the business combination.

Where control is achieved in stages, the cost of the business combination is the aggregate of the fair values
of the assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued at the date of each
transaction in the series.

Where the business combination requires an adjustment to the cost contingent on future events, the
estimated amount of that adjustment is included in the cost of the combination at the acquisition date
providing it is probable and can be measured reliably. Where it is not recognised at the acquisition date but
subsequently becomes probable and can be measured reliably, the additional consideration is treated as an
adjustment to the cost of the combination. If such expected future events do not occur, or the estimate
needs to be revised, the cost of the business combination is adjusted accordingly. The unwinding of any
discounting is recognised as a finance cost in profit or loss in the period it arises.

Contingencies

The consideration paid for the purchase of The Original Travel House Limited includes an additional
variable amount which is contingent on external factors that cannot be influenced by the Group. The group
has assessed the likelihood of economic outflow based on these factors, including through review of actual
outcomes to the date of authorisation of these financial statements, and does not consider it to be probable

- or able to be reliably measured thus not meeting the threshold for recognition as a liability. As a result, no

liability has been recognised at the 30 April 2024.
