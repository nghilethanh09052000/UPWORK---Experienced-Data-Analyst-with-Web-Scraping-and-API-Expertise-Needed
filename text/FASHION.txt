REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS
FOR THE PERIOD 1 JUNE 2023 TO 29 FEBRUARY 2024

The directors present their report with the financial statements of the company for the period 1 June 2023 to 29 February 2024.
REVIEW OF BUSINESS

Following a difficult 2023 year which resulted in a loss of £277,303 I am delighted to confirm that Fashion-Enter has now generated
a surplus of £46,630 after tax as at the end of February 2024.

This has been achieved by an excellent strong team with the new Board of Directors and the continual strategic guidance of Founder
Jenny Holloway

The business has pivoted to new sustainable manufacturing practices which includes repairs, alterations and recommerce as well as
decreasing our reliance on core production runs.

The success of the Fashion Technology Academy continues and has now reached a 500% increase in turnover over the last three
years. The demand for technical skills is stronger than ever and we are delighted to confirm that a major £800k program has been
announced in Wales for our Fashion Technology Academy in partnership with the NPTC Group of Colleges. The expected launch
will be June 2024 in Powys Wales.

New partnerships have been created with outstanding companies such as United Repair Centre and Style3D. We expect substantial
growth in these new areas for 2024/25

We would like to acknowledge our clients, learners, suppliers and the staff of Fashion-Enter Ltd for their strong support. We now
enter our year 19 with a lean efficient company that is ready for growth.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE PERIOD 1 JUNE 2023 TO 29 FEBRUARY 2024

STATUTORY INFORMATION

Fashion - Enter Ltd is a private company, limited by guarantee , registered in England and Wales. The company’s registered
number and registered office address can be found on the Company Information page.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of preparing the financial statements

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102 "The Financial
Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland” including the provisions of Section 1A "Small Entities"
and the Companies Act 2006. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.

Turnover
Turnover is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, excluding discounts, rebates, value added
tax and other sales taxes.

Intangible assets
Intangible assets are initially measured at cost. After initial recognition, intangible assets are measured at cost less any

accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.

Trademarks and patents are being amortised evenly over their estimated useful life of two years.

Tangible fixed assets

Depreciation is provided at the following annual rates in order to write off each asset over its estimated useful life.
Short leasehold - in accordance with the property

Fixtures and fittings - 25% on cost

Stocks

Stocks and work in progress are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value, after making due allowance for obsolete
and slow moving items.

Cost is calculated using the first-in, first-out method and includes all purchase, transport, and handling costs in bringing
stocks to their present location and condition.

Taxation
Taxation for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Income Statement, except to the extent
that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.

Current or deferred taxation assets and liabilities are not discounted.

Current tax is recognised at the amount of tax payable using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the balance sheet date.

Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date.

Timing differences arise from the inclusion of income and expenses in tax assessments in periods different from those in
which they are recognised in financial statements. Deferred tax is measured using tax rates and laws that have been enacted
or substantively enacted by the period end and that are expected to apply to the reversal of the timing difference.

Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that they will be
recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.
