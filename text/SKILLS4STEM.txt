Accounting policies
Company information
Skills4Stem Limited is a
private
company
limited by shares
incorporated in
England and Wales
.
The registered office is
Bedford I Lab, Stannard Way, Priory Business Park, Bedford, Bedfordshire, MK44 3RZ.
1.1
Accounting convention
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 102 “The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland” (“FRS 102”) and the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies subject to the small companies regime. The disclosure requirements of section 1A of FRS 102 have been applied other than where additional disclosure is required to show a true and fair view.
The financial statements are prepared in
sterling
, which is the functional currency of the company.
Monetary a
mounts
in these financial statements are
rounded to the nearest £.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
1.2
Turnover
Turnover
is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and the rendering of services in the normal course of business, and is shown net of discounts and VAT.
Rendering of services
Revenue arises from the provision of training services.
Revenue is recognised proportionally over the performance of the service contract, by reference to the stage of completion of the transaction at the end of the reporting period.
1.3
Intangible fixed assets other than goodwill
Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are recognised at cost and are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over their useful lives on the following bases:
Website
6 years straight line
Other intangibles
3 years straight line
1.4
Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets
are initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost or valuation, net of depreciation and any impairment losses.
Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over their useful lives on the following bases:
Plant and equipment
25% reducing balance
Computers
25% reducing balance
The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying value of the asset, and
is credited or charged to profit or loss
.
1.5
Stocks
Stocks
represent "end point" assessment fees, incurred prior to completion of the courses funded by the government and
are stated at the lower of cost and
net realisable value.

1.6
Financial instruments
The company has elected to apply the provisions of Section 11 ”Basic Financial Instruments” to all of its financial instruments.
Financial instruments are recognised in the company’s balance sheet when the company becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Basic financial assets
Short term debtors are measured at transaction price less any provision for impairment. Loans receivable are measured initially at fair value, net of transaction costs and are subsequently carried at amortised costs using the effective interest method, less any provision for impairment.
Basic financial liabilities
Short term creditors are measured at transaction price.
Other financial liabilities, including bank loans and other loans, are measured initially at fair value, net of transaction costs and are subsequently carried at amortised costs using the effective interest method.
1.7
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable
and deferred tax.
Current tax
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the
profit and loss account
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The
company’s
liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting end date.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all timing differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting end date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the
profit and loss account.
1.8
Employee benefits
The costs of short-term employee benefits are recognised as a liability and an expense, unless those costs are required to be recognised as part of the cost of stock or
fixed assets
.
1.9
Retirement benefits
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
1.10
Leases
Rentals payable under operating leases,
including
any lease incentives received, are charged to
profit or loss
on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease except where another more systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the lease
s
asset are consumed.
