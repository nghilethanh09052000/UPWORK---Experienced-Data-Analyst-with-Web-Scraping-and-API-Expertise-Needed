NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

For the Year Ended 31 December 2023
STATUTORY INFORMATION

Competence Development Limited is a private company, limited by shares, registered in England and Wales. The company’s registered
number and registered office address can be found on the Company Information page.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of preparing the financial statements

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the provisions of Section 1A “Small Entities” of Financial Reporting
Standard 102 “The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of ireland” and the Companies Act 2006. The financial
statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.

Revenue
Turnover is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable in respect of services provided. Revenue is recognised
on a straight line basis over the duration of the contract with the education provider.

Intangible fixed assets
Amortisation of intangible fixed assets only commences when the relevant development is commercially ready for sale. Only those costs

which relate directly to the development of commercially viable software are held as intangible fixed assets.

Amortisation is provided at the following annual rates in order to write off the cost less estimated residual value of intangible assets over
the estimated useful life:

Software development — 20% on cost
Intangible fixed assets are stated at cost less amortisation

Tangible fixed assets
Depreciation is provided at the following annual rates in order to write off the cost less estimated residual value of each asset over its

estimated useful life.

Improvements to property — 10% on cost
Office equipment — 33% on cost

Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less depreciation.

teasing commitments
Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.

impairment of assets

At each reporting date assets are reviewed to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment
loss. If there is an indication of possible impairment, the recoverable amount of any affected asset is estimated and compared with its
carrying amount. If the estimated recoverable amount is lower the carrying amount is reduced to its estimated recoverable amount and

an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.

Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable
amount, to the extent that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined {net of
depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in its prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as
income immediately.
