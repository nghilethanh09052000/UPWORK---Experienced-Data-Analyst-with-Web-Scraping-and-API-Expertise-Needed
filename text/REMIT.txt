Strategic Report
For the year ended 31 December 2023
Page 1
The directors present the strategic report for the year ended 31 December 2023.
Fair review of the business
Remit Group (“Remit”) is a subsidiary of Remit Holdings Limited and is a national multi-sector training provider, providing structured apprenticeships and commercial training across the UK, funded by the Government through the Education and Skills Funding Agency (“ESFA”), Skills Development Scotland, the Welsh Assembly Government, the apprenticeship levy and from commercial programmes provided to Remit’s customers.
From its heritage in the motor industry, Remit has expanded into information technology, food retail, food manufacturing, hospitality, leadership and management, customer service and business administration
although automotive training remains Remit's largest market sector
. Remit works closely with large employers to design and deliver tailored training programmes, both Government funded and commercially funded, and ensuring employers are fully involved in the planning of learning and the reviewing of progress to meet their specific needs and work requirements.
Remit is passionate about
involving
employer
s in
apprenticeship training and works closely with employers to design and deliver effective and innovative apprenticeship programmes which provide employers with a return
on
their
investment. Remit also works closely with industry bodies including AELP (the Association of Employers and Learning Providers) to ensure training is relevant
,
effective
and in line with government policy.
Principal risks and uncertainties
The Directors consider that the principal risks to the business relate to changes in Government policy in the use and level of Apprenticeships and their funding bands.
Remit’s spread of clients from HGV manufacturers and food manufacturers to food retailers and IT businesses, help
s to
mitigate
any
overall revenue impact.
Remit has further sought to mitigate any risk by expanding its commercial training revenues.
Inflationary pressures and the
continuing
failure of many funding bands to keep pace with inflation to date,
are key business issues, although funding for the Heavy Vehicle and Maintenance Technician standard has now been increased, albeit after the balance sheet date.
In determining the appropriate basis of preparation of the financial statements, the directors are required to consider whether the group and company can continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, being a minimum period of 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements.
The group and the company's activities are impacted largely as a result of the Government failing to keep apprenticeship funding in line with inflation, meaning the funding available has not reflected the higher operating costs being incurred by training providers. Management has considered the group and the company's financial performance since the balance sheet date, and the likely ongoing impact on revenues and profitability as a result of this. Management has prepared forecasts and cash flow projections up to 31 December 2025. Based on these, and post-year-end results, the directors are confident that the group and the Company will have sufficient resources to settle their liabilities as they fall due and to continue to operate for at least the next twelve months from the date these financial statements are approved. The financial statements have therefore been prepared on a going concern basis.
Financial risk management
The company's operations expose it to financial risks that include liquidity and cash flow risk which the directors monitor on a regular basis through cash flow modelling and forecasting.

Strategic Report (Continued)

Strategic Management
Led by Sue Pittock OBE, Chief Executive, the Remit management team has extensive experience in the education and training sector and continued to progress
throughout
2023
. New processes
and academies continue to be introduced to the business, enhancing the performance of the business and the client and learner experience. The Remit business now has four automotive academies in England and Scotland and
planning is well underway
to open a fifth shortly to continue to meet customer demand
.
The management team is well supported by the Remit board which includes Sarah Sillars OBE (former Chief Executive and Executive Chair of the IMI).
In 2023,
Remit received a Grade 1 Outstanding inspection report from Ofsted, which is testament to the very high quality of Remit’s provision, its outstanding programmes and excellent management. This Outstanding grade means that Remit is in the top 1% of training providers in the country and management consider that it provides an excellent platform from which the business can grow its client base materially.
Remit has also recently been awarded the Platinum standard by Investors in People, which is testament to Remit's people management, reward and culture.
Business Performance and Key performance indicators
In the financial year under review, Remit Group achieved consolidated sales of £16,081,
441
,
9%
down on the previous year’s performance, largely due to Remit’s decision to focus only on Apprenticeships and Commercial Training and no other Government funded programs.
However,
it is pleasing
to report that the group achieved a profit before taxation of £256,236, a 34% increase on the previous year.
After the balance sheet date, in March 2024, Remit Group Limited was awarded and received £987,000 as an exceptional payment from the Department of Education to invest in, sustain and expand capacity for training in the Heavy Vehicle and Maintenance Technician standard. Funding for that standard has also now increased.
The group has cash balances available of £982,965 for working capital management
Business Strategy
Remit has diversified over the years to provide training services in a number of different sectors including
in particular
automotive (heavy goods vehicle and light vehicle) digital, food retail, food manufacturing, hospitality, leadership and management, customer service and business administration.
The business strategy is to continue to grow organically in Remit’s current sectors
and
generate commercial income streams to run alongside existing Government income streams.
Remit’s commercial offering now includes Electric Vehicle, ADAS, Hydrogen, and Advanced Electrics training to name a few, delivered in either of Remit’s specialist training facilities in Derby and Scotland
. Remit also has
the capability to deliver across the country in clients' premises if they require this solution.
This commercial training division was established to meet significant sector demand w
h
ere apprenticeships
were not the required fit to upskill existing technicians. Remit works with some excellent employer brands, and
since receiving its Ofsted Outstanding Grade, has continued to expand its reach with more major brands.

The directors present their annual report and financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023.
Principal activities
Remit Group is a national multi-sector training provider, offering structured apprenticeships and adult learning across the UK, predominantly funded by the Government through the Education and Skills Funding Agency (“ESFA”), Skills Development Scotland and the Welsh Assembly Government. Remit’s provision is targeted at learners in the 16-24 age group in addition to adult learners.
Remit Group Limited owns 100% of Assessed Education Limited, an End Point Assessment Organisation.
The financial statements have been consolidated to include this trading subsidiary.
Directors
The directors who held office during the year and up to the date of signature of the financial statements were as follows:
Rob Foulston
Susan Pittock
Sarah Sillars
Paul Thompson
Diane Herft
Results and dividends
The results for the year are set out on Page 10.
No ordinary dividends were paid. The directors do not recommend payment of a final dividend.
Disabled persons
Applications for employment by disabled persons are always fully considered, bearing in mind the aptitudes of the applicant concerned. In the event of members of staff becoming disabled, every effort is made to ensure that their employment within the group continues and that the appropriate training is arranged. It is the policy of the group that the training, career development and promotion of disabled persons should, as far as possible, be identical to that of other employees.
Employee involvement
The group's policy is to consult and discuss with employees, through staff groups and at meetings, matters likely to affect employees' interests.
Information about matters of concern to employees is given through information bulletins and reports which seek to achieve a common awareness on the part of all employees of the financial and economic factors affecting the group's performance.
There is no employee share scheme at present, but the directors are considering the introduction of such a scheme as a means of further encouraging the involvement of employees in the company's performance.
Future developments
In accordance with section 414C(11) of the Companies Act 2006 the information relating to future developments and financial risk management is included in the Strategic Report.

Remit Group Limited
Directors' Responsibilities Statement
For the year ended 31 December 2023
Page 5
The directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic Report, Directors' Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year.
Under that law the directors have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice including Financial Reporting Standard 102, 'The Financial Reporting Standard Applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland' (FRS 102).
Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the group and of the company and of the profit or loss of the group for that period.
In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the
company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the group and the company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the group and of the company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Remit Group Limited
Independent Auditor's Report
To the Members of Remit Group Limited
Page 6
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Remit Group Limited
(the 'parent company') and its subsidiaries (the 'group')
for the year ended
31 December 2023 which comprise the Consolidated Profit and Loss Account, the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Company Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, the Company Statement of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies
. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 102
The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
In our opinion the financial statements:
give a true and fair view of the state of the group's and the parent company's affairs as at 31 December 2023 and of the group's profit for the year then ended;
have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the
Auditor's
responsibilities for the audit of the
financial statements
section of our report. We are independent of the
group and
parent company
in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the
financial statements
in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard
, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Conclusions relating to going concern
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors'
use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.
Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the
group or parent
company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.
Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the
directors
with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report.
Other information
The other information comprises the information included in the annual report other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.

Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of our audit
:
the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors'
R
eport for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements
; and
the Strategic Report and the Directors' Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the
group and the parent
company and
their
environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identifie
d
material misstatements in the Strategic Report or the Directors'
R
eport
.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
certain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or
we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the Directors'
R
esponsibilities
S
tatement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of
financial statements
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the
financial statements
, the
directors are
responsible for assessing the
group's and
parent
company
'
s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or parent company or to cease operations, or have
no realistic alternative but to do so.
Remit Group Limited
Independent Auditor's Report (Continued)
To the Members of Remit Group Limited
Page 8
Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements
as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with
ISAs (UK)
will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these
financial statements
.
As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs (UK) we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purposes of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the group’s internal control.
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors.
Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the group’s or the parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the group or the parent company to cease to continue as a going concern.
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
Remit Group Limited
Independent Auditor's Report (Continued)
To the Members of Remit Group Limited

Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud
Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below
.
The objectives of our audit in respect of fraud, are; to identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements due to fraud; to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the assessed risks of material misstatement due to fraud, through designing and implementing appropriate responses to those assessed risks; and to respond appropriately to instances of fraud or suspected fraud identified during the audit. However, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both management and those charged with governance of the group and parent company.
Our approach was as follows:
We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory requirements applicable to the company and considered that the most significant are the Companies Act 2006, UK financial reporting standards as issued by the Financial Reporting Council, and UK taxation legislation.
We obtained an understanding of how the group and parent company comply with these requirements by discussions with management and those charged with governance.
We assessed the risk of material misstatement of the financial statements, including the risk of material misstatement due to fraud and how it might occur, by holding discussions with management and those charged with governance.
We inquired of management and those charged with governance as to any known instances of non-compliance or suspected non-compliance with laws and regulations.
Based on this understanding, we designed specific appropriate audit procedures to identify instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. This included making enquiries of management and those charged with governance and obtaining additional corroborative evidence as required.
There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above. We are less likely to become aware of instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations that are not closely related to events and transactions reflected in the financial statements. Also, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion.
Use of our report
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken
for no purpose other than to draw to the attention of
the company’s members those matters we are required to
include
in an auditor's report
addressed to them
. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to any
party
other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Company information
Remit Group Limited
(“the Company”)
is a
private
company
limited by shares
which is domiciled and
incorporated in
England and Wales
.
The registered office is
4 Orchard Place, Nottingham Business Park, Nottingham, NG8 6PX.
1.1
Accounting convention
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 102 “The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland” (“FRS 102”) and the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
The financial statements are prepared in
sterling
, which is the functional currency of the company.
Monetary a
mounts
in these financial statements are
rounded to the nearest £.
The group and individual financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost convention. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
1.2
Exemptions for qualifying entities under FRS 102
FRS 102 allows a qualifying entity certain disclosure exemptions.
The company has taken advantage of the following exemptions:
(i) from preparing a statement of cash flows, on the basis that it is a qualifying entity and the
consolidated statement of cash flows, included in these financial statements, includes the Company's
cash flows;
(ii) from disclosing the parent company's key management personnel compensation as required by FRS102 paragraph 33.7.
1.3
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated
financial statements
incorporate those of Remit Group Limited and all of its subsidiaries (ie entities that the
g
roup controls through its power to govern the financial and operating policies so as to obtain economic benefits).
Subsidiaries acquired during the year are consolidated using the purchase method.
Subsidiary company
results are incorporated from
or up to
the date that control passes.
All
financial statements
are made up to 31 December 2023
.
All intra-group transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies are eliminated on consolidation. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.

1.4
Going concern
In determining the appropriate basis of preparation of the financial statements, the directors are required to consider whether the group and  company can continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, being a minimum period of 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements.
The directors and management have considered the group and company’s financial performance since the balance sheet date and have prepared forecasts and cash flow projections up to 31 December
202
5.
The directors are confident that the group and the company will have sufficient cash resources to continue to operate and meet their liabilities as they fall due for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of these financial statements and consequently the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
1.5
Revenue recognition
Turnover
is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts
and
VAT
.
Training revenue is recognised at the point at which the training takes place and has been evidenced. Any amounts received in the current financial year that relate to the following year are treated as deferred income at the balance sheet date.
1.6
Intangible fixed assets - goodwill
Purchased goodwill is determined by comparing the amount paid on the acquisition of a business and the aggregate fair value of its separable net assets. It is capitalised and written off on a straight line basis over its estimated useful economic life of five years, subject to impairment reviews.
1.7
Intangible fixed assets
Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are recognised at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Staff costs relating to time spent developing new content including the instructional design required to deliver the apprenticeship training courses are recognised as intangible assets - course materials.
Amortisation is recognised so as to write off the cost of assets less
their
residual values over their useful lives on the following bas
i
s:
Course Materials
3 years straight line or over the period for which the content is expected to be used if shorter
Amortisation of course materials is charged to cost of sales in the Profit and Loss account.

1.8
Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets
are
stated
at cost
less accumulated
depreciation and
accumulated
impairment losses.
Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost less
the
estimated residual value of each asset over its expected useful life, as follows:
Short leasehold property
Over the term of the lease to the break date
Fixtures, fittings & equipment
3 to 7 years
Computer equipment
3 years
The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying value of the asset, and is recognised in the
profit and loss account.
1.9
Fixed asset investments
Equity in
vest
ments are measured at fair value through profit or loss
,
except for those equity investments that are not publicly traded and whose fair value cannot otherwise be measured reliably
,
which are recognised at cost less impairment until a reliable measure of fair value becomes available.
I
n the parent company
financial statements,
investments in subsidiaries, associates and jointly controlled entities are initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the
group. Control is
the power to govern the financial and operating policies of
the
entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
1.10
Impairment of fixed assets
At each reporting
period
end date, the
group
reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible
and intangible
assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the
company
estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
The carrying amount of the investments accounted for using the equity method is tested for impairment as a single asset.
Any goodwill included in the carrying amount of the investment is not tested separately for impairment.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment annually, and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.

The r
ecoverable amount is the higher of fair value
of the asset
less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Recognised impairment losses are reversed if, and only if, the reasons for the impairment loss have ceased to apply. Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit)
in
prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
1.11
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities.
1.12
Financial instruments
Basic financial instruments are measured at amortised cost. The group and company have no other financial instruments or basic financial instruments measured at fair value.
1.13
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Dividends payable on equity instruments are recognised as liabilities once they are no longer at the discretion of the company.
1.14
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Current tax
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the
profit and loss account
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The
group’s
liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting end date.

Page 20
Deferred tax
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all timing differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the timing difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting end date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the
profit and loss account
, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the
group and company have
a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority.
1.15
Employee benefits
The costs of short-term employee benefits are recognised as a liability and an expense
.
The cost of any unused holiday entitlement is recognised in the period in which the employee’s services are received.
Termination benefits are recognised immediately as an expense when the
group and
company
are
demonstrably committed to terminate the employment of an employee or to provide termination benefits.
1.16
Retirement benefits
The group operates a defined contribution plan for its employees. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The assets of the plan are held separately from the group in independently administered funds.
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
1.17
Leases
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessees. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets at the lower of the assets fair
value at the date of inception and the present value of the minimum lease payments. The related liability is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are treated as consisting of capital and interest elements. The interest is charged to profit or loss
so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Rentals payable under operating leases,
including
any lease incentives received, are charged to
profit or loss
on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease except where another more systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the lease
d
asset are consumed.

Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the group’s accounting policies, the directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised where the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods where the revision affects both current and future periods.
Key accounting estimates and assumptions
The estimates and assumptions which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount assets and liabilities are as follows:
Intangible assets- capitalisation and amortisation of course material
The group employs staff to develop new course content including the instructional design required to deliver apprenticeship training courses. The cost of time spent by these employees, based on time records maintained, is recognised as an intangible asset described as course materials.
The total amount capitalised in the year was £
4
87,176
as shown in note
10
.
The course material is amortised over the shorter of the time that the content is expected to remain relevant and used in course delivery without significant enhancement or three years. The amortisation in the year was £342
