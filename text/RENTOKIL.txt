‘STRATEGIC REPORT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023

Introduction

The Directors present their strategic report together with the audited financial statements for the year ended 31
December 2023.

Business review
The results for the year are set out in the Statement of Comprehensive Income on page 8.

During the year the Company made a profit after tax of £73,650k (2022: £13,771k) resulting largely from interest
receivable and income from other fixed-assets investments. The Company has net assets of £1,868,318k (2022:
£1,794, 453k), and has net current assets of £677,420k (2022: £545,150k). The Directors are satisfied that the
Company is a going concem and has sufficient funds to meet its liabilities through funding if required from its
immediate parent Rentokil Initial 1927 plc.

Principal risks and uncertainties

The Directors of Rentokil Initial ple (“the Group”) manage the risks at a Group ‘evel, rather than at an individual
business unit level. For this reason, the Company's directors believe that a discussion of the Group’s risks would
not support an understanding of the development, performance or position of the Company's business. The
principal risks and uncertainties of the Group, which include those of the Company, are discussed in the Group's
2023 Annual Report which does not form part of this report.

RENTOKIL INITIAL (1896) LIMITED

STRATEGIC REPORT (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023

Directors’ statement of compliance with duty to promote the success of the Company

Section 172(1) of the Companies Act 2006 ("section 172”) requires a director of a company to act in the way he
or she considers, in good faith, would most likely promote the success of the company for the benefit of its
members as a whole.but having regard to a range of different matters including wider stakeholders. in
discharging their section 172 duties the Directors of the Company do this, although at times some factors may
have been more relevant than others, and the interests of some stakeholders will have been more relevant than
others.

{n addition, the Directors also have regard to other factors which they consider relevant to the decision being
mada. Whilst the Directors of the Company retain responsibility for the operations and interests of the Company,
those factors, include for example the interests of the wider Rentokil tnitial Group under the Company's ultimate
parent company Rentokil Initial plc, and the Company's relationship with its lenders. By considering the
Company's purpose, vision and values together with its strategic priorities (which are aligned with those of the
Rentokil Initial Group as a whole) and having a process in place for decision-making, the Directors aim to make
sure that their decisions are consistent and appropriate in all circumstances, including with regards to the wider
matters contemplated under section 172.

Authority for day-to-day management of the Company is delegated to executives who then engage
management in setting, approving and overseeing execution of the business strategy and related policies.
Board meetings are held as required where the Directors consider the Company's activities and make
decisions, as appropriate. As a part of those meetings the Directors, where relevant, receive information on
section 172 matters when making decisions. Principal decisions taken during 2023 include capital allocation,
funding (including inter-company arrangements and funding of the Company's subsidiaries), and the 2022
Annual Report and financial statements. tn making such decisions, the Directors of the Company considered a
range of factors. For example, when reviewing financing options, factors included the long-term viability of the
Campany; its expected cash flow and financing requirements; the ongoing need for strategic investment in the
business; the expected funding needs of the Company's subsidiaries and the supply of long-term equity capital
to the Company. .

As the principal activity of the Company is to act as an investment holding company for other entities in the
Rentokil Initial Group, the Company has had limited commercial business during the year. Further information
on the Company's engagement with its employees, customers and suppliers can be found in the Directors’
Report.

This report was approved by the Board of Directors, and signed on its behalf:

to continue as a going concem,

Our responsibilitles and the responsibilitias of the directors with respect to going concer are described in the relevant sections of

aiso responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are

Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives ara to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that Includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a
high tevel of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or In the
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial
statements. .

(regularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our
responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our
procedures are capable of detecting Irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below.

Based on our understanding of the company and industry, we Identified that the principal risks of non-compliance with laws and
regulations related to adherence to data protection requirements, and we considered the extent to which non-compliance might
have a material effect on the financial statements. We also considered those laws and regulations that have a direct impact on the
financial statements such as Companies Act 2006. We evaluated management's incentives and opportunities far fraudulent
manipulation of the financial statements (including the risk of override of controls), and determined that the principal risks were
related to the posting of Inappropriate journal entries to maniputate the financial performance of the Company. Audit procedures
performed by the engagement team included:

¢ Discussions with management, Intema! Audit and the Company's legal counsel, Including consideration of known or
suspected Instances of non-compliance with laws and regulation and fraud;

e Reviewing financial statement disclosures and testing to supporting documentation.

There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above. We are tess likely to become aware of instances of non-
compliance with laws and regulations that are not closely related to events and transactions reflected in the financial statements.

6

RENTOKIL INITIAL (1896) LIMITED

Also, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud Is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error,
as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentlonal misrepresentations, or through collusion.

Materia! accounting policies (continued)

¢) Going concern

Considering net assets of £1,868,318k net current assets of £677,420k as at 31 December 2023,
and a profit for the year then ended of £73,650k, the financial statements have been prepared on a
going concer basis, the Directors consider this to be appropriate for the following reasons:

The Company will have sufficient funds, through funding if required from its immediate parent
Rentokil Initial 1927 plc, to meet its liabilities as they fall due for at least 12 months from the date of
the directors’ approval of these financial statements. At present, the Company holds net receivable
amounts with its fellow subsidiaries.

Rentokil Initial 1927 plc has indicated its intention to continue to make available such funds as are
needed by the Company for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the approval of these
financial statements.

The ability of Rentokil Initial 1927 plc to continue as a going concern is itself supported by the
Group's ultimate parent company, Rentokil Initlal plc, providing financial support to Rentokil Initial
1927 plc, Rentokil Initial plc has indicated its intention to continue to make available such funds as ~
are needed by Rentokil Initial 1927 pic for a period of at least 12 months from the directors’ approval
of these financial statements.

Consequently, the directors are confident that the Company will have sufficient funds to continue to
meet its liabilities as they fall due for at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial
statements and therefore have prepared the financial statements on a going concern basis.

Interest income

Interest income is recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method.

Finance costs

Finance costs are charged to profit or loss over the term of the debt using the effective intérest method
so that the amount charged is at a constant rate on the carrying amount. Issue costs are initially
recognised as a reduction in the proceeds of the associated capital instrument.

Borrowing costs

All borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the year in which they are incurred.

Current and deferred taxation

The tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in profit or loss
except that a charge attributable to an item of income and expense recognised as other
comprehensive income or to an item recognised directly in equity is also recognised in other
comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively. :

The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of tax rates and laws that have been enacted
or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date in the countries where the Company operates and
generates income. -

i)

Current and deferred taxation (continued)

Deferred tax balances are recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but
Not reversed by the Balance Sheet date, except that:

° The recognition of deferred tax assets is limited to the extent that it is probable that they will
be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits; and

. Any deferred tax balances are reversed if and when all conditions for retaining associated tax
allowances have been met.

Deferred tax balances are not recognised In respect of permanent differences except in respect of
business combinations, when deferred tax is recognised on the differences between the fair values of
assets acquired and the future tax deductions available for them and the differences between the fair
values of liabilities acquired and the amount that will be assessed for tax. Deferred tax is determined
using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.

Vatuation of investments

Investments in subsidiaries are measured at cost less accumulated impairment. An impairment loss is
recognised for the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The
recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's (or CGU's) fair value less costs to sell, and value-in-
use.

Debtors

Short term debtors are measured at transaction price, less any impairment. Loans to group
undertakings are measured initially at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are measured
subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment.

interest-free intragroup loans are repayable on demand and accordingly are recognised as due within
one year. Interest-bearing loans are recognised as follows: with a maturity date within 12 months of
the balance sheet date, recognised as current; with a maturity date over 3 years from the balance
sheet date, recognised as fixed assets; with a maturity between 12 months and 3 years from the
balance sheet date, recognised as current debtors falling due after more than one year.

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash is represented by cash in hand and deposits with financial institutions repayable without penalty
on notice of not more than 24 hours. Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments that mature in no
more than three months from the date of acquisition and that are readily convertible to known amounts
of cash with insignificant risk of change in value.

Creditors

Creditors are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course
of business from suppliers.

Créditors are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortisad cost using the
effective interest method.

obligation that probably requires settlement by a transfer of economic benefit, and a reliable estimate
can be made of the amount of the obligation.

Provisions are charged as an expense to profit or loss in the year that the Company becomes aware
of the obligation, and are measured at the best estimate at the Balance Sheet date of the expenditure
required to settle the obligation, taking into account relevant risks and uncertainties.

When payments are eventually made, they are charged to the provision carried in the Balance Sheet.
Financial instruments

The Company recognises financial instruments when it becomes a party to the contractual
arrangements of the instrument. Financial instruments are de-recognised when they are discharged
or when the contractual terms expire. The Company's accounting policies in respect of financial
instruments transactions are explained below:

Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value.
Financial assets

All recognised financial assets are subsequently measured in their entirety at either fair value or
amortised cost, depending on the classification of the financial assets.

Debt instruments at amortised cost

Debt instruments are subsequently measured at amortised cost where they are financial assets held
within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash
flows and selling the financial assets, and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on
specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount
outstanding. Amortised cost is calculated using the effective interest method and represents the
amount measured at Initial recognition less repayments of principal plus the cumulative amortisation
using the effective interest method of any difference between the initial amount and the maturity
amount, adjusted for any loss allowance.

Impairment of financial assets

The Company always recognises lifetime expected credit losses (ECLs) for debtors, fixed asset loans,
and amounts due on contracts with customers. The ECLs on these financial assets are estimated
based on the Company's historical credit loss experience, adjusted for factors that are specific to the
debtors, general economic conditions and an assessment of both the current as well as the forecast
direction of conditions at the reporting date, including time value of money where appropriate. Lifatine
ECL represents the expected credit losses that will resuit from all possible default events over
the expected life of a financial instrument. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which
the asset's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of
an asset's (or CGU's) fair value less costs to self and value in use.

Material accounting policies (continued)
m) Financial Instruments (continued)

Financial liabilities
At amortised cost

Financial liabilities which are neither contingent consideration of an acquirer in a business
combination, held for trading, nor designated as at fair value through profit or loss are subsequently
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. This is a method of calculating the
amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period. The
effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the
expected life of the financial liability, or where appropriate a shorter period, to the. amortised cost of a
financial flability.

n) Foreign Currency Translation

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates
prevailing at the dates of the transactions or valuation where items are remeasured.

Judgements in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty

The Company makes certain estimates and assumptions regarding the future. Estimates and judgements
are continually evaluated based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future
events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. In the future, actual experience may
differ from these estimates and assumptions. While not considered a critical estimate, as there is not a
significant risk of material adjustment in the next 12 months, the following involves certain levels of
estimation uncertainty.

(a) Impairment of investments

The Company is required to test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
their carrying amount may not be recoverable. The recoverable amount is determined based on value in
use calculations. The use of this method requires the estimation of future cash flows and the choice of a
discount rate in order to calculate the present vaiue of the cash flows. An impairment trigger assessment
was carried out in 2023 and no triggers were identified.
