Accounting policies

Company information
Kiwi & Yuzu Ltd is a private company limited by shares incorporated in England and Wales. The registered office is
Tagus House, 9 Ocean Way, Southampton, Hampshire, United Kingdom, $014 3TJ.

Accounting convention

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 102 “The Financial Reporting Standard
applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland” (“FRS 102") and the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 as
applicable to companies subject to the small companies regime. The disclosure requirements of section 1A of FRS 102
have been applied other than where additional disclosure is required to show a true and fair view.

The financial statements are prepared in sterling, which is the functional currency of the company. Monetary amounts
in these financial statements are rounded to the nearest £.

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention. The principal accounting policies
adopted are set out below.

Turnover

Turnover is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods and services provided in
the normal course of business, and is shown net of VAT and other sales related taxes. The fair value of consideration
takes into account trade discounts, settlement discounts and volume rebates.

Training services
Revenue from professional services in relation to training fees are recognised on a receipt basis.

Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost or valuation, net of depreciation
and any impairment losses.

Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over their useful
lives on the following bases:

Leasehold improvements 20% Straight line
Plant and machinery 25% Reducing balance
Fixtures, fittings & equipment 15% Reducing balance
Computer equipment 33% Straight line
Motor vehicles 25% Reducing balance

The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the sale proceeds and the
carrying value of the asset, and is credited or charged to profit or loss.

Fixed asset investments

Interests in subsidiaries, associates and jointly controlled entities are initially measured at cost and subsequently
measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. The investments are assessed for impairment at each
reporting date and any impairment losses or reversals of impairment losses are recognised immediately in profit or loss

A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the company. Control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies
of the entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.

Accounting policies (Continued)

An associate is an entity, being neither a subsidiary nor a joint venture, in which the company holds a long-term interest
and where the company has significant influence. The company considers that it has significant influence where it has
the power to participate in the financial and operating decisions of the associate.

Entities in which the company has a long term interest and shares control under a contractual arrangement are
classified as jointly controlled entities.

Impairment of fixed assets
At each reporting period end date, the company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible assets. A provision is
made for any impairment loss and taken to the profit and loss account.

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents are basic financial assets and include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other
short-term liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are
shown within borrowings in current liabilities.

Financial instruments
The company only enters into Basic financial instrument transactions.

Financial instruments are recognised in the company's balance sheet when the company becomes party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument.

Financial assets and liabilities are offset, with the net amounts presented in the financial statements, when there is a
legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to realise
the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Basic financial assets

Basic financial assets, which include debtors and cash and bank balances, are initially measured at transaction price
including transaction costs and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method unless
the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where the transaction is measured at the present value of the
future receipts discounted at a market rate of interest.

Classification of financial liabilities

Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements
entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the company after
deducting all of its liabilities.

Basic financial liabilities

Basic financial liabilities, including creditors, bank loans, loans from fellow group companies and preference shares that
are classified as debt, are initially recognised at transaction price unless the arrangement constitutes a financing
transaction, where the debt instrument is measured at the present value of the future payments discounted at a market
rate of interest.

Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of transaction costs. Dividends
payable on equity instruments are recognised as liabilities ance they are no longer at the discretion of the company.

Accounting policies (Continued)

Derivatives

Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently
remeasured to fair value at each reporting end date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss
immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the
recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.

A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a financial asset, whereas a derivative with a negative fair value
is recognised as a financial liability.

Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.

Current tax
The current tax liability is recognised for the tax payable on the taxable profit of the current and past periods. A current
tax asset is recognised in respect of a tax loss that can be carried back to recover tax paid in a previous period.

Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences between the recognition of income and expenses in the
financial statements and their inclusion in the tax assessments.

Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that they will be
recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.

The company's liability for current and deferred tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the reporting end date.

Employee benefits
The costs of short-term employee benefits are recognised as a liability and an expense, unless those costs are
required to be recognised as part of the cost of stock or fixed assets.

The cost of any unused holiday entitlement is recognised in the period in which the employee's services are received.

Termination benefits are recognised immediately as an expense when the company is demonstrably committed to
terminate the employment of an employee or to provide termination benefits.

Retirement benefits
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.

Leases

Rentals payable under operating leases, including any lease incentives received, are charged to profit or loss on a
straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease except where another more systematic basis is more
representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leases asset are consumed.

Foreign exchange

Transactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of
the transactions. At each reporting end date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies
are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the reporting end date. Gains and losses arising on translation in the period
are included in profit or loss.

2 Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty

In the application of the company’s accounting policies, the directors are required to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The

estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be
relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are

recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised where the revision affects only that period, or in the period of
the revision and future periods where the revision affects both current and future periods.
