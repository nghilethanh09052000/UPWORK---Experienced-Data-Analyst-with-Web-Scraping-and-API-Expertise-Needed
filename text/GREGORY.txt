Business Review

The financial year started against a backdrop of high
inflation, CPI peaking at 11.1% in October 2022, and
a number of fixed rate energy contracts expiring.
Energy prices more than trebled in a substantial
proportion of the business and the prices of
replacement vehicles, trailers and parts increased
by more than inflation.

During the first quarter, the price of fuel remained
high due to the instability in the market caused by
the war in Ukraine. Lead times for new vehicles and
trailers continued to remain high - some kit having
taken over 2 years to arrive. This led to the average
age of our fleet being older than if our usual
replacement policy had applied, with the inevitable
knock-on effect of high maintenance costs and
reduced vehicle availability. This in turn impacted
profitability due to the need for additional kit.

Vehicle reliability particularly affected our pallet
networks and our English shared user transport
businesses, both of which also saw material declines
in volume versus expectations, which inevitably
further impacted profitability.

Strategic report continued

Business Review continued

By the end of quarter one our milk business in West
Wales was also starting to see issues with fleet
reliability and long lead times for repairs. This was
compounded by unusually icy conditions in the
early winter which led to a number of vehicles being
severely damaged. We reassessed our maintenance
model in the area and significantly reduced our
reliability on third party maintenance providers by
setting up our own internal workshop in West Wales
in June 2023. This in turn reduced lead times for
repairs and improved our vehicle reliability.

From April, business rates increased by over 30%
across many of our sites and throughout the year
we felt the impact of an increase in interest costs.

Our customers were also impacted by this
challenging environment but supported us with rate
reviews to mitigate the huge inflationary pressures
we were seeing. In addition, our fuel surcharge
mechanism protected us as fuel prices peaked.

In the second and third quarters we won additional
business from both existing customers and new
customers, ali of which was implemented
seamlessly by our operational teams. This was
partly offset in the short term by the loss of a
customer at our Shepton Mallet site, and while the
warehouse space left by this customer has been
substantially re-filled, the impact on our pallet
network transport business has been significant.

Furthermore, as we moved into quarters two and
three the impact of the cost-of-living crisis on
volume deepened with a significant proportion of
our customers seeing reduced demand. This was
compounded during the summer and quarter four
due to poor weather and further reductions in
consumer confidence, which meant our usual
seasonal peak was significantly lower than
anticipated.

As a result of the lower volumes in 2023, the
business constantly reviewed its fleet levels and
worked to right size both its fleet and overhead
base. As the business exits the year it has rebased
its fixed costs and reintroduced the level of
flexibility seen pre Covid-19 , the supply chain issues
that followed it and the driver crisis. The revised mix
of own fleet, subcontractors, agency and hire kit
subsequently allows costs to track volumes more
closely.

In line with our Group strategy, we continued to
expand our warehouse footprint in Avonmouth and
the Scottish Central Belt, adding another 175,000
square feet in total, to support additional business
with existing customers. Profitability of our Scottish
Warehouses was, however, impacted in quarter 4
by delays in stock arriving from the customer.

Throughout 2023 as UK businesses reduced their
stock holdings to offset their working capital and
profitability challenges, the availability of
warehouse capacity increased significantly which
has impacted our ability to fill our warehouse in the
Midlands with the inevitable impact on profit.

Despite all of the challenges described, a number of
our dedicated contracts performed well, showing
growth on prior year and exceeding expectations.

At the end of the first quarter the business results
were in line with management expectations,
however the challenges described impacted
profitability for the rest of the year with quarter
four seeing the highest impact.

Overall, despite a hugely challenging year, the
business continued to grow organically with new
and existing customers. Revenue in the first half of
the year increased by nearly £10m versus the prior
year, however in the second half of the year the
underlying growth in revenue was offset by the
impact of lower fuel prices, lower volumes and the
slowing economy.

Strategic report continued

Business Review continued

During the year the leadership team worked hard to
mitigate the impact of higher interest rates,
inflationary challenges and volume declines with a
combination of restructuring, fixed cost reduction
and cost recovery. However, the benefits of these
mitigations will not be fully realised until the next
financial year.

The Company’s profit on ordinary activities before
taxation for the period was £6.6m (2022: £8.8m).
Turnover increased by 5.3% in the period.

The underlying business remains strong and in a
good position to overcome the current market
challenges particularly as it realises the benefits of
the restructuring work done this year and optimises
the use of its warehouses.

The Net Assets of the Company at the period end
were £22.7m (2022: £26.0m), Cash remained stable
at £9.1m (2022: £7.8m).

Future Developments

Despite a challenging 2023, the directors are
optimistic about the Group’s revenue and
profitability growth prospects. During late 2023 and
into 2024, the group has gained customers and has
commitments to increase the utilisation of its
Scottish warehouses. (t has restructured and
refocused a number of areas so as to continue
supporting our customers’ strategic initiatives,
growth plans and sustainability objectives.

We expect the economic climate to remain difficult
for all businesses for at least the first 6 months of
2024. However, while this presents challenges, we
believe we are well positioned with our unique
family business culture and our unique service
offering, to organically grow our market share. We
are actively working with potential new customers,
and through our strong partnerships we anticipate
further growth with existing customers.

Within our sector we remain a market leader in the
sustainability field, and we expect this to continue
as we are well positioned to support our customers’
sustainability goals through use of HVO
{hydrogenated vegetable oil}, CNG (compressed

natural gas), LNG (liquefied natural gas) and electric
vehicles as viable alternatives to diesel. We are able
to certify carbon emission reductions to both full
load and pallet network customers and expect the
demand for sustainable transport to increase
significantly over the year.

We maintain strong relationships with our key
suppliers and will be introducing a new Supplier
Code in 2024 to ensure our partners’ ethical goals
align with ours. It is through these strong
partnerships that we will optimise our costs and
customer solutions.

We have continued to evolve the structure of our
Management Board and our Senior Management
Team; we have created a more flexible cost base,
and we have enhanced tools for our teams to track
business performance. This, together with
anticipated additional volume in our Midlands and
Scottish warehouse operations, will drive increased
profitability in 2024.

Section 172(1) statement

The Directors of each of the Group companies have
acted in a way that they consider, in good faith,
would be most likely to promote the success of the
Group for the benefit of its members as a whole,
and in doing so having regard (amongst other
matters) to:

* the likely consequences of any decision in the
long term

* the interests of the Group's employees

* the need to foster the Group's business
relationships with suppliers, customers and others
* the impact of the Group's operations on the
community and the environment

* the desirability of the Group maintaining a
reputation for high standards of business conduct,
and

* the need to act fairly as between members of the
Group.

Section 172 considerations are embedded in Board
decision making across the Group and further
supported by the purpose, vision, values, culture
and strategy of the Group.

* Our strategy is aimed at creating long term value
for shareholders and we are proud of the reputation
and 104 year heritage of the Gregory Group.

* We are a responsible employer who cares for the
safety, welfare and wellbeing of our employees. We
nurture an environment in which our people can
flourish and seek to grow the business profitably,
legally and safely. We have high ethical standards.

* We work in partnership with our customers,
suppliers and the local communities in which we
operate. We are very aware of the environmental
impact of our operations, and we embrace change
that reduces our impact on the planet and our local
communities.

« We have created a supplier code of conduct which
ensures that our suppliers share our ethical
standards.

* We engage responsibly with our many key
stakeholders. The following section lists the key
decisions that were made during the year together
with how we engaged with the relevant
stakeholders:

1. Lease of additional warehousing.

To support the expansion of our business with a key
customer the Board made the decision to lease over
60,000 square feet of warehousing in the central
belt of Scotland. The lease was novated from
another key customer which allowed us to build our
partnership with them while supporting both their
and our strategic goals.

The decision was also made to lease an additional
115,000 square feet warehouse in the Bristol are to
support the expansion of two of our customers in
the drinks sector.

2. Shifting to a more flexible cost base.

The impact of high interest rates and the cost-of-
living crisis meant that consumer demand was
reduced, and customer volumes were lower. This
impacted profitability, and given the outlook for the
economy remained poor, the Board decided to
review its cost base, reducing its fleet size and
restructuring in a number of areas to reduce
overheads. In this way the group’s fixed cost base
was reduced and more cost variability introduced to
mitigate the impact of volume reductions.

3. Sale of an operating site.

The Board reviewed its transport operations in the
Midlands following changes to the mix of transport
work operated in the area and the opening of the
Coalville site. The Board therefore made the
decision to consolidate some of its operations in the
midlands and to sell its property located in
Minworth, this generated cash and a gain on
disposal.

Section 172(1} statement continued

4. Reducing our impact on the planet.
Sustainability continued to be at the heart of our
purpose and the board further developed its
sustainability strategy. In support of that strategy
the Board introduced HVO to a number of our
customers with 5.9m kilometres travelled on HVO
which reduces carbon emissions by 88% compared
to conventional diesel. In partnership with our
vehicle suppliers, we are kept at the forefront of
industry developments.

5. Installation of solar panels

As part of our sustainability strategy and to support
our customers by mitigating energy cost increases,
we installed solar panels on all of our chilled
warehouse sites in Devon and shared the benefit of
this investment with our customers.

engagement with our key stakeholders is

People continued

The Group invests a great deal in its people by
supporting learning and development. For over five
years we have committed to delivering
Apprenticeships. The Group has built a number of
partnerships with local providers which enable us to
deliver a wide range of Apprenticeships which
include driving, management and _ business
administration. We have an in-house operational
training team which has been an accredited Driver
Certificate of Professional Competence (DCPC)
Training Centre since 2009 and has continued to
deliver excellent quality DCPC.

The Group continues to embed an engagement
culture with its employees. We believe enhanced
meaningful engagement will have a number of
positive benefits for our business which includes
enhancing our ability to retain our employees.
Average employee turnover in our industry is
extremely high so it remains an important focus to
safeguard our business. Each area of the business
engages with our employees through clear and
appropriate two-way communication, including
employee — briefings, information cascades,
employee forums, health & safety committees and
newsletters.

This engagement is complemented by our annual
performance and development review process
which provides an opportunity for managers and
their people to engage together, giving and
receiving feedback about performance and
contribution. Once complete the Management
Board conducts a talent and succession plan review
to identify any additional training and support for
our employees. This level of engagement and
support ensures that our people are equipped with
the right skills and experience needed to reach their
potential both within their existing role and as they
progress their careers within the business.

Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland. There are no material departures from FRS 102.

Basis of preparation

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except that, as disclosed in
the accounting policies, certain items are shown at fair value, and are prepared in accordance with applicable
accounting standards.

The functional currency of the company is considered to be pounds sterling because this is the currency of the
economic environment in which the company operates.

The financial statements are presented in round thousands.

Going Concern

The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The directors have assessed the cash
balances, the financial facilities available to the company, forecasts and budgets for the next 12 months from
approval of the financial statements and the trading performance since the balance sheet date. The directors
have assumed facilities subject to regular review or repayable on demand will continue to be available. The
directors have performed sensitivity analysis on forecasts across a number of different scenarios and have
concluded the cash balances held and the current financial facilities available are sufficient that there are no
material uncertainties surrounding the going concern status of the company.

Reporting exemptions

Gregory Distribution Limited meets the definition of a qualifying entity under FRS 102 and has therefore taken
advantage of the disclosure exemptions available to it in respect of its individual financial statements.
Exemptions have been taken in relation to the presentation of a cash flow statement, certain disclosure
requirements in relation to basic and non-basic financial instruments, and disclosure of remuneration of key
management personnel. Equivalent information is presented in the group accounts.

Judgements and estimation uncertainty

The directors have considered the judgements and estimation uncertainties included in these financial
statements and the accounting policies applied and concluded that these do not have a significant effect on the
amounts recognised in the financial statements or lead to a risk of causing a material misstatement of the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. Estimates and underlying assumptions
are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the
estimate is revised if the revision affects that period only, or in the period of revision and future periods if the
revision affects both current and future periods.

Revenue recognition

Revenue is recognised to the extent that the company obtains the right to consideration in exchange for its
performance. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received, excluding discounts, rebates,
VAT and other sales taxes or duty. The following criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised:

Rendering of services
Revenue in respect of transport is recognised on delivery of goods. Revenue in respect of warehousing is
recognised on a daily basis.

Intangible fixed assets
Intangible fixed assets comprise customer contracts acquired as part of a business combination and are
measured at fair value at the acquisition date, and are amortised over a period of up to 5 years.

Tangible fixed assets and depreciation

All tangible fixed assets are initially recorded at cost. Tangible fixed assets, other than freehold land and buildings
and assets in the course of construction, are depreciated straight line over their estimated useful lives, after
deducting residual values, at the following rates:

Freehold building 50 years
Leasehold improvements Over the shorter of the life of the lease and the estimated useful lives
Motor vehicles 3-—12% years
Warehouse and garage equipment 5-10 years
Fixtures, fittings and office equipment 3-5 years

Other investments
Other investments are initially measured at fair value (which is normally the transaction price excluding
transaction costs), and subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss.

Stock
Stock represents consumable stock and is stated at cost using a weighted average purchase price.

Deferred taxation

Deferred tax is recognised without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of
certain items for taxation and accounting purposes, which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet
date, except as required by FRS 102.

Deferred tax is measured at the rates that are expected to apply in the periods when the timing differences are
expected to reverse, based on the tax rates and law enacted at the balance sheet date.

Leasing and hire purchase commitments

Assets held under finance leases, which are leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of
the asset have passed to the company and hire purchase contracts are capitalised in the balance sheet and
depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and the assets useful lives. The capital elements of future
obligations under the lease and hire purchase contracts are included as liabilities in the balance sheet. The
interest elements of the rental are charged in the profit and loss account over the primary period of the lease in
proportion to the capital element outstanding.

Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over
the lease term.

Pension costs
Retirement benefits for certain directors and employees are provided by money-purchase schemes which are
funded by contributions from the company. Contributions are charged against profits for the period in which
they are paid.

Financial instruments
Financial instruments are accounted for using the provisions of sections 11 and 12 of FRS 102.

Classification

Financial instruments are recognised when the company becomes party to the contractual provisions of the
instrument and derecognised when in the case of assets, the contractual rights to cash flows from the assets
expire or substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to another party, or in the case of
liabilities, when the company’s obligations are discharged, expire or are cancelled.

The company holds the following financial instruments:
« Other investments;
e Balances owed to/from group undertakings; and
e Long term loan creditors

Recognition and measurement

Basic financial assets and liabilities:

Basic financial assets comprise short term trade and other debtors and cash and bank balances, including short
term loans.

Basic financial liabilities comprise short term trade and other creditors including short term loans.

Such instruments are initially measured at transaction price, including transaction costs, and are subsequently
carried at the undiscounted amount of the cash or other consideration expected to be paid or received, after
taking account of impairment adjustments.

Long term toan creditors:
Long term loan creditors are initially recorded at transaction price, including transaction costs, and subsequently
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.

Financial liabilities and equity instruments — financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to
the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences
a residual interest in the net assets of the company.

3 Turnover
Turnover, which is stated net of value added tax, is attributable to the principal continuing activity of distribution
contracting including both warehousing and transport carried out in the United Kingdom.
