Accounting policies

Company information

E.Quality Training Limited is a private company limited by shares incorporated in England and Wales. The
registered office is Units 27 & 28, Whitebridge Lane, Stone, Staffordshire, United Kingdom, ST15 8LQ.

Accounting convention

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 102 “The Financial Reporting
Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland” (“FRS 102”) and the requirements of the Companies
Act 2006 as applicable to companies subject to the small companies regime. The disclosure requirements of
section 1A of FRS 102 have been applied other than where additional disclosure is required to show a true
and fair view.

The financial statements are prepared in sterling, which is the functional currency of the company. Monetary
amounts in these financial statements are rounded to the nearest £.

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention. The principal accounting
policies adopted are set out below.

Turnover

Turnover is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for services provided in
the normal course of business, and is shown net of VAT and other sales related taxes. The fair value of
consideration takes into account trade discounts, settlement discounts and volume rebates.

Revenue from contracts for the provision of professional services is recognised by reference to the stage of
completion when the stage of completion, costs incurred and costs to complete can be estimated reliably. The
stage of completion is calculated by comparing costs incurred, mainly in relation to contractual hourly staff
rates and materials, as a proportion of total costs. Where the outcome cannot be estimated reliably, revenue
is recognised only to the extent of the expenses recognised that it is probable will be recovered.

Intangible fixed assets - goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition of unincorporated businesses over the fair value of
net assets acquired. It is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less
accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is considered to have a finite useful
life and is amortised on a systematic basis over its expected life, which is 20 years.

For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the cash-generating units expected to benefit
from the acquisition. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment at
least annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment
loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other
assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.

Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost or valuation, net of
depreciation and any impairment losses.

Accounting policies {Continued}

Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over
their useful lives on the following bases:

Fixtures and fittings 3 years straight line
Computers 3 years straight line

The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the sale proceeds
and the carrying value of the asset, and is credited or charged to profit or loss.

Impairment of fixed assets

At each reporting period end date, the company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible
assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If
any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent
of the impairment loss (if any).

Stocks

Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell. Cost
comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been
incurred in bringing the stocks to their present location and condition.

Stocks held for distribution at no or nominal consideration are measured at the lower of cost and replacement
cost, adjusted where applicable for any loss of service potential.

At each reporting date, an assessment is made for impairment. Any excess of the carrying amount of stocks
over its estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell is recognised as an impairment loss in profit or
loss. Reversals of impairment losses are also recognised in profit or loss.

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents are basic financial assets and include cash in hand, deposits held at call with
banks, other short-term liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, and bank
overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities.

Financial instruments
The company has elected to apply the provisions of Section 11 ‘Basic Financial Instruments’ and Section 12
‘Other Financial Instruments Issues’ of FRS 102 to all of its financial instruments.

Financial instruments are recognised in the company’s statement of financial position when the company
becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

Financial assets and liabilities are offset, with the net amounts presented in the financial statements, when
there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a
net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Basic financial assets

Basic financial assets, which include debtors and bank balances, are initially measured at transaction price
including transaction costs and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method
unless the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where the transaction is measured at the present
value of the future receipts discounted at a market rate of interest. Financial assets classified as receivable
within one year are not amortised.

Accounting policies {Continued}

Classification of financial liabilities

Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual
arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the
assets of the company after deducting all of its liabilities

Basic financial Habilities

Basic financial liabilities, including creditors, are initially recognised at transaction price unless the
arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where the debt instrument is measured at the present value
of the future payments discounted at a market rate of interest. Financial liabilities classified as payable within
one year are not amortised.

Debt instruments are subsequently carried at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.

Trade creditors are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of
business from suppliers. Amounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one
year or less. If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities. Trade creditors are recognised initially at
transaction price and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of transaction costs.

Dividends payable on equity instruments are recognised as liabilities once they are no longer at the discretion
of the company.

1.10 Taxation

1.11

The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.

Current tax

The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as
reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or
deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The company’s
liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the
reporting end date.

Deferred tax

Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all timing differences and deferred tax assets are
recognised to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax
liabilities or other future taxable profits. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the timing difference
arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects
neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.

Employee benefits

The costs of short-term employee benefits are recognised as a liability and an expense, unless those costs
are required to be recognised as part of the cost of stock or fixed assets.

The cost of any unused holiday entitlement is recognised in the period in which the employee’s services are
received.

Termination benefits are recognised immediately as an expense when the company is demonstrably
committed to terminate the employment of an employee or to provide termination benefits.
