These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102 "The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland" including the provisions of Section 1A "Small Entities" and the Companies Act 2006. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.
Turnover

discounts, rebates, value added tax and other sales taxes.

Fixtures and fittings

33% on cost
Motor vehicles

25% on cost
Financial instruments
Basic financial assets, which include debtors and cash and bank balances, are initially measured at
transaction price including transaction costs and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the
effective interest method unless the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where the
transaction is measured at the present value of the future receipts discounted at a market rate of
interest. Financial assets classified as receivable within one year are not amortised.
Taxation
Taxation for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Statement of
Income and Retained Earnings, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other
comprehensive income or directly in equity.
Current taxation assets and liabilities are not discounted.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at
the balance sheet date.
Timing differences arise from the inclusion of income and expenses in tax assessments in periods
different from those in which they are recognised in financial statements. Deferred tax is measured
using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the year end and that
are expected to apply to the reversal of the timing difference.
Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is
probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future
taxable profits.
Hire purchase and leasing commitments
Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to surplus or deficit on a straight line basis over the
period of the lease.
Pension costs and other post-retirement benefits
The company operates a defined contribution pension scheme.
Contributions payable to the
company's pension scheme are charged to profit or loss in the period to which they relate.
