Directors’ report (continued)

Going concern

The principal activity of Parkdean Resorts UK Limited (the ‘Company’) is to act as an agent on behalf of the Richmond
UK Holdco Limited group (the ‘Group’). It is also a cross guarantor for the Richmond UK Holdco Limited group’s
(the ‘Group’) banking facility and cash flow forecasts are managed on a Group basis. The Company is reliant on the
Group to provide cash to meet its obligations as they fall due.

In order to conclude on the appropriateness of adopting the going concern basis of accounting in preparing these
financial statements, the directors have assessed the financial position of the Company and the Group at the end of
the year, and they have also considered the projected future trading and cash flows of the business and the financing
facilities available, alongside the principal risks facing the Group that could threaten its business model, trading
performance, solvency or liquidity.

During 2023, certain of the Group’s borrowing facilities were due to mature within 12 months — the £538.5m first lien
facility was set to mature in March 2024, with the revolving credit facility due to expire three months before the first
lien maturity date.

As aresult, the Group undertook a number of re-financing activities during 2023. During July 2023 the previous loan
structure was replaced in its entirety. Sufficient funds were generated from a new £550m senior term loan, new £135m
super senior revolving credit facilities and financing from the Company’s ultimate parent undertaking by way of £50m
of foan notes. The Group also entered into two asset-backed loans secured against 19 of its parks which generated a
net £145.0m cash inflow for the Group. The proceeds from these activities were used to repay in full the first and
second lien loans and the previous revolving credit facilities in advance of their maturity dates.

The Group’s re-financing activities were fully completed on 28" December 2023 following provision of further
financing from the Company’s ultimate parent undertaking by way of additional £75m loan notes. The Group’s new
facilities each have maturity dates in 2029.

The directors have assessed the risks and performance of the Company and the Group using the evidence available to
them. Forecasts and projections have been prepared against the various covenants required to be met within the new
borrowing facilities together with a range of sensitivities modelled to allow for reasonable changes in trading
performance, and these show that the Group has headroom over the outlook period. In the normal course of business
the Company will require ongoing funding to manage its working capital cycle via funding from its parent and fellow
subsidiary companies within the Richmond UK Holdco Limited Group, in order to meet its liabilities as they fall due
during the period of at least 12 months from the date of signing of the financial statements, the going concern
assessment period.

Richmond UK Holdco Limited has indicated its intention to continue to make available such funds as are needed by
the Company, and that it does not intend to seek repayment of the amounts currently due to the Group, which at
balance sheet date amounted to £623.6m during the going concern assessment period. As with any company placing
reliance on other group entities for financial support, the directors acknowledge that there can be no certainty that this
support will continue although, at the date of approval of these financial statements, they have no reason to believe
that it will not do so.

The directors have therefore concluded that it is appropriate to present the financial statements on a going concern
basis, as they consider that the Group and Company will continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months
from the date of signing the financial statements.

Annual report and financial statements

Statement of directors’ responsibilities in respect of the annual report and the
financial statement

The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable
law and regulations.

Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law they have
elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with UK accounting standards and applicable law (UK
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice), including FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework.

Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a
true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period. In
preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:

* — select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
« make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;

¢ state whether applicable UK accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures
disclosed and explained in the financial statements;

* assess the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going
concern; and

¢ use the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company
and enables them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are
responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and have general responsibility for taking
such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Company and to prevent and detect fraud
and other irregularities.

Independent auditor’s report to the members of Parkdean Resorts UK Limited

Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Parkdean Resorts UK Limited (“the Company”) for the year ended 31

December 2023 which comprise the Profit and loss account and other comprehensive income, Balance sheet,
Statement of changes in equity and related notes, including the accounting policies in note 1.

In our opinion the financial statements:

© give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2023 and of its profit for the
year then ended;

¢ have been properly prepared in accordance with UK accounting standards, including FRS 101 Reduced
Disclosure Framework; and

¢ have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable
law. Our responsibilities are described below. We have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities under, and are
independent of the Company in accordance with, UK ethical requirements including the FRC Ethical Standard. We
believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is a sufficient and appropriate basis for our opinion.

Going concern

The directors have prepared the financial statements on the going concern basis as they do not intend to liquidate the
Company or to cease its operations, and as they have concluded that the Company’s financial position means that this
is realistic. They have also concluded that there are no material uncertainties that could have cast significant doubt
over its ability to continue as a going concern for at least a year from the date of approval of the financial statements
(“the going concern period”).

In our evaluation of the directors’ conclusions, we considered the inherent risks to the Company’s business model and
analysed how those risks might affect the Company’s financial resources or ability to continue operations over the
going concern period.

Our conclusions based on this work:

¢ we consider that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial
statements is appropriate;

© we have not identified, and concur with the directors’ assessment that there is not, a material uncertainty related
to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to
continue as a going concern for the going concern period.

However, as we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in outcomes that
are inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, the above conclusions are not a
guarantee that the Company will continue in operation.

Fraud and breaches of laws and regulations ~ ability to detect
Identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement due to fraud
To identify risks of material misstatement due to fraud (“fraud risks”) we assessed events or conditions that could

indicate an incentive or pressure to commit fraud or provide an opportunity to commit fraud. Our risk assessment
procedures included:

«  Enquiring of directors, internal audit and inspection of policy documentation as to the Company’s high-level
policies and procedures to prevent and detect fraud, including the internal audit function, and the Company’s
channel for “whistleblowing”, as well as whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud.

¢ Reading Board minutes.

© Using analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships.

Parkdean Resorts UK Limited
Annual report and financial statements
31 December 2023

Independent auditor’s report to the members of Parkdean Resorts UK Limited
(continued)

We communicated identified fraud risks throughout the audit team and remained alert to any indications of fraud
throughout the audit.

As required by auditing standards, we perform procedures to address the risk of management override of controls, in
particular the risk that management may be in a position to make inappropriate accounting entries. On this audit we
do not believe there is a fraud risk related to revenue recognition because of the simplistic and easily verifiable revenue
stream.

We did not identify any additional fraud risks.
We performed procedures including:

© Identifying journal entries to test based on risk criteria and comparing the identified entries to supporting
documentation. These included those posted to unusual accounts linked to cash accounts.

Identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement due to non-compliance with laws and regulations

We identified areas of laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the financial
statements from our general commercial and sector experience, and through discussion with the directors and other
management (as required by auditing standards), and discussed with the directors the policies and procedures
regarding compliance with laws and regulations.

We communicated identified laws and regulations throughout our team and remained alert to any indications of non-
compliance throughout the audit.

The potential effect of these laws and regulations on the financial statements varies considerably.

Firstly, the Company is subject to laws and regulations that directly affect the financial statements including financial
reporting legislation (including related companies legislation), distributable profits legislation, and taxation legislation
and we assessed the extent of compliance with these laws and regulations as part of our procedures on the related
financial statement items.

Secondly, the Company is subject to many other laws and regulations where the consequences of non-compliance
could have a material effect on amounts or disclosures in the financial statements, for instance through the imposition
of fines or litigation or the loss of the Company’s license to operate. We identified the following areas as those most
likely to have such an effect: health and safety, employment law and company legislation. Auditing standards limit
the required audit procedures to identify non-compliance with these laws and regulations to enquiry of the directors
and other management and inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence, if any. Therefore, if a breach of
operational regulations is not disclosed to us or evident from relevant correspondence, an audit will not detect that
breach.

Context of the ability of the audit to detect fraud or breaches of law or regulation

Owing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk that we may not have detected some material
misstatements in the financial statements, even though we have properly planned and performed our audit in
accordance with auditing standards. For example, the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is
from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely the inherently limited procedures
required by auditing standards would identify it.

In addition, as with any audit, there remained a higher risk of non-detection of fraud, as these may involve collusion,
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls. Our audit procedures are
designed to detect material misstatement. We are not responsible for preventing non-compliance or fraud and cannot
be expected to detect non-compliance with all laws and regulations.

Strategic report and directors’ report

The directors are responsible for the strategic report and the directors’ report. Our opinion on the financial statements
does not cover those reports and we do‘not express an audit opinion thereon.

Our responsibility is to read the strategic report and the directors’ report and, in doing so, consider whether, based on
our financial statements audit work, the information therein is materially misstated or inconsistent with the financial
statements or our audit knowledge. Based solely on that work:

. we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report and the directors’ report;

. in our opinion the information given in those reports for the financial year is consistent with the financial
statements; and

. in our opinion those reports have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:

« adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from
branches not visited by us; or

¢ the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
* certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
« we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

We have nothing to report in these respects.
Directors’ responsibilities

As explained more fully in their statement set out on page 5 the directors are responsible for: the preparation of the
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view; such internal control as they determine
is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to
fraud or error; assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concem, disclosing, as applicable, matters
related to going concern; and using the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the
Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditor’s responsibilities

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial] statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue our opinion in an auditor’s report. Reasonable
assurance is a high level of assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK)
will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic
decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.

A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC’s website at
www. frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.

UK Holdco Limited group (the ‘Group’). It is also a cross guarantor for the Richmond UK Holdco Limited group’s
(the ‘Group’) banking facility and cash flow forecasts are managed on a Group basis. The Company is reliant on the
Group to provide cash to meet its obligations as they fall due. .

In order to conclude on the appropriateness of adopting the going concern basis of accounting in preparing these
financial statements, the directors have assessed the financial position of the Company and the Group at the end of
the year, and they have also considered the projected future trading and cash flows of the business and the financing
facilities available, alongside the principal risks facing the Group that could threaten its business model, trading
performance, solvency or liquidity.

During 2023, certain of the Group’s borrowing facilities were due to mature within 12 months — the £538.5m first lien
facility was set to mature in March 2024, with the revolving credit facility due to expire three months before the first
lien maturity date.

As a result, the Group undertook a number of re-financing activities during 2023. During July 2023 the previous loan
structure was replaced in its entirety. Sufficient funds were generated from a new £550m senior term loan, new £135m
super senior revolving credit facilities and financing from the Company’s ultimate parent undertaking by way of £50m
of loan notes. The Group also entered into two asset-backed loans secured against 19 of its parks which generated a
net £145.0m cash inflow for the Group. The proceeds from these activities were used to repay in full the first and
second lien loans and the previous revolving credit facilities in advance of their maturity dates.

The Group’s re-financing activities were fully completed on 28 December 2023 following provision of further
financing from the Company’s ultimate parent undertaking by way of additional £75m loan notes. The Group’s new
senior term loan and revolving credit facilities each have maturity dates in 2029.

The directors have assessed the risks and performance of the Company and the Group using the evidence available to
them. Forecasts and projections have been prepared against the various covenants required to be met within the new
borrowing facilities together with a range of sensitivities modelled to allow for reasonable changes in trading
performance, and these show that the Group has headroom over the outlook period. In the normal course of business
the Company will require ongoing funding to manage its working capital cycle via funding from its parent and fellow
subsidiary companies within the Richmond UK Holdco Limited Group, in order to meet its liabilities as they fall due
during the period of at least 12 months from the date of signing of the financial statements, the going concern
assessment period.

1.3. Going concern (continued)

Richmond UK Holdco Limited has indicated its intention to continue to make available such funds as are needed by
the Company, and that it does not intend to seek repayment of the amounts currently due to the Group, which at
balance sheet date amounted to £623.6m during the going concern assessment period. As with any company placing
reliance on other group entities for financial support, the directors acknowledge that there can be no certainty that this -
support will continue although, at the date of approval of these financial statements, they have no reason to believe
that it will not do so.

The directors have therefore concluded that it is appropriate to present the financial statements on a going concern
basis, as they consider that the Group and Company will continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months
from the date of signing the financial statements.

1.4 Classification of financial instruments issued by the Company

Financial instruments issued by the Company are treated as equity only to the extent that they meet the following two
conditions:

a) they include no contractual obligations upon the Company to deliver cash or other financial assets or to
exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially
unfavourable to the Company; and

b) where the instrument will or may be settled in the Company’s own equity instruments, it is either a non-
derivative that includes no obligation to deliver a variable number of the Company’s own equity instruments
or is a derivative that will be settled by the Company’s exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial
assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.

To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability. Where the
instrument so classified takes the legal form of the Company’s own shares, the amounts presented in these financial
statements for called up share capital and share premium account exclude amounts in relation to those shares.

Where a financial instrument that contains both equity and financial liability components exists these components are
separated and accounted for individually under the above policy.

1.5 Non-derivative financial instruments

Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity and debt securities, trade and other debtors, cash
and cash equivalents, loans and borrowings and trade and other creditors.

Investments in equity and debt securities
Investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less impairment.

Trade and other debtors . :
Trade and other debtors are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at
amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.

Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits

1.5 Non-derivative financial instruments (continued)

Interest bearing borrowings

Interest bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to
initial recognition, interest bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less
any impairment losses.

Trade and other creditors
Trade and other creditors are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at
amortised cost using the effective interest method.

1.6 Intra-group financial instruments

Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within
the Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such.’ In this respect,
the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the
Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee (see note 26).

1.7 Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate
items of property, plant and equipment.

Depreciation is charged to the statement of profit and loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of
each part of an item of property, plant and equipment. Freehold land is not depreciated. The estimated useful lives
are as follows:

Freehold buildings 15-50 years

Leasehold land Unexpired lease period

Leasehold buildings Shorter of the unexpired period of the lease or 50 years
Plant and equipment . 3-25 years

Fixtures and fittings 5-15 years

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each balance sheet date.
1.8 Right-of-use assets

Depreciation is charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of each right-of-use
asset. The estimated useful lives are as follows:

Right-of-use assets The period of the lease contract unless ownership is transferred at the end of
the lease period, whereby the estimated useful life would be determined in
accordance with property, plant and equipment (see note 1.7)

1.9 Intangible assets

Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated
impairment losses.

Amortisation

Amortisation is charged to the profit and loss account.on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of
intangible assets unless such lives are indefinite. Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and goodwill are
systematically tested for impairment at each balance sheet date. Other intangible assets are amortised from the date
they are available for use. The estimated useful lives are as follows:

Software 3-5 years

1.10 Stocks

Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of caravan, lodge and chalet holiday home
stock is valued by using specific identification of their individual costs as the items are not ordinarily interchangeable.
For other stock items the cost is based on the first-in first-out principle. Cost includes expenditure incurred in
acquiring the stocks and other costs in bringing them to their existing location and condition. Net realisable value of
used caravan stock is determined with reference to trade published guides. A provision is made for obsolete, slow
moving or defective items where required.

1.11 Impairment excluding stocks and deferred tax assets

Financial assets (including trade and other debtors)

A financial asset not carried at fair value through profit or loss is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether
there is objective evidence that it is impaired. A financial asset is impaired if objective evidence indicates that a loss
event has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset, and that the loss event had a negative effect on the estimated
future cash flows of that asset that can be estimated reliably.

An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between
its carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the asset’s original effective
interest rate. Interest on the impaired asset continues to be recognised through the unwinding of the discount. When
a subsequent event causes the amount of impairment loss to decrease, the decrease in impairment loss is reversed
through profit or loss.

Non-financial assets '

The carrying amounts of the Company’s non-financial assets, other than stocks and deferred tax assets, are reviewed
at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then
the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated.

1.12 Revenue

Revenue represents the amounts derived from the provision of management and other administrative services to
companies within the Group. The transaction prices of these management charges are based on pre-agreed terms and
are not dependent on the Company’s costs incurred. All services are transferred over time and revenue is recognised
in line with this.

1.13. Government grants

Government grants are recognised at fair value where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and
the Company will comply with the attached conditions. Government grants are deferred and recognised in the profit
and loss account over the period necessary to match them with the costs that they are intended to compensate.
Amounts recognised in the profit and loss account are presented under the heading ‘Other operating income’. There
are no unfulfilled contingencies attaching to the government assistance that has been recognised.

1.14 Expenses

Operating lease payments

Short-term leases, low-value leases and leases of intangible assets continue to be accounted for as operating leases
and are recognised in the statement of profit and loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease
incentives received for such short term leases are recognised in profit or loss as an integral part of the total lease
expense.

Other interest receivable and interest payable

Interest payable and other charges comprise interest payable, finance charges on shares classified as liabilities and
leases under IFRS 16 Leases recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method and unwinding of the
discount on provisions that are recognised in profit or loss. Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the
acquisition, construction or production of an asset that takes a substantial time to be prepared for use, are capitalised
as part of the cost of that asset. Other interest receivable and similar income comprise interest receivable on funds
invested and dividend income.

Interest receivable and interest payable is recognised in profit or loss as it accrues, using the effective interest method.
Dividend income is recognised in profit or loss on the date the Company’s right to receive payments is established.

Exceptional items

Exceptional items are items of income or expenditure which the directors consider to be unusual in nature and/or size
such that their separate presentation assists a reader of the financial statements in understanding the Company’s
performance.

1.15 Tax

Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the profit and loss
account except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income, in
which case it is recognised in equity or other comprehensive income.

Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable profit or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted
or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods.

Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
reporting purposes and the amounts used for tax purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for:
the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor
taxable profit other than in a business combination; and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent
that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the
expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted
or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is
probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.

1.16 Leases

At the inception of a contract, the Company assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or
contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in
exchange for consideration.

Lessee accounting
The Company allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of its relative stand-
alone price and the aggregate stand-alone price of the non-lease components. .

The Company recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use
asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease
payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs, less any lease incentives received.

Parkdean Resorts UK Limited
Annual report and financial statements
31 December 2023

Notes (continued)

1. Accounting policies (continued)
1.16 Leases (continued)

The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the
end of the lease term, unless the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the Company by the end of the
lease term or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the Company will exercise a purchase option. In that case
the right-of-use asset will be depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset, which is determined on the same
basis as those of property and equipment. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment
losses, if any, and adjusted for certain re-measurements of the lease liability.

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the
commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily
determined, the Company’s incremental borrowing rate.

Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:

« fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments;

e variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the
commencement date;

« amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee;
the exercise price under a purchase option that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise;
lease payments in an optional renewal period if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise an extension
option; and

¢ penalties for early termination of a lease unless the Company is reasonably certain not to terminate early.

The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is re-measured when there is
a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, there is a change in the Company’s
estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, if the Company changes its assessment

’ of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option or if there is a revised in-substance fixed lease
payment.

When the lease liability is re-measured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the
Tight-of-use asset, to the extent that the right-of-use asset is reduced to nil, with any further adjustment required from
the re-measurement being recorded in profit or loss.

2. Revenue

All revenue was derived from the Company’s principal activity, which is acting as an agent for and providing services
to the trading companies within the Group. All operations occurred within the UK. All services are transferred over
time and revenue is recognised in line with this.
