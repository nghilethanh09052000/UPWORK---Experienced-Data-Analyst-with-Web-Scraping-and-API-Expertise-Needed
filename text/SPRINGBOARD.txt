Introduction

The organisation is managed by a Chief Executive and three Heads of Departments responsible for
Operations, Performance and Finance. Each department had its own strategic objectives which linked
to the Trust's overail strategic plan.

In this financial year to 31 July 2023, 479 people were active on mainstream programmes including 408
Study Programme learners and 71 Apprentices. There remains a continuing impact of the COVID
Pandemic which has resulted in a significant impact to young people engaging in education and training,
specifically those with additional needs and those seeking apprenticeships.

Ongoing funded programmes supporting residents in community settings continued to see a large rate
of engagement and have been subject to contract extensions as a result of their successful impact. A
programme to support adults in digital skills engaged 410 clients and our welfare benefit advice project
supported 240 clients. We saw increased growth in new funded programmes cementing our position in
the community, supporting those most in need, with an additional three programmes launching in this
period

Strategic Report

The overall income of the Trust for the year was £2,762,919. This is an increase of £41,035 on the last
financial year. Total expenditure is £2,914,197, a decrease of £21,854 on the last financial year. An
operating deficit of £151,278 is recorded.

At the year end the overall fund balance of the Trust stood at £615,487, represented in a large part by
freehold properties owned by us and used to further our activities. The long term strategy of Springboard
in terms of property and resource management in areas of development has proved again to be effective
and sustainable.

Achievements and Performance

Springboard continued to be one of the North East's leading training, employment and community
development organisations.

Despite the ongoing challenges of the transition out of Covid a number of indicators showed
improvement in the year 22/23 from 21/22 including:

SPRINGBOARD SUNDERLAND TRUST
TRUSTEES’ REPORT (INCORPORATING THE DIRECTORS’ REPORT)
YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2023

Achievement of full contract value 16-19 study programme

16-19 study programme achievement rose by 5.6%

16-19 study programme retention rate rose by 10.3%

Apprenticeship positive destinations rose by 13.7

Over 95% of learners met the Condition of Funding in 22/23 resulting in zero clawback

Staffing

The organisations succession process of aligning operations staff saw a reduction in staff responsible
for supervision and an increase in learner support and delivery. This structure is now well bedded within
the key areas of SEND, Maths and English, Practical Skills, Foundation Skills and Health and Social
Care. Two Training Managers have strategic responsibility for five Team leaders reporting directly to
the Head of Training.

COVID Relief Government funding continued to allow the employment of a number of Learning Support
Assistants tasked with small group focus work targeting increased barriers as a direct result of the
Coronavirus Pandemic.

Staff numbers in 22/23 averaged 81 Including apprentices and individuals employed through the
Governments Kick Start scheme. A decrease from 95 in 21/22.

Principal risks and uncertainties

Principal risks and uncertainties over this period include the continuing Impact of ihe Coronavirus=————-——--
pandemic.

Following ESFA and central Government instruction, centres remained subject to COVID-19 restrictions.
Learner engagement and recruitment, support, delivery and back-office roles continued to be affected
with a remote function for recruitment, learning and ‘work from home’ (WFH) still partially in place.

The continuing impact of COVID-19 and face to face recruitment resulted in a significant impact to new
business across all programmes.

The implications of major reforms to the way post 16 training is funded and delivered, continued austerity
and associated budget reduction, the manner in which employers are utilising their ‘Apprenticeship Levy'
continue to compound the effect on business planning and forecasting for education and skills training.

A large reduction in the number of lower-level apprenticeships, such as those sought by Springboard
learners, and the introduction of fees for employers and ‘off the job’ requirements continue to result in a
reduction in the number of apprenticeships undertaken, in line with national results. The ongoing reform
of qualifications at Level 2 and Level 3 will continue until 2025 and will continue to impact the programme
offer.

Employer's reluctance to invest in staff development following COVID-19 continued to impact
Apprenticeship uptake with a reduction in new starts mirroring the national picture. Nationally
apprenticeships have seen a decline to around 50% of pre-Covid numbers, this is reflected regionally
with Springboards performance in the market. Whilst Kickstart funding was positive within Springboard’s
recruitment process it continued to have a wider impact on learner recruitment with employers taking
advantage of the government funded employment programme.

As a charity the economic environment within which we operate is very important. Given our mission to
work in developing sustainable communities, it often means working in areas of high social! deprivation.
The ‘UK Shared Prosperity Fund’ and subsequent replacements to the previously accessed European
Social Fund have not yet been confirmed and compound uncertainties for community support in
recognised areas of deprivation. These areas have been hit hardest by continued austerity and local
authority funding cuts reducing opportunities for community support programmes.

Future plans

The organisation has completed an alignment of staffing along three strategic departments of Training
Operations, Performance and Finance. Training Managers been appointed to be accountable for
learning programmes — Study Programme, adult learning and community projects, Apprenticeships and
Maths & English.

Staff reductions have not impacted on the effectiveness of the department. Training Managers report to-
the Head of Training. An increase of commissioned SEND (Special educational needs and disabilities)
places continues to provide Local Authority support to the development of specialist provision across
the region.

Futures Social Enterprise and the A-Spire Bistro have proven extremely popular. Futures Social
Enterprise continues to act as a seamless progression route for high need Durham Works Futures _
participants and remains an area for growth over the next 12 months. The A-Spire Bistro has built on
the success of this model utilizing existing resources to offer bespoke Hospitality and Catering Training
for a range of abilities. This project will provide additional education, training and support opportunities
for learners with SEND and increase external engagement with partner institutions identified as an area
of need by the local authority and creating additional income streams.

A continued use of social media and web-based applications have mitigated many of the challenges
presented by the transition out of COVID-19, specifically relating to engagement and recruitment. VLE
(Virtual Learning environment) delivery platforms continue to provide blended delivery to support our
learners where appropriate.

An expansion of Health and Social Care and relaunch of Engineering and Construction programmes
were completed in response to the demand for increased training and employment opportunities within
Sunderland and South Tyneside and have proven very popular with an increase in referrals.
Partnerships with national employers in Construction and Health and Social Care have resulted in
training programmes with co designed curriculums to meet the specific needs of the labour markets
emerging trends to meet the expansion in green skills jobs. This responsive curriculum development
model continues to grow with new employers to ensure best use of the range of high-quality facilities
owned by Springboard. :

The management of subcontracted provision continues to improve ensuring high standards of integrity
and quality continue to apply for all of Springboard’s learners across the region. The organisation
successfully completed the externally assessed ESFA subcontracting standard.

Alternative Education placements for pre 16 students are increasing and discussions with 2 local
authorities are underway to offer standalone provision in this growing area of need.

Additional future plans include working with our local authorities planning the upcoming UK Shared
Prosperity Fund delivery for 2023/25 and preparation for the LA7 Devolution taking place in 2025 with
a re-introduction of Adult Skills training to Springboards offer

Reserves Policy

The Trustees consider that the ideal level of reserves as at 31st July 2023 would be £750k. This has
been set as 3 months core costs expenditure. The actual level of free reserves as at 31 July 2023 is a
deficit of £509,612 and the trustees have put cost saving plans in place during the year to increase
reserves.

Income from the sale of property in 23/24 will allow us to meet our responsibilities, reduce expenditure
to build reserves in addition to investment in a number of new projects developed to meet local need.
Therefore, the Trustees are confident that there are no material risks to the Trust's ability to operate as
a going concern.

SPRINGBOARD SUNDERLAND TRUST

YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2023

Going Concern

There are no material uncertainties in respect of the charity's ability to continue as a going concern. The
Trust prepared forecasts for the period to December 2025. The Trust notes the net current liability
position at 31 July 2023 of £556,342. Study Programme allocation for the year 2023/24 is an increase
on the previous year. The trust has continued to review surplus estate in order to realise cash and help
reduce the net current liabilities. One property, in need of updating and not used in delivery of funded
programme, is currently in the process of being sold. Some funds from this sale are intended to be
used to further develop growth areas of delivery. Study Programme core funding allocation for 23/24
has increased 17% on the previous year. The trustees believe that the Trust is well placed to manage
its risks successfully and thus have adopted the going concern basis of accounting.

Statement of Trustees Responsibilities

The trustees (who are also directors of Springboard Sunderland Trust for the purposed of company law)
are responsible for preparing the trustees’ report and the financial statements in accordance with
applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice). Company Law requires directors to prepare financial statements for each financial
year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the charitable company and of the incoming
resources and application of resources, including income and expenditure, of the charitable company
for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:

_Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently

Make judgements and estimated that < are ‘reasonable and prudent
State whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material
departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and

. Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to
presume that the charity will continue in business.

.
.
.

The trustees are responsible for maintaining proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable
accuracy at any time the financial position of the charitable company and which enables them to ensure
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for
safeguarding the assets of the charitable company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

In so far as the trustees are aware:

There is no relevant audit information of which the charitable company’s auditors are unaware, and the
directors have taken all steps that they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any relevant
audit information and to establish that the auditors are aware of that information.

SPRINGBOARD SUNDERLAND TRUST

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF SPRINGBOARD
SUNDERLAND TRUST

YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2023

Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of Springboard Sunderland Trust (the 'charity') for the year
ended 31 July 2023 which comprise the statement of financial position, statement of cash flows and the
related notes, including a summary of significant accounting policies. The financial reporting framework
that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards,
including FRS 102 The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

In our opinion the financial statements:

give a true and fair view of the state of the charity's affairs as at 31 July 2023 and of its incoming
resources and application of resources, including its income and expenditure, for the year then
ended;

have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice; .

have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and
applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the auditor's
responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the
charity in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial
statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Conclusions relating to going concern

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the trustees’ use of the going concern basis
of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to
events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the charitable
company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the
financial statements are authorised for issue.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the trustees with respect to going concern are described
in the relevant sections of this report.

Other information

The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial
statements and our auditor's report thereon. The trustees are responsible for the other information
contained in the annual report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other
information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any
form of assurance conclusion thereon.

Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other
information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the
course of the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material
inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives
rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have
performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required
to report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.

¥

SPRINGBOARD SUNDERLAND TRUST

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF SPRINGBOARD
SUNDERLAND TRUST

YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2023

Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

the information given in the trustees’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and

the trustees’ report has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

Matters on which we are required to report by exception

In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the charity and its environment obtained in the course
of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the trustees’ report.

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act
2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:

adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been
received from branches not visited by us; or

the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
certain disclosures of trustees’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
we trave-net-received-all.the.information.and explanations we require for our audit; or

the trustees were not entitled to prepare the financial statements in accordance with the small
companies regime and take advantage of the small companies’ exemptions in preparing the
trustees' report and from the requirement to prepare a strategic report.

Responsibilities of trustees

As explained more fully in the trustees' responsibilities statement set out on page 6, the trustees (who
are also the directors for the purposes of company law) are responsible for the preparation of the
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal
control as the trustees determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the trustees are responsible for assessing the charity's ability to
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the
going concern basis of accounting unless the trustees either intend to liquidate the charity or to cease
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an
audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on
the basis of these financial statements.

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design
procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect
of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting
irregularities, including fraud is detailed below:

SPRINGBOARD SUNDERLAND TRUST

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF SPRINGBOARD
SUNDERLAND TRUST

YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2023

Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities,
including fraud

The objectives of our audit with regards to fraud are to design tailored and specific audit procedures to
enable us to gather sufficient audit evidence. These tests are proportionate and appropriate to the
charitable company in terms of assessed risk level and the nature of the entity's activities. However, the
primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with those charged with
governance.

We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory requirements which applied to the
charitable company, which we deemed to be the Companies Act 2006, and Statement of
Recommended Practice to charities, the Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and
Republic of Ireland (Charities SORP (FRS102)).

We obtained an understanding of how the charitable company had complied with these
regulations by reviewing their treatment of transactions, reviewing minutes of meetings and
discussing compliance with trustees and those charged with governance.

We assessed the risk of material misstatement of the financial statements, including the risk of
material misstatement due to fraud and identified that income from ESFA for education and
apprenticeships and grants is most susceptible to fraud or error. We designed our audit work to
test the controls in place regarding the processing of these transactions and how these controls
are capable of preventing or detecting fraud or error.

Our audit procedures gathered evidence to support the claims of the trustees whilst maintaining
professional scepticism to allow us to draw our own conclusion on the matter.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs (UK), we exercise professional judgment and maintain
professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to
fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit
evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not
detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error,
as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override
of internal control.

Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the internal control.

Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates and related disclosures made by the trustees.

Conclude on the appropriateness of the trustees’ use of the going concern basis of accounting
and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events
or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the charity's ability to continue as a going concern.
If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's
report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate,
to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of
our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the charity to cease to
continue as a going concern.

Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the
disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events
in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF SPRINGBOARD
SUNDERLAND TRUST

YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2023

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned
scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in
internal control that we identify during our audit.

Use of our report

This report is made solely to the charitable company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter
3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to
the charitable company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report
and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume
responsibility to anyone other than the charitable company and the charitable company's members as
a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

SPRINGBOARD SUNDERLAND TRUST
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2023

1. Accounting Policies

The principal accounting policies are summarised below. The accounting policies have been
applied consistently throughout the year and the preceding year.

Basis of Accounting

Springboard Sunderland Trust is a charitable company, limited by guarantee, registered in
England. The address of the charity's registered office and principal place of business is The Alec
Dickson Centre, Rivergreen Industry Centre, Pallion, Sunderland SR4 6AD.

Springboard Sunderland Trust meets the definition of a public benefit entity under FRS 102. The
charity exists for the benefit of the public through the provision of training and education to young
people and adults.

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Charities SORP (FRS102)
“Accounting and Reporting by Charities’; Statement of Recommended Practice applicable to
charities preparing their accounts in accordance with the Financial Reporting Standard applicable
in the UK and Republic of Ireland (FRS 102) (effective 1 January 2019), and the Companies Act
2006.

Assets and liabilities are initially recognised at historical cost of transaction value and in
accordance with the Statement of Recommended Practice “Accounting and Reporting by
Charities” effective at 1 January 2019 (Charities SORP (FRS 102)) and the Companies Act 2006.

__.The financial statements are presented in sterling which is also the functional currency of the

Charity. The monetary amounts-In-these~financial-statemonte-are-rounded ta the nearest £,
except where otherwise indicated.

Going concern

The charity had total funds of £615,487 as at 31 July 2023 (decrease of £151,278 from July 2022).
The primary factors contributing to the deficit were a significant reduction in employer uptake of
apprenticeships due to external market forces and lack of workplace capacity, resulting in a 50%
decrease in apprenticeship income, and an unforeseen increase in costs due to the rise in energy
tariffs.

The cash flow forecasts have been updated to factor in the expected level of income and
expenditure to confirm that the charity has sufficient cash for the organisation to continue for at
least 12 months from the date these financial statements are signed.

At the time of approving the financial statements, the trustees have a reasonable expectation that
the charity has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Thus, the trustees continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the
financial statements. The trustees do not consider that there are any material uncertainties to
impact the charity’s ability to continue as a going concern.

Income

Voluntary income is received by way of donations and gifts and is included in full in the statement
of financial activities when receivable. Income from the sale of goods and services is recognised
in the financial statements during the year in which the service is carried out and therefore
entitlement is earned.

Revenue and government grants are credited to the statement of financial activities when
receivable.

Where unconditional entitlement to grants receivable is dependent upon fulfilment of conditions
within the charity’s control, the incoming resources are recognised when there is sufficient
evidence that conditions will be met. Where there is uncertainty as to whether the charity can
meet such conditions the incoming resource is deferred.

-14-

SPRINGBOARD SUNDERLAND TRUST
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2023

Contract income is recognised in the financial statements to the extent that entitlement has been earned
at the year end through completion of the contract. Income from the sale of other goods and services
Is recognised in the period in which the goods or service is provided to the customer.

Investment income is included in the Statement of Financial Activities on a receivable basis.
Fund accounting

Restricted funds are to be used for specific purposes as laid down by the donor. Expenditure
which meets these criteria is charged to the fund.

Unrestricted funds are donations and other incoming resources received or generated for the
general charitable purposes.

Designated funds are unrestricted funds earmarked by the trustees for particular purposes.
Resources expended

Resources expended are recognised in the period in which they are incurred. Resources
expended include attributable VAT which cannot be recovered.

Resources expended are allocated to the particular activity where the cost relates directly to that
activity. As the charitable company only carried out one activity during the year, support costs
have not been separately analysed.

Governance costs are the costs associated with the governance arrangements of the charity.
These costs are associated with constitutional and statutory requirements and include any costs
associated with the strategic management of the charity’s activities.

Subcontractors costs represents Education & Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) income earned by
subcontractors, where the contract with the ESFA is with Springboard Sunderland Trust. This
expenditure is recognised as a lower of the profile amount payable per the contract between the
charity and the partner and the actual income earned by the partners during the period, less a
management fee.

Tangible fixed assets and depreciation
Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write down the cost of each asset to its estimated

residual value over its expected useful life. Freehold land is not depreciated. The depreciation
rates in use are as follows:

Freehold and long leasehold property 2% straight line

Office furniture and fittings 33.3% straight line
Computer equipment 33.3% straight line
Motor vehicles 33.3% straight line

Items of equipment are capitalised where the purchase price exceeds £2,000. Depreciation costs’
are allocated to activities on the basis of the use of the related assets in those activities. Assets
are reviewed for impairment of circumstances indicate their carrying value may exceed their net
realisable value and value in use.

SPRINGBOARD SUNDERLAND TRUST
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2023

Leases

Rentals payable under operating leases, where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership
remain with the lessor, are charged to the statement of financial activities on a straight line basis
over the minimum lease term.

Pensions

The Trust operates a defined contribution pension scheme for employees. The assets of the
scheme are held separately from those of the charitable company. The amount charged to the
statement of financial activities is the contributions payable in the year. Differences between
contributions payable in the year and actually paid are shown as either prepayments or other
creditors.

Agency income

The Trust acts as a agent in the administering of 16-19 Bursary Funds and free meals from the
ESFA. Related payments received from the ESFA and subsequent disbursements to students
are excluded from the statement of financial activities to the extent that the Trust does not have a
beneficial interest in the individual transactions. The allowance of 5% as a contribution to
administration costs is however recognised in the statement of financial activities. Where funds
have not been fully applied in the year then an amount will be included as amounts due to the
ESFA.

In addition, the Trust acts as an agent in the administering of Apprenticeship Grants for Empioyers
Funds from the ESFA. Related payments received from the ESFA and subsequent
disbursements to employers are excluded from the statement of financial activities to the extent
that the Trust does not have a beneficial interest in the individual transactions.

Financial instruments

The charity has elected to apply the provisions of Section 11 “Basic Financial Instruments” and
Section 12 “Other Financial Instruments Issues” of FRS 102, in full to all of its financial instruments.

All of the charities financial assets and financial liabilities qualify as basic financial instruments.
Basic Financial instruments are initially recognised at transaction value and subsequently
measured at their settlement value.

Financial assets: Trade and other debtors

Trade and other debtors which are receivable within one year and which do not constitute a
financing transaction are initially measured at the transaction price and subsequently measured at
amortised cost, being the transaction price less any amount settled and any impairment losses.

A provision for impairment of trade debtors is established when there is objective evidence that the
amounts due will not be collected according to the original terms of the contract. Impairment
losses are recognised in profit or loss for the excess of the carrying value of the trade debtor over
the present value of the future cash flows discounted using the original effective interest rate.
Subsequent reversals of an impairment loss that objectively relate to an event occurring after the
impairment loss was recognised, are recognised immediately in profit or loss.

Financial liabilities: Trade and other creditors

Trade and other creditors (including accruals) payable within one year that do not constitute a
financing transaction are initially measured at the transaction price and subsequently measured at
amortised cost, being the transaction price less any amounts settled.
