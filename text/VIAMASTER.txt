ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of preparing the financial statements

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102 "The
Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland” including the provisions of Section 1A
"Small Entities" and the Companies Act 2006. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical
cost convention.

Turnover
Turnover represents the value of services net of VAT provided under contracts to the extent that there is a right to
consideration and is recorded at the value of the consideration due

Intangible assets
Intangible assets are initially measured at cost. After initial recognition, intangible assets are measured at cost
less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.

Development costs are being amortised evenly over their estimated useful life of five years.
Tangible fixed assets

Depreciation is provided at the following annual rates in order to write off each asset over its estimated useful life
or, if held under a finance lease, over the lease term, whichever is the shorter.

Plant and machinery - 20% on reducing balance
Fixtures and fittings - 20% on reducing balance
Motor vehicles - 25% on reducing balance
Computer equipment - 33% on reducing balance

Government grants

Government grants are recognised at the fair value of the asset received or receivable when there is reasonable
assurance that the company will comply with the conditions attaching to them and the

grants will be received using the accrual model.

Taxation

Taxation for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Income Statement, except to
the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.

Current or deferred taxation assets and liabilities are not discounted.

Current tax is recognised at the amount of tax payable using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued

Deferred tax

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance
sheet date.

Timing differences arise from the inclusion of income and expenses in tax assessments in periods different from
those in which they are recognised in financial statements. Deferred tax is measured using tax rates and laws that
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the year end and that are expected to apply to the reversal of the
timing difference.

Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that they
will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.

Hire purchase and leasing commitments

Assets obtained under hire purchase contracts or finance leases are capitalised in the balance sheet. Those held
under hire purchase contracts are depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Those held under finance leases
are depreciated over their estimated useful lives or the lease term, whichever is the shorter.

The interest element of these obligations is charged to profit or loss over the relevant period. The capital element
of the future payments is treated as a liability.

Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to profit or loss on a straight line basis over the period of the
lease.

Pension costs and other post-retirement benefits

The company operates a defined contribution pension scheme. Contributions payable to the company's pension
scheme are charged to profit or loss in the period to which they relate.

EMPLOYEES AND DIRECTORS

The average number of employees during the year was 12 (2023 - 18).
