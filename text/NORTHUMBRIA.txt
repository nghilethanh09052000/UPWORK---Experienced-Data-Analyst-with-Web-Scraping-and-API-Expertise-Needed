TRUSTEES’ REPORT
FOR THE YEAR END 31 JULY 2024

The Trustees present their annual report together with the financial statements of the Company for the year 1
August 2023 to 31 July 2024. The Annual report serves the purposes of both a Trustees’ report and a directors’
report under company law. The Trustees confirm that the Annual report and financial statements of the
charitable company comply with the current statutory requirements, the requirements of the charitable company's
governing document and the provisions of the Statement of Recommended Practice (SORP) applicable to
charities preparing their accounts in accordance with the Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and
Republic of Ireland (FRS102) (effective 1 January 2019).

Since the Company qualifies as small under section 382 of the Companies Act 2006, the Strategic report
required of medium and large companies under the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’
Report) Regulations 2013 has been omitted.

Objectives and activities
e Policies and objectives
The principal objectives are as described in the structure, governance and management section of the report.

In setting objectives and planning for activities, the Trustees have given due consideration to general guidance
published by the Charity Commission relating to public benefit, including the guidance ‘Public benefit: running a
charity (PB2)’.

@ Main activities undertaken to further the Company's purposes for the public benefit

Through the medium of motor vehicle, hairdressing, hospitality and bicycle training NYA helps young people
mature and make the most of their potential. Indeed, our mission statement is:

NYA is committed to unleashing young people's full potential through the world of work and training to provide a
fuller richer life.

NYA is a specialist, independent training provider which delivers:

Pre-16 training to school students who are at risk of exclusion.

Study Programmes to 16 and 17 year olds who frequently have been refused training elsewhere.
Motor Vehicle apprenticeships to 16-25 year olds who have, as a result of placements, been employed.
Level 2 and 3 motor vehicle courses to clients within the trade who wish to gain new skills and
qualifications.

MOT related training courses to experienced motor mechanics.

. Electric vehicle maintenance courses to experienced motor mechanics.

NYA operates a fully equipped garage which services and repairs cars for members of the public, at reasonable
rates.

NYA also recycles push bikes. Our learners renovate donated bikes which are then sold, at low prices, to local
families and young people. We also give them to any learners who feel this would help them travel when starting
a work placement.

TRUSTEES’ REPORT (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR END 31 JULY 2024

Objectives and activities (continued)

Achievements and performance
e Review of activities

Despite the constant pressures of working in government funded programmes this has been another successful
year in training. NYA has raised standards in qualification achievement and progressions and developed and
implemented a more structured training timetable. NYA continues to be proactive in providing other training and
experiences for the learners, over and above their formal programme to help with employability development
and life experiences and as we continue to find new work placements, to give them the industry experience they
need and the opportunity to find an Apprenticeship or employment from this opportunity. We plan all these
opportunities depending on the individual needs of each learner, so as not to set them up to fail.

Pre-16 North Tyneside Council

Provision of courses for young people living in North Tyneside has been popular and effective. The majority of
young people referred to this programme are reluctant school attenders. Numbers have been high and as a
result, income from this work has been relatively high throughout the year.

Pre-16 Various

Significant income has been generated by providing “one off’ courses for a range of young people. Income has
resulted from close liaison with a number of schools in the North Tyneside, Newcastle and South Tyneside
areas.

Post-16 Study Programmes

Study Programmes were introduced by the Government in August 2013. Our occupancy levels are now back to a
satisfactory level and we have met our contract value for last year. Overall, this area of work has been very
successful and productive. Our achievement and progression rates are rising and we have achieved the targets
set out on our Service level agreement of 75% and 83% respectively in 2023/24.

Post-16 Apprenticeships

Delivered by sub contract to Resources NE Ltd. Our experience continues to be that employers are not prepared
to take young people on a fully paid apprenticeship until they have seen the young people working on placement.
We have continued to give dedicated staff time to opening more placements with employers and despite
changes to apprenticeship funding and conditions, this has again produced a small number of apprenticeships.
The Apprenticeship programme has not proved to be as successful as we had hoped and both learners and
Employers have become discouraged with the time and intensity of the qualification and the fact no End point
assessment centres can be accessed locally adding to extra costs for the Employer.

Employers

We have continued to proactively develop relationships with reputable employers with a view to obtaining
placements and ultimately employment. This takes up a considerable amount of time and we now have 3 staff
members working on this area. Evidence suggests this work is very much to the benefit of our learners. Those
on work placement learn and develop skills and complete their evidence much better than when in the training
centre as they do not get the distractions.

TRUSTEES’ REPORT (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR END 31 JULY 2024

Achievements and performance (continued)

Hairdressing

Hairdressing focused on Pre 16 students from school, until the trainer left in June 2023. We have not continued
with this subject area.

Hospitality

Hospitality focused on Post 16 learners but the maximum enrolled was 5 and therefore not cost effective. When
the trainer left in February 2023, we continued with 2 learners to gain their qualifications, but have made the
decision to not continue with his subject area.

Additional income sources

NYA has continued to deliver MOT training courses in MOT station management, MOT tester training and
annual MOT tester refreshers. :

Carrying out MOT tests and subsequent repairs to MOT failures has also continued to produce significant
additional funding.

NYA is frequently being asked, by employers, to train adult mechanics who are already employed. This training
does not involve Government funding but does generate income for NYA. Courses being offered include:

Level 3 diploma in vehicle maintenance and repair

Air conditioning systems servicing
Income from all of these sources is used to overcome the shortfall in Government funding. It enables NYA to
work with small numbers of young people aged 16 21 for whom Government funding is unavailable or reduced.

We increased the cost of these courses in October 2023 and this has continued to give us a good stream of
income to offset the lack of government money.

Financial review

e Going concern

After making appropriate enquiries, the Trustees have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt
the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. Further details regarding the adoption of the going
concern basis can be found in the accounting policies.

e Review of the year

Restricted funds carried forward are £Nil (2023: £Nil) as a result of all income relating to restricted funds being
expensed in the year.

Unrestricted funds increased by £13,387 prior to a depreciation charge of £36,702, resulting in a decrease of
£23,315 to £1,112,286 (2023: £1,135,601).

NORTHUMBRIA YOUTH ACTION LIMITED
(A company limited by guarantee)

TRUSTEES’ REPORT (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR END 31 JULY 2024

Structure, governance and management
@ Constitution

- Northumbria Youth Action Limited is registered as a charitable company limited by guarantee and was set
up by a Memorandum of Association on 14 January 2000.

: The company is constituted under a Memorandum of Association and is a registered charity number
1064098.

The principal objectives of the company are:-

- To create the opportunity for young people from Northumbria to participate in challenging activities that
offer new experiences, enhance skills and build a sense of achievement and self-esteem.

- To create opportunities for young people to develop responsible attitudes.

- To allow access to the workshop environment in which young people can learn skills in motor vehicle,
hairdressing, hospitality and allied trades, which could assist in gaining employment or progression into
training.

- To provide training to young people in automotive vehicle maintenance and repair, vehicle fitting,
hairdressing, hospitality, functional skills and bicycle repair. The target group consists of all those young
people in the community, with an emphasis on the less advantaged and those at risk.

- The trainees include young people who have not engaged recently in education, employment or training
(NEET). All young people should be engaged in learning or work opportunities that are appropriate to
their needs, so that they can acquire the skills, knowledge and confidence they need to build a positive
future and stay away from crime and anti-social behaviour.

Methods of appointment or election of Trustees

The management of the company is the responsibility of the Trustees who are elected and co-opted under the
terms of the Articles of Association. The trustees retiring by rotation who, being eligible, are available for re-
election are Brenda Gildea, Duncan Campbell and Paul Cook.

Patron & Vice Patron

Lord Stevens of Kirkwhelpington has continued to be an active patron of Northumbria Youth Action Limited. He
was extremely helpful in developing contacts between the Charity and the Business Sector, but since he has
retired from the Police force has not been as active.

John Squires OBE agreed to act as vice patron. He has been particularly helpful in developing NYA's contacts

with the motor trade and refining our business plan over the years , however since his retirement has not been
as active with NYA, although we know if we have motor trade issues we could contact him for advice.

TRUSTEES’ REPORT (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR END 31 JULY 2024

Structure, governance and management (continued)

e Organisational structure and decision-making policies

The company is organised so that the Trustees meet regularly to manage the affairs of the charity and to agree
to ongoing developments. There are now two managers, following the retirement of Mike Johnson and Jim
Coltman in October and April respectively, Carolyn Mount and Shaun Sutton. Carolyn manages the day to day
running of the charity, the training contract and business and oversees fundraising activities. Shaun Sutton
manages the garage activities. There are four qualified vocational trainers, plus additional sessional staff
employed when required, to deliver vocational and other qualifications which the charity has undertaken to
provide. There is an internal verifier, qualified functional skills teacher, two admin staff and a support officer. The
charity uses Ryecroft Glenton as its accountants and during the financial year banked with Natwest Bank plc.

@ Financial risk management

The Trustees have assessed the major risks to which the Company is exposed, in particular those related to the
operations and finances of the Company, and are satisfied that systems and procedures are in place to mitigate
exposure to the major risks.

Plans for future periods

The past year has been very successful. It is our intention to maintain standards of training and to further expand
the courses offered. We would like to offer a Pre study programme for those not quite ready to embark on a
fulltime qualification and all the evidence gathering and exams. An Employability programme could be a good
introduction with a work placement in the garage for those who are keen to progress onto the Motor vehicle
course.

Pre 16 Training

It is our intention to maintain current levels of occupancy — offering up to 12 pre 16 places per day to our current
clients. All referring schools/agencies have indicated they intend to continue working with NYA in the next
academic year. Our current tutor is looking to retire next summer so we will need to consider who will take over
this role as it is a programme we need to consider maintaining.

Post 16 Training
Study programmes are established and working well and have been improving over the last couple of years.

Last year saw a change to the delivery of the programme and more 1-1 sessions offered to those who required
more support, hence improving our achievement rate. We have noticed more young people attending with
EHCP's and we are undertaking some staff training so,staff can better identify and develop strategies to support
them.

We have approached North Tyneside Council to enquire about any work we could do to support any gaps in
provision for young people as we need to bid for the Barnardos contract next year. As this is our main source of
income we need to plan for other work should we not be successful.
