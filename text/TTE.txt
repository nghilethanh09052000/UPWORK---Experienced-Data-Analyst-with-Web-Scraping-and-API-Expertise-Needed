Accounting policies

Company information
TTE Training Limited is a private company limited by guarantee incorporated in England and Wales. The registered
office is New Horizons House, New Bridge Road, Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, CH65 4LT.

Accounting convention

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 102 “The Financial Reporting Standard
applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland” (“FRS 102") and the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 as
applicable to companies subject to the small companies regime. The disclosure requirements of section 1A of FRS
102 have been applied other than where additional disclosure is required to show a true and fair view.

The financial statements are prepared in sterling, which is the functional currency of the company. Monetary amounts
in these financial statements are rounded to the nearest £.

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention. The principal accounting policies
adopted are set out below.

The company has taken advantage of the exemption under section 399 of the Companies Act 2006 not to prepare
consolidated accounts, on the basis that the group of which this is the parent qualifies as a small group. The financial
statements present information about the company as an individual entity and not about its group.

Going concern

At the time of approving the financial statements, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the company has
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus the directors continue to
adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.

Turnover

Income from contracts is recagnised in line with the delivery on the contracted services to trainees. The recurrent
grants from the ESFA represent the funding allocations attributable to the current financial year and are credited
directly to the income and expenditure account. Recurrent grants are recognised in line with planned activity. Any
undei-achievement against this planned activity is adjusted in the year and reflected in the level of recurrent grant
recognised in the income and expenditure account. Provisions for potential clawbacks are established where it is
anticipated that funding may be subject to clawback.

Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost or valuation, net of
depreciation and any impairment losses.

Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over their useful
lives on the following bases:

Freehold land and buildings Nil - 2% straight line
Leasehold improvements 10% straight line

Plant and machinery 10% - 33% straight line
Fixtures, fittings and equipment 10% straight line

Freehold land is not depreciated.

The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the sale proceeds and the
carrying value of the asset, and is credited or charged to surplus or deficit.

Accounting policies (Continued)

Fixed asset investments

Interests in subsidiaries are initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated
impairment losses. The investments are assessed for impairment at each reporting date and any impairment losses or
reversals of impairment losses are recognised immediately in profit or loss.

A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the company. Control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies
of the entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.

Impairment of fixed assets

At each reporting period end date, the company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible assets to determine
whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the
recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any).

Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the
estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future
cash flows have not been adjusted.

If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset
is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless the
relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.

Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are basic financial assets and include cash in hand and deposits held at call with banks.

Financial instruments
The company has elected to apply the provisions of Section 11 ‘Basic Financial Instruments’ of FRS 102 to all of its
financial instruments.

Financial instruments are recognised in the company's balance sheet when the company becomes party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument.

Basic financial assets

Basic financial assets, which include trade and other debtors, amounts owed by group undertakings and cash and
bank balances, are initially measured at transaction price including transaction costs and are subsequently carried at
amortised cost using the effective interest method.

Classification of financial liabilities

Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements
entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the company after
deducting all of its liabilities.

Basic financial liabilities
Basic financial liabilities, including trade and other creditors, amounts due to group undertakings and bank loans are

initially recognised at transaction price.

Debt instruments are subsequently carried at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2024

1.9

Accounting policies (Continued)

Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of transaction costs. Dividends
payable on equity instruments are recognised as liabilities once they are no longer at the discretion of the company,

Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.

Current tax

The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the
profit and loss account because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years
and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The company’s liability for current tax is calculated
using tax rates that have besn enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting end date.

Deferred tax

Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all timing differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the
extent that it is probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable
profits. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the timing difference arises from goodwill or from the initial
recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting end date and reduced to the extent that it is
no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the
asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the profit and loss account, except when it relates to items
charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are offset when the company has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and
the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority.

Employee benefits
The costs of short-term employee benefits are recognised as a liability and an expense.

The cost of any unused holiday entitlement is recognised in the period in which the employee's services are received.

Termination benefits are recognised immediately as an expense when the company is demonstrably committed to
terminate the employment of an employee or to provide termination benefits.

Retirement benefits

For defined contribution schemes the amount is charged to profit and loss is the contributions payable in the year.
Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or
prepayments.

Leases

Rentals payable under operating leases, including any lease incentives received, are charged to profit or loss on a
straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease except where another more systematic basis is more
representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leases asset are consumed.

Accounting policies (Continued)

Government grants
Government grants are recognised at the fair value of the asset received or receivable when there is reasonable
assurance that the grant conditions will be met and the grants will be received.

A grant that specifies performance conditions is recognised in income when the performance canditions are met.
Where a grant does not specify performance conditions it is recognised in income when the proceeds are received or
receivable. A grant received before the recognition criteria are satisfied is recognised as a liability.

Grants relating to an asset are recognised in income systematically over the asset's expected useful life. If part of such
a grant is deferred it is recognised as deferred income rather than being deducted from the asset's carrying amount.

Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty

In the application of the company's accounting policies, the directors are required to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The
estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be
relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised where the revision affects only that period, or in the period of
the revision and future periods where the revision affects both current and future periods.

Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The estimates and assumptions which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount
of assets and liabilities are as follows.

Useful economic lives of fixed assets

Depreciation is provided ta write down the assets over the estimated economic useful lives as set out in the Company's
accounting policies. The selection of these estimated lives requires the exercise of management judgement. Useful
lives are regularly reviewed and should management's assessment of useful lives change, then depreciation charges
and carrying value of fixed assets in the financial statements would change accordingly.
