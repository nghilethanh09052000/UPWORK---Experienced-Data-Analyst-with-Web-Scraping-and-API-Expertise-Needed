Statement of Directors’ Responsi es

The directors acknowledge their responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in
accordance with applicable law and regulations.

Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the
directors have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company law the directors
must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of
affairs of the company and of the profit or loss of the company for that period. In preparing these financial statements,
the directors are required to:

* — select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently:
* make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;

prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company
will continue in business.

The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the
company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and
enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible
for safeguarding the assets of the company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of
fraud and other irregularities.

Summary of significant accounting policies and key accounting estimates

The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These
policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.

Audit report

As the profit and loss has been omitted from the filing copy of the financial statements, the following information in
relation to the audit report on the statutory financial statements is provided in accordance with s444(5B) of the
Companies Act 2006.

The Independent Auditors’ Report was unqualified. The name of the Senior Statutory Auditor who signed the audit
report on 31 March 2025 was Richard Wilch FCCA, who signed for and on behalf of Cottons Accountants LLP.

Judgements

In applying the Company's accounting policies, the directors are required to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions in determining the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities. The directors’ best judgements, estimates
and assumptions are based on the best and most reliable evidence available at the time when the decisions are made,
and are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be appropriate.

Due to the inherent subjectivity involved in making such judgements, estimates and assumptions, the actual results and
outcomes may differ.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised, if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of
the revision and future periods, if the revision affects both current and future periods.

Revenue recognition

Turnover comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and provision of
services in the ordinary course of the company’s activities. Turnover is shown net of sales/value added tax, returns,
rebates and discounts.

The company recognises revenue when:

The amount of revenue can be reliably measured;

it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity;

and specific criteria have been met for each of the company's activities.

Government grants

Grants which relate to revenue are recognised in income in the period the related costs are incurred by the entity for
which the grant is intended to compensate. For grants which are received by the entity for compensation for expenses
or losses which have already been incurred, the grant is recognised in income when it is received or receivable.

Tax

The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in profit or loss, except that a
change attributable to an item of income or expense recognised as other comprehensive income is also recognised
directly in other comprehensive income.

The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the reporting date in the countries where the company operates and generates taxable income.

Page 6

Heart of England Training Limited
Notes to the Abridged Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 July 2024

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences between taxable profits and profits reported in the
financial statements.

Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised when it is probable that they will be recovered
against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.

Deferred tax is measured using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting
date and that are expected to apply to the reversal of the timing difference.

Tangible assets

Tangible assets are stated in the balance sheet at cost, less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent
accumulated impairment losses.

The cost of tangible assets includes directly attributable incremental costs incurred in their acquisition and installation.

Depreciation

Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than land and properties under construction over
their estimated useful lives, as follows:

Asset class Depreciation method and rate
Short leasehold Over the period of the lease
Fixtures and fittings 20% on reducing balance

Motor vehicles 15% on straight line

Business combinations

Business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method. The consideration for each acquisition is
measured at the aggregate of the fair values at acquisition date of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and
equity instruments issued by the group in exchange for control of the acquired, plus any costs directly attributable to
the business combination. When a business combination agreement provides for an adjustment to the cost of the
combination contingent on future events, the group includes the estimated amount of that adjustment in the cost of
the combination at the acquisition date if the adjustment is probable and can be measured reliably.

Investments

Investments in equity shares which are publicly traded or where the fair value can be measured reliably are initially
measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss. Investments in equity shares which are not
publicly traded and where fair value cannot be measured reliably are measured at cost less impairment.

Interest income on debt securities, where applicable, is recognised in income using the effective interest method.
Dividends on equity securities are recognised in income when receivable.

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and call deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that
are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value.

Trade debtors

Trade debtors are amounts due from customers for merchandise sold or services performed in the ordinary course of
business.

Trade debtors are recognised initially at the transaction price. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost using
the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. A provision for the impairment of trade debtors is
established when there is objective evidence that the company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to
the original terms of the receivables.

Stocks

Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell. Cost is determined
using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.

The cost of finished goods and work in progress comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs
and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. At
each reporting date, stocks are assessed for impairment. If stocks are impaired, the carrying amount is reduced to its
selling price less costs to complete and sell; the impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.

Trade creditors

Trade creditors are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business
from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if the company does not have an unconditional right,
at the end of the reporting period, to defer settlement of the creditor for at least twelve months after the reporting
date. If there is an unconditional right to defer settlement for at least twelve months after the reporting date, they are
presented as non-current liabilities.

Trade creditors are recognised initially at the transaction price and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the
effective interest method.

Leases

Leases in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating
leases. Payments made under operating leases are charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the period of
the lease.

Share capital

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Equity instruments are measured at the fair value of the cash or other
resources received or receivable, net of the direct costs of issuing the equity instruments. If payment is deferred and
the time value of money is material, the initial measurement is on a present value basis.

Dividends

Dividend distribution to the company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the
reporting period in which the dividends are declared.

Defined contribution pension obligation

A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which fixed contributions are paid into a pension fund and the
company has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions even if the fund does not hold sufficient
assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.

Contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as employee benefit expense when they are due. If
contribution payments exceed the contribution due for service, the excess is recognised as a prepayment.

Financial instruments

Classification

The company only enters into basic financial instruments transactions that result in the recognition of financial assets
and liabilities like trade and other accounts receivable and payable, loans from banks and other third parties and loans
to related parties.

Debt instruments such as loans and other accounts receivable and payable are initially measured at present value of the
future payments and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method; Debt instruments that are
payable or receivable within one year, typically trade payables or receivables, are measured, initially and subsequently,
at the undiscounted amount of the cash or other consideration expected to be paid or received. However if the
arrangements of a short-term instrument constitute a financing transaction, such as the payment of a trade debt
deferred beyond normal business terms or financed at a rate of interest that is not a market rate or in the case of an
outright short-term loan not at market rate, the financial asset or liability is measured, initially and subsequently, at the
present value of the future payments discounted at a market rate of interest for a similar debt instrument.

Financial assets that are measured at cost and amortised cost are assessed at the end of each reporting period for
objective evidence of impairment. If objective evidence of impairment is found, an impairment loss is recognised in
profit or loss,

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the statement of financial position when there
is an enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to realise
the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
