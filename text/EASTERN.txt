ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of preparing the financial statements

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102 "The Financial
Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland" including the provisions of Section 1A “Small Entities”
and the Companies Act 2006. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as
modified by the revaluation of certain assets.

Turnover
Turnover is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, excluding discounts, rebates, value
added tax and other sales taxes.

Tangible fixed assets
Depreciation is provided at the following annual rates in order to write off each asset over its estimated useful life.

Taxation
As per the directors the company is treated as tax exempt until such time that H M Revenue and Customs reviews the
company's requirement to file a tax return.

Deferred tax

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the statement of
financial position date.

Timing differences arise from the inclusion of income and expenses in tax assessments in periods different from those in
which they are recognised in financial statements. Deferred tax is measured using tax rates and laws that have been
enacted or substantively enacted by the period end and that are expected to apply to the reversal of the timing difference.

Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that they will be
recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.

Hire purchase and leasing commitments
Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to profit or loss on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.

Pension costs and other post-retirement benefits

The company operates a defined contribution pension scheme. Contributions payable to the company’s pension scheme
are charged to profit or loss in the period to which they relate.

EMPLOYEES AND DIRECTORS

The average number of employees during the period was 3 (2022-5).
