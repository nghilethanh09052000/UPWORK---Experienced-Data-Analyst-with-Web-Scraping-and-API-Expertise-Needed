FIRST RUNG LIMITED (REGISTERED NUMBER: 02171777)

REPORT OF THE TRUSTEES
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31ST JULY 2024

The trustees who are also directors of the charity for the purposes of the Companies Act 2006, present their report with the financial
statements of the charity for the year ended 31st July 2024. The trustees have adopted the provisions of Accounting and Reporting by
Charities: Statement of Recommended Practice applicable to charities preparing their accounts in accordance with the Financial
Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland (FRS 102) (effective 1 January 2019).

OBJECTIVES AND ACTIVITIES

Objectives and aims

- To advance education for the public benefit, particularly but not exclusively, by the provision of vocational
training.

The relief of unemployment for the public benefit, particularly, but not exclusively, by the provision of training,
retraining and periods of work experience through the programmes of the Education and Skills Funding Agency
(ESFA), or similar programmes funded by local and central Government, corporate partners and the European
Social Fund.

To deliver training and development to young people so that their employment prospects are significantly
improved. This can be through classroom or digital delivery.

To provide learning, training, and work experience opportunities for young people to prepare them for the
world of work. This is tailored to the individual needs of the young person and is supported by a
comprehensive pastoral care programme.

Public benefit
Trustees of a charity have a duty to report on their charity's public benefit. The Trustees of First Rung Limited have considered the
guidance issued by the Charity Commission. The Trustees have concluded that:-

The aims and activities of the organisation continue to be charitable;

The aims and the work done give identifiable benefits in the charitable sector and both directly and indirectly to
young people in need;

The benefits are for the public, are not unreasonably restrictive in any way and certainly not by ability to pay;
There is no detriment or harm arising from the aims and activities.

The trustees can confirm that they are complying with the Charity Commission's guidance on public benefit. First Rung is a
registered charity; its only activity is the provision of learning, training and preparing young people for work. Prior to joining us
many of our learners struggle to identify the next stage in their education or work. The charity, by providing tailor made courses
combined with excellent pastoral care, nurtures the young people, enabling them to make the next step in their journey for the benefit
of society, local employers and the economy.

Activities

Study Programme

First Rung continues to deliver the 16-18 years old Study programme, which offers bespoke learning and employability provision to
young people based on their needs and prior attainment. The aim is to provide young people with the skills and qualifications to
progress to an apprenticeship, employment or further education.

Learners have the opportunity to achieve a level 1 vocational qualification in either Accountancy, Business Administration, Customer
Service or Health and Social Care. They develop their skills in English, Mathematics and ICT by undertaking the Functional Skills
qualification at the appropriate level. First Rung continues to offer GCSE English and Mathematics provision to learners who did not
previously achieve at least a grade 3 in these subjects.

All learners on the programme attend preparation for life and work sessions to support them to develop the necessary skills and
attributes to sustain employment and be a good citizen, All learners are also expected to undertake a work placement as part of the
programme.

REPORT OF THE TRUSTEES
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31ST JULY 2024

OBJECTIVES AND ACTIVITIES

Apprenticeships

Apprenticeships offer employers the opportunity both to recruit new staff who will be trained to industry standard while they work,
and to up-skill existing staff.

Companies with an annual pay bill of more than £3 million have to pay an apprenticeship levy at a rate of 0.5% of their annual pay
bill. They can use this fund to provide apprenticeship training to their staff. The funds are accessed through the Digital
Apprenticeship Service (DAS) system. Apprenticeship standards provide a structure of industry relevant to both on and off the job
training. Off the job training is delivered by First Rung either in centre or on-line. On the job training is delivered in work by the
employer. Apprenticeships are both level 2 and 3 and are delivered in a range of vocational areas.

Smaller employers who are not required to pay the apprenticeship levy can also employ and train apprentices. Funding for the
training delivered by First Rung is drawn down from the Digital Apprenticeship Service. Duc to a change in government policy, these
apprenticeships are now fully funded, the employer no longer has to contribute.

During the year ended 31 July 2024 First Rung delivered apprenticeships in the areas of Early Years, Teaching Assistant,
Accountancy, Business Administration and Customer Service.

Back on Track Targeted NEET Greater London Authority
This NEET (Not in Employment, Education or Training) programme launched in April 2024, was designed to focus on young

Londoners who are furthest from the labour market and experiencing multiple forms of disadvantage and/or have significant
additional support needs including:

- Looked after children or care leavers.

- Those who are homeless or at risk of homelessness.

- Those involved in substance misuse and/or criminal activity.

- Young carers.

- Those with SEND (Special Educational Needs and Disabilities).

The GLA divided the programme into 4 areas of London. First Rung was awarded a grant for the Ponders End site in the North &
East London area. All participants are supported on a one-to-one basis by an advisor.

Jobs and Skills for Londoners Greater London Authority

First Rung launched Health and Social Care programmes through a project called "Skills and Jobs for Londoners" for learners aged
19 and over study qualifications at levels 2 and 3.

High Needs Support
First Rung has become a specialist provider of support to learners aged 16-25 who have additional needs identified in an Education,

Health and Care Plan (EHCP), First Rung supported 20 learners during the year, funded jointly through the ESFA and local
authorities.

UK Shared Prosperity Fund UKSPF - Multiply Programme

Towards the end of the year, First Rung secured funding as a subcontractor to Harrow, Uxbridge and Richmond College to deliver
numeracy training to young people aged 16-25.

ACHIEVEMENT AND PERFORMANCE
Achievements

Delivery of Learning
First Rung supported 249 Study Programme and 50 apprentices learners during the year.

Quality of Provision

The Charity's aim is continuously to improve the quality of the learning that it provides. To achieve this aim, each year a critical
self-assessment is undertaken, the findings from which are used to preduce a Quality Improvement Plan (QIP) which identifics the
areas requiring attention, the person tasked with the work and the deadline of completion.

Ofsted

The Apprenticeship, Study Programme and High Needs provision is subject to inspection by Ofsted. First Rung was inspected by
Ofsted in December 2022 and was graded "Good" overall. This included a "Good" judgement in the new areas of Apprenticeships
and High Needs support.

Fundraising activities
During this financial year, the Trustees decided that the environment and circumstances were still not conducive to active fundraising.
In the future, we will return to active fundraising when the time is right and opportunities arise.

40th Anniversary Celebration
First Rung marked its 40th anniversary in November 2023 with a celebration event at the Crown Hotel, Cricklewood. The event was
attended by learners, employers, partners, trustees and the staff team and included an awards ceremony.

FINANCIAL REVIEW

Results for the Financial Year and Long Term Strategy

The financial health of the organisation has continued to improve resulting in a surplus of £179,466 for the year ended 31 July 2024.
During the year the organisation continued to invest in staff development, including teacher training and purchased IT hardware for
staff and learners.

Risks attached to achievement of objectives

First Rung faces risks from changes in Government priorities in employment and skills provision; to mitigate this risk the Charity is
proactively looking to diversify into alternative income streams, so that there is less dependence on the ESFA contract which at
present constitutes the majority of our income. There has been some success in this area with the securing of UKSPF Fund and First
Rung was awarded a Greater London Authority contract in 2022-23, followed by another in 2023-24.

The safety of our learners, many of whom are vulnerable, is of paramount importance to First Rung. To mitigate the risks, all staff
and trustees are DBS (Disclosure and Barring Service) checked and have regular training in Safeguarding, ‘Prevent! and bullying
awareness. Safeguarding is included as a topic for discussion at every Board meeting.

Investment policy and objectives

It is the policy of the Trustees to invest surplus cash in short term cash deposits. From time to time the Trustees, via the Finance &
Premises Committee, look at the overall resources of the organisation and its future needs in order to establish whether there is scope
for extending the range of investments. The organisation's improving financial position now allows for over half of our reserves to be
held in short term deposits.

Reserves policy

The Trustees have agreed that, in the short term, free reserves (net current assets) should be maintained at a minimum level of three
months of operating costs, in order to provide cover in the event of any interruption of income and to enable opportunities to invest in
the organisation as they arise. The free reserves at 31 July 2024 were £471,710 (£292,244 as at 31 July 2023) and now just exceed the
Trustees' target of 3 months’ operating costs. This strategy includes a commitment to move to a free reserves level that consistently
exceeds three months. Continuing to operate at a surplus this year supports this policy.

STATEMENT OF TRUSTEES' RESPONSIBILITIES
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31ST JULY 2024

The trustees (who are also the directors of First Rung Limited for the purposes of company law) are responsible for preparing the
Report of the Trustees and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

Company law requires the trustees to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state
of affairs of the charitable company and of the incoming resources and application of resources, including the income and
expenditure, of the charitable company for that period. In preparing those financial statements, the trustees are required to

select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;

observe the methods and principles in the Charity SORP;

make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;

prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the charitable company will
continue in business.

The trustees are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial
position of the charitable company and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the charitable company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularitics.

REPORT OF THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS TO THE MEMBERS OF
FIRST RUNG LIMITED

Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of First Rung Limited (the 'charitable company’) for the year ended 31st July 2024 which
comprise the Statement of Financial Activities, the Statement of Financial Position, the Statement of Cash Flows and notes to the
financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that has been applied
in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice).

In our opinion the financial statements:

- give a true and fair view of the state of the charitable company's affairs as at 31st July 2024 and of its incoming resources and
application of resources, including its income and expenditure, for the year then ended;

- have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and

- have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
section of our report. We are independent of the charitable company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to
our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Conclusions relating to going concern
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the trustees’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the
preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that,
individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the charitable company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period
of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the trustees with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this
report,

Other information
The trustees are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Annual
Report, other than the financial statements and our Report of the Independent Auditors thereon.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in
our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider
whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are
required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work
we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.

Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

- the information given in the Report of the Trustees for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is
consistent with the financial statements; and

- the Report of the Trustees has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

Page 7

REPORT OF THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS TO THE MEMBERS OF
FIRST RUNG LIMITED

Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the charitable company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we
have not identified material misstatements in the Report of the Trustees.

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our
opinion:

- adequate accounting records have not been kept or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited
by us; or

the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or

certain disclosures of trustees’ remuncration specificd by law are not made; or

we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or

the trustees were not entitled to take advantage of the small companies exemption from the requirement to prepare a Strategic
Report or in preparing the Report of the Trustees.

Responsibilities of trustees

As explained more fully in the Statement of Trustees' Responsibilities, the trustees (who are also the directors of the charitable
company for the purposes of company law) are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that
they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the trustees determine is necessary to enable the preparation of
financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the trustees are responsible for assessing the charitable company's ability to continue as a going
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the
trustees either intend to liquidate the charitable company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue a Report of the Independent Auditors that includes our opinion. Reasonable
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect
a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in
the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial
statements.

The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below:

Based on our understanding of the company and the sector in which it operates, we identified the principle risks of non-compliance
with laws and regulations related to charitable companies and the application of charitable funds. We also considered those laws and
egulations which have a direct impact on the preparation of the financial statements such as the Companies Act 2006 and the
Charities SORP (FRS 102).

n

Through enquiry of management we gained an understanding of their relevant laws and regulations; the entity's policies and
procedures regarding compliance; and how they identify, evaluate and account for litigation claims. We understand that the company
complies with the framework through having in place robust procedures and policies and by outsourcing and taking external
professional legal, tax and accounting advice on relevant specialist functions and areas.

The senior statutory auditor led a discussion with all members of the engagement team regarding the susceptibility of the company’s
financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur. The areas identified in this discussion were:
- Manipulation or error in the classification of income leading to the under or overstatement of unrestricted or
restricted funds.
- Manipulation or error in the use of funds leading to expenditure which is not in accordance with the charitable
company’s objectives.

Page 8

REPORT OF THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS TO THE MEMBERS OF
FIRST RUNG LIMITED

The procedures we carried out to gain sufficient appropriate audit evidence in the above areas included:

- dentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error,
design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from
raud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion of the effectiveness of the
charitable company's internal control.

Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and
related disclosures made by the directors.

dentifying and testing journal entries.

Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and
whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair
presentation.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council's
website at www. fre.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our Report of the Independent Auditors.

Use of our report

This report is made solcly to the charitable company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies
Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the charitable company's members those matters we are
required to state to them in an auditors' report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or
assume responsibility to anyone other than the charitable company and the charitable company's members as a body, for our audit
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

GENERAL INFORMATION

First Rung Limited is a private company limited by guarantee incorporated in England and Wales. The registered office is
197 — 205 High Street, Ponders End, Enfield, EN3 4DZ. First Rung Limited is also a registered charity in England and
Wales. Charity number is 800614.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of preparing the financial statements

The financial statements of the charitable company, which is a public benefit entity under FRS 102, have been prepared in
accordance with the Charities SORP (FRS 102) ‘Accounting and Reporting by Charities: Statement of Recommended
Practice applicable to charities preparing their accounts in accordance with the Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the
UK and Republic of Ircland (FRS 102) (effective 1 January 2019)', Financial Reporting Standard 102 'The Financial
Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland’ and the Companies Act 2006. The financial statements
have been prepared under the historical cost convention.

Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty

In the application of the charity’s accounting policies, the Trustees are required to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates
and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual
results may differ from these estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised where the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the
revision and future periods where the revision affects both current and future periods. There were no critical accounting
estimates and judgements made in preparing these financial statements.

Going concern

At the time of approving the financial statements, the Trustees have a reasonable expectation that the charity has adequate
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. This view has been reinforced by First Rung’s ability
to maintain a positive cash balance, without recourse to borrowing. This position is strengthened by the continuation of our
existing ESFA funding contract until July 2024 and recent confirmation that the following year's contract until July 2025 will
show significant growth.

Income
All income is recognised in the Statement of Financial Activities once the charity has entitlement to the funds, it is probable
that the income will be received and the amount can be measured reliably.

Expenditure

Liabilities are recognised as expenditure as soon as there is a legal or constructive obligation committing the charity to that
expenditure, it is probable that a transfer of economic benefits will be required in settlement and the amount of the obligation
can be measured reliably. Expenditure is accounted for on an accruals basis and has been classified under headings that
aggregate all cost related to the category. Where costs cannot be directly attributed to particular headings they have been
allocated to activities on a basis consistent with the use of resources.

Government grants
The company recognises income arising from government grants using the performance model.

Tangible fixed assets and impairment of fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost, net of depreciation and any
impairment losses.

Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost of assets less their residual values over their useful lives on the
following bases:

Fixtures, fittings and equipment 20% Straight line

The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the sale proceeds and carrying
value of the asset, and is recognized in net income/(expenditure) for the year.

At each reporting end date, the charity reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible assets to determine whether there is any
indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the
asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any).

Taxation
The charity is exempt from corporation tax on its charitable activities.

Fund accounting
Unrestricted funds can be used in accordance with the charitable objectives at the discretion of the trustees.

Restricted funds can only be used for particular restricted purposes within the objects of the charity. Restrictions arise when
specified by the donor or when funds are raised for particular restricted purposes.

Pension costs and other post-retirement benefits
The charitable company operates a defined contribution pension scheme. Contributions payable to the charitable company’s
pension scheme are charged to the Statement of Financial Activities in the period to which they relate.

Payments in respect of other post-retirement benefits are charged to the Statement of Financial Activities in the period to
which they relate.

Employee benefits
The cost of any unused holiday entitlement is recognised in the period in which the employee's services are received.

Termination benefits are recognised immediately as an expense when the charity is demonstrably committed to terminate the
employment of an employee or to provide termination benefits.

Financial instruments
The charity has elected to apply the provisions of Section |] ‘Basic Financial Instruments’ and Section 12 ‘Other Financial
Instruments Issues’ of FRS 102 to all of its financial instruments.

Financial instruments are recognised in the charity’s balance sheet when the charity becomes party to the contractual
provisions of the instrument.

Financial assets and liabilities are offset, with the net amounts presented in the financial statements, when there is a legally
enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and
settle the liability simultaneously.

Basic financial assets

Basic financial assets, which include debtors and cash and bank balances, arc initially measured at transaction price including
transaction costs and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method unless the arrangement
constitutes a financing transaction, where the transaction is measured at the present value of the future receipts discounted at
a market rate of interest. Financial assets classified as receivable within one year are not amortised.

Financial instruments

Basic financial liabilities

Basic financial liabilities, including creditors are initially recognized at transaction price unless the arrangement constitutes a
financing transaction, where the debt instrument is measured at the present value of the future payments discounted at a
market rate of interest. Financial liabilitics classtficd as payable within one year are not amortised.

Debt instruments are subsequently carried at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.

Trade creditors are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of operations from
suppliers. Amounts payable are classified as current liabilitics if payment is due within one year or less. If not, they are
presented as non-current liabilities. Trade creditors are recognized initially at transaction price and subsequently measured at
amortised cost using the effective interest method.
