Accounting policies
Summary of significant accounting policies and key accounting estimates
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Statement of compliance
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102 Section 1A smaller entities - 'The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland' and the Companies Act 2006 (as applicable to companies subject to the small companies' regime).
Basis of preparation
These financial statements have been prepared using the historical cost convention except that as disclosed in the accounting policies certain items are shown at fair value.
The financial statements are prepared in pounds sterling, which is the functional currency of the company. Monetary amounts in these financial statements are rounded to the nearest £.
Group accounts not prepared
In the opinion of the directors, the company and its subsidiary undertakings comprise a small group. The company has therefore taken advantage of the exemption provided by Section 398 of the Companies Act 2006 not to prepare group accounts
.
Going concern
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. A period of twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements was considered. The directors have reasonable expectation that the company will continue in existence for the foreseeable future and therefore they consider that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis.

Audit report
The Independent Auditor's Report was unqualified.
The name of the Senior Statutory Auditor who signed the audit report on
20 December 2024
was
Benjamin Hayes BSc FCA
, who signed for and on behalf of
Wenn Townsend
.
Revenue recognition
Turnover comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the provision of subscriptions, training materials, and services in the ordinary course of the company’s activities. Turnover is shown net of sales/value added tax, returns, rebates and discounts.
The company recognises revenue when:
- the amount of revenue can be reliably measured;
- it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity; and
- specific criteria have been met for each of the company's activities.
Contract revenue recognition
Where a contract has only been partially completed at the balance sheet date turnover represents the value of the service provided to date on a proportion of the total expected consideration at completion.
Tax
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in profit or loss, except that a change attributable to an item of income or expense recognised as other comprehensive income is also recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
Current tax represents the amount of tax payable or receivable in respect of the taxable profit (or loss) for the current or past reporting periods.
It is measured at the amount expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax represents the future tax consequences of transactions and events recognised in the financial statements of current and previous periods.
It is recognised in respect of all timing differences, with certain exceptions.
Timing differences are differences between taxable profits and total comprehensive income as stated in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of income and expense in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements.
Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.
Deferred tax is measured using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date that are expected to apply to the reversal of timing differences.
Deferred tax on revalued non-depreciable tangible fixed assets and investment properties is measured using the rates and allowances that apply to the sale of the asset.

Tangible assets
Tangible assets are stated in the balance sheet at cost, less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses.
The cost of tangible assets includes directly attributable incremental costs incurred in their acquisition and installation.
Depreciation
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than land and properties under construction over their estimated useful lives, as follows:
Asset class
Depreciation method and rate
Office equipment
20-33% straight line
Motor vehicles
25% straight line
Investments
Investments in equity shares which are publicly traded or where the fair value can be measured reliably are initially measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss. Investments in equity shares which are not publicly traded and where fair value cannot be measured reliably are measured at cost less impairment.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and call deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value.
Trade debtors
Trade debtors are amounts due from customers for subscriptions or training materials sold or services performed in the ordinary course of business.
Trade debtors are recognised initially at the transaction price. A provision for the impairment of trade debtors is established when there is objective evidence that the company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
Trade creditors
Trade creditors are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if the company does not have an unconditional right, at the end of the reporting period, to defer settlement of the creditor for at least twelve months after the reporting date. If there is an unconditional right to defer settlement for at least twelve months after the reporting date, they are presented as non-current liabilities.
Trade creditors are recognised at the transaction price.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the company has an obligation at the reporting date as a result of a past event, it is probable that the company will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.

Defined contribution pension obligation
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which fixed contributions are paid into a pension fund and the company has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions even if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.
Contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as employee benefit expense when they are due. If contribution payments exceed the contribution due for service, the excess is recognised as a prepayment.
