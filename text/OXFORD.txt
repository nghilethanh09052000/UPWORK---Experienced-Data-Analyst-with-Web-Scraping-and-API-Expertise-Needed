Notes to the Abridged Financial Statements
Year ended 31 August 2024
1.
General information
The company is a private company limited by shares, registered in England and Wales. The address of the registered office is Ground Floor, 2 Compton Way, Witney, Oxon, OX28 5JX.
2.
Statement of compliance
These abridged financial statements have been prepared in compliance with Section 1A of FRS 102, 'The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and the Republic of Ireland'.
3.
Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The abridged financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, as modified by the revaluation of certain financial assets and liabilities and investment properties measured at fair value through profit or loss.
The abridged financial statements are prepared in sterling, which is the functional currency of the entity.
Disclosure exemptions
The entity satisfies the criteria of being a qualifying entity as defined in FRS 102. Advantage has been taken of the following disclosure exemptions available under paragraph 1.12 of FRS 102: (a) Disclosures in respect of each class of share capital have not been presented. (b) No cash flow statement has been presented for the company. (c) Disclosures in respect of financial instruments have not been presented. (d) Disclosures in respect of share-based payments have not been presented. (e) No disclosure has been given for the aggregate remuneration of key management personnel.
Revenue recognition
Turnover is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods supplied and services rendered, net of discounts and Value Added Tax. Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the buyer (usually on despatch of the goods); the amount of revenue can be measured reliably; it is probable that the associated economic benefits will flow to the entity; and the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transactions can be measured reliably.
Tangible assets
Tangible assets are initially recorded at cost, and subsequently stated at cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Any tangible assets carried at revalued amounts are recorded at the fair value at the date of revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses. An increase in the carrying amount of an asset as a result of a revaluation, is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity, except to the extent it reverses a revaluation decrease of the same asset previously recognised in profit or loss. A decrease in the carrying amount of an asset as a result of revaluation, is recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent of any previously recognised revaluation increase accumulated in equity in respect of that asset. Where a revaluation decrease exceeds the accumulated revaluation gains accumulated in equity in respect of that asset, the excess shall be recognised in profit or loss.
Depreciation
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost or valuation of an asset, less its residual value, over the useful economic life of that asset as follows:
Long leasehold property
-
10 years straight line
Plant & Machinery
-
5 years straight line
Fixtures, fittings and equipment
-
5 years straight line
Motor Vehicles
-
5 years straight line
Equipment
-
3 years straight line
Stocks
Stocks are measured at the lower of cost and estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell. Cost includes all costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the stock to its present location and condition.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the entity has an obligation at the reporting date as a result of a past event, it is probable that the entity will be required to transfer economic benefits in settlement and the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably. Provisions are recognised as a liability in the balance sheet and the amount of the provision as an expense. Provisions are initially measured at the best estimate of the amount required to settle the obligation at the reporting date and subsequently reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate of the amount that would be required to settle the obligation. Any adjustments to the amounts previously recognised are recognised in profit or loss unless the provision was originally recognised as part of the cost of an asset. When a provision is measured at the present value of the amount expected to be required to settle the obligation, the unwinding of the discount is recognised as a finance cost in profit or loss in the period it arises.
Defined contribution plans
Contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as an expense in the period in which the related service is provided. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that the prepayment will lead to a reduction in future payments or a cash refund. When contributions are not expected to be settled wholly within 12 months of the end of the reporting date in which the employees render the related service, the liability is measured on a discounted present value basis. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as a finance cost in profit or loss in the period in which it arises.

Employee numbers
