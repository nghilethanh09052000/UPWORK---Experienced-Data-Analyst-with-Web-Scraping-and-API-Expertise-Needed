2.5

Revenue

Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the
Company and the revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is measured as the fair value of the
consideration received or receivable, excluding discounts, rebates, value added tax and other sales
taxes. The following criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised:

Sale of goods

Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when all of the following conditions are satisfied: _
. the Company has transferred the significant risks and rewards of ownership to the buyer;

. the Company retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually
associated with ownership nor effective control over the goods sold;

° the amount of revenue can be measured reliably;

. it is probable that the Company will receive the consideration due under the transaction; and

. the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.

Rendering of services

Revenue from a contract to provide services is recognised in the period in which the services are
provided in accordance with the stage of completion of the contract when all of the following
conditions are satisfied:

° the amount of revenue can be measured reliably;

. it is probable that the Company will receive the consideration due under the contract;

. the stage of completion of the contract at the end of the reporting period can be measured
reliably; and

. the costs incurred and the costs to complete the contract can be measured reliably.

Finance costs

Finance costs are charged to profit or loss over the term of the debt using the effective interest
method so that the amount charged is at a constant rate on the carrying amount. Issue costs are
initially recognised as a reduction in the proceeds of the associated capital instrument.

Borrowing costs

All borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the year in which they are incurred.

Pensions
Defined contribution pension plan

The Company operates a defined contribution plan for its employees. A defined contribution plan is a
pension plan under which the Company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. Once the
contributions have been paid the Company has no further payment obligations.

The contributions are recognised as an expense in profit or loss when they fall due. Amounts not paid
are shown in accruals as a liability in the Balance sheet. The assets of the plan are held separately
from the Company in independently administered funds.

Current and deferred taxation

The tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in profit or loss
except that a charge attributable to an item of income and expense recognised as other
comprehensive income or to an item recognised directly in equity is also recognised in other
comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.

The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of tax rates and laws that have been
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date in the countries where the Company
operates and generates income.

Deferred tax balances are recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not
reversed by the balance sheet date, except that:

° The recognition of deferred tax assets is limited to the extent that it is probable that they will be
recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits; and

° Any deferred tax balances are reversed if and when all conditions for retaining associated tax
allowances have been met.

Deferred tax balances are not recognised in respect of permanent differences except in respect of
business combinations, when deferred tax is recognised on the differences between the fair values of
assets acquired and the future tax deductions available for them and the differences between the fair
values of liabilities acquired and the amount that will be assessed for tax. Deferred tax is determined
using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.

Intangible assets

Intangible assets are initially recognised at cost. After recognition, under the cost model, intangible
assets are measured at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment
losses.

All intangible assets are considered to have a finite useful life. If a reliable estimate of the useful life
cannot be made, the useful life shall not exceed ten years.

Tangible fixed assets

Tangible fixed assets under the cost model are stated at historical cost less accumulated
depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Historical cost includes expenditure that is
directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of
operating in the manner intended by management.

Accounting policies (continued)

2.9 Tangible fixed assets (continued)

Depreciation is charged so as to allocate the cost of assets less their residual value over their
estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method.

Depreciation is provided on the following basis:

Leasehold land and buildings = - 10% Straight line method
Plant and machinery - 20% Straight line method
Fixtures and fittings - 20% Straight line method
Office equipment ~ - 20% Straight line method
Website development - 20% Straight line method

The assets' residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted
prospectively if appropriate, or if there is an indication of a significant change since the last reporting
date.

Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount
and are recognised in profit or loss.

2.10 Debtors
Short-term debtors are measured at transaction price, less any impairment. Loans receivable are
measured initially at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are measured subsequently at amortised
cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment.

2.11 Cash and cash equivalents -
Cash is represented by cash in hand and deposits with financial institutions repayable without penalty
on notice of not more than 24 hours. Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments that mature in no
more than three months from the date of acquisition and that are readily convertible to known
amounts of cash with insignificant risk of change in value.

2.12 Creditors
Short-term creditors are measured at the transaction price. Other financial liabilities, including bank
loans, are measured initially at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are measured subsequently at
amortised cost using the effective interest method.

2.13 Provisions for liabilities

Provisions are recognised when an event has taken place that gives rise to a legal or constructive
obligation, a transfer of economic benefits is probable and a reliable estimate can be made.

Provisions are measured as the best estimate of the amount required to settle the obligation, taking
into account the related risks and uncertainties.

Increases in provisions are generally charged as an expense to profit or loss.
2.14 Financial instruments

The Company only enters into basic financial instrument transactions that result in the recognition of
financial assets and liabilities like trade and other debtors and creditors, loans from banks and other

third parties, loans to related parties and invetments in ordinary shares.

reporting period for objective evidence of impairment. !f objective evidence of impairment is found, an
impairment loss is recognised in the Statement of Income and Retained Earnings.

2.15 Dividends
Equity dividends are recognised when they become legally payable. Interim equity dividends are
recognised when paid. Final equity dividends are recognised when approved by the shareholders at
an annual general meeting.

The average monthly number of employees, including directors, during the year was 22 (2022 - 22).
