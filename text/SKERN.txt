STRATEGIC REPORT FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 OCTOBER 2023
The directors present their strategic report for Skern Lodge Limited (‘the company’) for the year ended 31 October 2023.
BUSINESS REVIEW AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS

The principal activity of the company is the provision of inspiring learning experiences for young people including
educational school trips and adventure breaks. The company is currently developing an increased focus on adult
education through the “Skern Training & Skills” brand, which is a provider of apprenticeship programmes and corporate
behavioural programmes.

During the year under review, the company achieved turnover of £2,327,000 (2022: £2,624,000). The comprehensive
profit for the financial year amounted to £425,000 (2022: £310,000). Operating profit for the year was £489,000 (2022:

The directors do not anticipate any material changes in the company's activities in the ensuing year.
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES AND KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS

The management of the business and the execution of the company's strategy are subject to a number of risks, the key
ones being set out below:

* Customer and market competition - the business engages in regular communication with its customers to establish
trends and ensure maximum customer satisfaction. Market competitors are recognised and monitored.

+ Major disaster - as with any business in this sector the company is exposed to external events such as fire, natural
disaster or infectious disease. A disaster recovery plan is in place and commercial insurances exist for any significant
business interruption or loss/damage.

+ Reputational risk - the business has a robust safeguarding and health and safety policy which is reviewed on a regular
basis to ensure it is fit for purpose. The company also employs a PR agency to manage image and brand awareness
within the industry.

+ Adequate financing and funding risk - the business is in regular communication with all shareholders and lenders to
assess future funding requiremenis. The business monitors cash flow and forward looking forecasts to ensure a clear
view of the coming events.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 OCTOBER 2023

The directors present their report and the financial statements for Skern Lodge Limited (‘the company’) for the year
ended 31 October 2023.

RESULTS AND DIVIDENDS

The profit for the year amounted to £425,000 (2022: £310,000). The directors have not recommended the payment
of a final dividend (2022: £nil).

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

The company's operations expose it to a variety of financial risks that include liquidity risk. Given the size of the
company the directors have not delegated the responsibility of monitoring financial risk management to a sub-
committee of the board. The policies set by the board of directors are implemented by the company's finance
department.

Liquidity risk

The company has access to funding from other group companies such as to ensure it is able to settle its debts as
they fall due.

Credit risk

Credit risk arises where counterparties are unable to meet their payment obligations. Due to the operational nature of
the Company's trading activities whereby the majority of sales are settled in advance, the Company has limited
exposure to credit risk.

DIRECTORS

The directors, who held office throughout the period and up to the date of signing the financial statements, were as
follows:

A Williamson
N Hales (resigned 7 March 2024)
| Champion (appointed / March 2024)

DIRECTORS’ AND OFFICERS’ INDEMNITY INSURANCE

The company maintains liability insurance for its directors and officers, with a cover limit for each claim or series of
claims against them in that capacity. The directors have also been granted a qualifying third party provision under
section 234 of the Companies Act 2006. Neither the company's indemnity nor insurance provides cover in the event
that a director is proved to have acted fraudulently or dishonestly.

EMPLOYEE INVOLVEMENT
Consultation with employees or their representatives has continued at all levels, with the aim of ensuring that their

views are taken into account when decisions are made that are likely to affect their interests and that all employees
are aware of the financial and economic performance of their business units and of the group as a whole.

EMPLOYMENT OF DISABLED PERSONS
The company has continued its policy regarding the employment of disabled persons. Full and fair cansideration is
given to applications for employment made by disabled persons having regard to their particular aptitude and abilities.

Appropriate training is arranged for disabled persons, including the retraining for alternative work of employees who
may become disabled, to promote their career development within the organisation.

Accounting Standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 102, “The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in
the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland” (“FRS 102”) and the Companies Act 2006.

3. ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The principal accounting policies applied to the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These
policies have been consistently applied to all of the years snown unless otherwise stated.

Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.

The preparation of financial statements requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires

involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the
financial statements, are disclosed in note 4.

The functional currency of Skern Lodge Limited is considered to be pounds sterling because that is the currency of the
primary economic environment in which the Company operates.

Going concern

The directors have prepared the financial statements for the company on the going concer basis. The directors have
performed a going concern assessment covering a period for at least twelve months from the date of approval of these
financial statements in order to assess going concern.

Having taken into account the operating risks and uncertainties, reviewed the trading and cash flow forecasts, and
reflected on the facilities available the directors believe that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a
going concern basis.

Exemptions for qualifying entities under FRS 102
In these financial statements, the company is considered to be a qualifying entity (for the purposes of this FRS) and
has applied the exemptions available under FRS 102 in respect of the following disclosures:

(i) from preparing a statement of cash flows, on the basis that it is a qualifying entity and its parent company, Graduation

paragraph 33.1;

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 OCTOBER 2023 (CONTINUED)

3. ACCOUNTING POLICIES — (CONTINUED)
Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at historic purchase cost less accumulated depreciation. Cost includes the original

purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use.

Depreciation
Depreciation is provided at the following annual rates in order to write off each asset over its estimated useful life.

Plant and machinery - 18% - 33% straight line

Motor vehicles - 25% on cost

Leasehold property - _ lower of the life of the tease or 50 years

Leasehold property improvements - lower of lease period or assets useful economic life

Freehold land is not depreciated.

Taxation

Taxation expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax recognised in the reporting period. Tax is
recognised in the statement of comprehensive income, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other
comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or
directly in equity respectively.

Current or deferred taxation assets and tiabilities are not discounted.

Current tax

Current tax is the amount of income tax payable in respect of the taxable profit for the year or prior years. Tax is
calculated on the basis of tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the period end.
Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax
regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to
be paid to the tax authorities.

Deferred tax

Deferred tax arises from timing differences that are differences between taxable profits and total comprehensive
income as stated in the financial statements. These timing differences arise from the inclusion of income and expenses
in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in financial statements.

Deferred tax is recognised on all timing differences at the reporting date. Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax
assets are only recognised when it is probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities
or other future taxable profits.

Deferred tax is measured using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the period end
and that are expected to apply to the reversal of the timing difference.

Stocks
Stocks are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value, after making due allowance for obsolete and slow
moving items.

Lease agreements
At inception the company assesses agreements that transfer the right to use assets. The assessment considers
whether the arrangement is, or contains, a lease based on the substance of the arrangement.

(i) Finance leases

Leases of assets that transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership are classified as finance
leases.

Finance leases are capitalised at commencement of the lease as assets at the fair value of the leased asset or, if
lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments calculated using the interest rate implicit in the lease. Where
the implicit rate cannot be determined the company's incremental borrowing rate is used. Incremental direct costs,
incurred in negotiating and arranging the lease, are included in the cost of the asset.

Assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful life of the asset. Assets are
assessed for impairment at each reporting date.

The capital elements of the leasing obligations is recorded as a liability on inception of the arrangement. The lease

payments are proportioned between capital repayment and finance charge, using the effective interest rate method,
to produce a constant rate of charge on the balance of the capital repayments outstanding.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 OCTOBER 2023 (CONTINUED)

3. ACCOUNTING POLICIES — (CONTINUED)

(ii) Sale and leaseback

Sale and leaseback transactions resuiting in a finance lease are accounted for in tine with the finance lease policy
above. Any excess of sales proceeds over the carrying amount are deferred and amortised over the lease term. Any
loss on disposal of the assets is recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income.

(iii) Operating leases

Leases that do not transfer all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as operating leases. Payments under
operating leases are charged to the statement of comprehensive income on a straightine basis over the period of the
lease,

Share capital

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares or
options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.

4. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY

Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors,
including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

The directors believe that the only key accounting estimate and assumption involved in applying the Company's
accounting policies is the assessment of useful economic life of tangible fixed assets.

The annual depreciation charge for tangible assets is sensitive to changes in the estimated useful economic lives and
residual values of the assets. The useful economic lives and residual values are re-assessed annually. They are

amended when necessary to reflect current estimates. See note 12 for the carrying amount of the tangible assets,
and note 3 for the useful economic lives for each class of assets.

has been calculated based on these rates, reflecting the expected timing of reversal of the related temporary

differences (2022: 25%).
