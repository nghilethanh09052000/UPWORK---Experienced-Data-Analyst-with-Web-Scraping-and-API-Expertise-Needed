CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023

It is a great pleasure to present the Institute of Export & International Trade’s annual Report and Accounts.
During what has been a difficult year for global trade the Institute has continued to increase membership,
improve and expand services to members, enhance its profile, increase member satisfaction and attract new
talent.

During the year the institute secured the respected Investors in People certification and was also honoured to
win the Investors in People Best People Team Award with the aim, during the process of reaccreditation, of
securing coveted Gold Standard status in 2024.

The year also witnessed the Institute earning recognition as a Disability Confident Employer and winning two
Peterborough Business Awards for Employer of the Year and Contribution to Business.

The Awards, along with securing SO 27001, 9001 and 14001 certification underline the Institute's continued
commitment to continuous improvement, innovation, operational excellence and staff welfare.

In 2023 The toE&IT Foundation completed its first full year as a standalone Charity. The main purpose of the
Charity is to improve the awareness and education of young people in the UK from the ages of 16-25 in the
positive benefits and importance to our nation of intemational trade by the provision of financial grants which
support educational initiatives in schools, colleges and universities.

Two major disbursements, in particular, were made to Young Enterprise and Scottish Enterprise enabling those
organisations to reach out to circa 100,000 young men and women and work with over 100 schools and 20
University and Further Education Colleges.

Individual Awards were also made at the Young Enterprise Start Up Finals and the Scottish Young Edge Finals
to students studying for the Institute's own Examination and Learning Modules.

The Foundation, under the leadership of our Vice Chair, Marcel Landau, can be proud of a busy and rewarding
first full year of operation.

In a year marked by global instability the Institute has demonstrated resilience and adaptability. Amidst the
challenges posed by geopolitical tensions and the lingering effects of the Covid pandemic the Board of Trustees
continue to review and refine the Institute's strategy and how best to focus on and support our members and
stakeholders.

A key element of the strategy is our aim to secure Chartered status which ! am delighted to report has now been
granted by His Majesty King Charles. The accolade is a tribute to the work of the Institute over the past 89 years
since it was established in 1935 and the excellent work, since he joined In 2020 of the Institute’s Director
General, Marco Forgione, and his executive team.

Membership also remains very much at the heart of our strategy and focus with significant progress having been
made in growing and engaging with the membership base around the country. A majer initiative during the year
was the setting up of three Special Interest Groups (SIGs) focusing, initially, on the food and drink and
manufacturing sectors and the challenging and often complicated area of Export Controls.

They have become important for knowledge sharing, problem solving and networking.

Other important initiatives include the ‘ABOVE & BEYOND’ campaign which attracted over one hundred
companies within two weeks of its faunch, the Import Export Show (IES) and the International Trade Awards
(ITA).

Investment also continued during the year to enhance the range of virtual and on-site training courses and
services and representing members and stakeholders at trade shows and events around the country.

(A Company Limited by Guarantee}

CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023

These initiatives along with the Institute's improved Business Helpline and Business Health Check Reports have
supported membership growth of 20% in corporate and professional members during the year and improved
member satisfaction rates.

Profile and engagement remain a key part of the Institute’s activity to help secure a stable global trading
environment for exporters and importers alike with the Institute at the forefront of key Governmental initiatives
such as the launch, with the Business and Trade Secretary of State Kemi Badinoch and Exports Minister
Malcolm Offord, of the E-Commerce Trade Commission, the BorderTarget Operating Mode! (BTOM) and the
extensive contribution to numerous reports, discussions and White Papers.

The Institute's media profile also increased considerably during the year with monthly Advertising Value
Equivalent exceeding £400k, commentary on a wide range of television, radio, print and on-line platforms and a
substantial increase of followers on social media platforms such as Linkedin and X (formerly Twitter).

The year was also a positive one for financial performance with income totalling £15.7m generating a surplus of
£1.4m. This result, along with unrestricted cash reserves of £25m underpins the Boards continued confidence to
be able to invest in the future, deliver enhanced services to members and continue our mission to support and
enhance fair and unrestricted global trade.

It remains for me, in closing, to thank our Director General, Marco Forgione, and his executive team, my fellow
Trustee Directors for their time and support and most of all our members, the lifeblood of the Institute, whom we
seek to serve.

Thank you.

charitable company’s assets if it should be wound up while he or she is a member of the company or within one
year of ceasing to be a member.

trade and has been successful in both of these areas.

Structure, Governance and Management (continued)

¢. Policies adopted for the Induction and training of Trustees

Trustees are inducted into the Charity with a special Board meeting after the AGM each year. Upon agreeing to
join the Board each member receives a welcome pack which carries the Articles of Association, Bye laws and
Charities Commission information about the role of a Trustee-Director. Meetings with the Senior Leadership
Team, engaging with staff and participating in a number of sub-committees pertinent to the strategic aims of the
Charity provide a full understanding of the Charity's objectives and the opportunity to influence future strategy.
Training is undertaken through Charity Commission updates and other relevant training.

d. Organisational structure and decision making

Executive Board of Directors and Trustees

The management of the affairs and business of the Charity is vested in the Board which consists of the
Trustee Directors who are also the Directors who are elected as outlined previously. The role of the Director
General Is to deliver all the policy and objective decisions and develop full business plans to ensure delivery of
these goals. The Academic Board is tasked with governance and management of education standards and will

Administrative
The Director General holds overall responsibility for administration and management and is supported by
Commercial Operations, Stakeholder Engagement and the CFO.

Task or Action groups

the old Special Interest groups. These groups form the basis of how the members meet and develop solutions to
the challenges faced by the variety of disciplines that fall under the auspices of international trade.

e, Risk Management

The Trustees regularly assess the major risks to which the Charity and the Group is exposed, in particular those
related to the operations and finances of the Charity and are satisfied that systems and procedures are in place
to mitigate our exposure to the major risks.

The Trustees consider that the principal risks and uncertainties of the Charity relate to reputational damage,
financial risk, and compliance failure. The Trustees have plans in place to mitigate these by regular review of the
external affairs activity via the Director General and Trustee Board meetings. Financial risks are regularly
reviewed by the Finance Committee and detalled reporting to the Trustee Board. The Charity uses sector
standard reporting processes, procedures and technologies. Clear limits are imposed on contractual
agreements, signing authorities and two factor signatories (one executive and one non-executive) are required
for any cash transfers and investments, Reserves are distributed and managed by regulated fund managers with
regular reviews,

progress is undertaken. A Nominations and Remunerations Committee oversees the appointment, pay and
conditions for all senior team members, this includes the Director General and his first-tier reports. The
committee works with an external advisor to ensure remuneration is reflective of market conditions.

TRUSTEES' REPORT (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023

STRATEGIC REPORT
Achievements and performance
a. Going Concern

On 21 December 2023 The Institute of Export and International Trade (IOE&IT) was awarded a Royal Charter by
HM King Charles, On this date, the Chartered Institute of Export and International Trade was created. For the
purposes of continuing the work of the charity and on 1 July 2024 all the assets and liabilities of the \OE&IT were
transferred to the Chartered Institute of Export and International Trade at book value, as a result of this the
lOE&IT ceased trading and will no longer be a going concern.

b. Review of Activities

The Charity's activities are divided into four main areas: education, training, membership, and profile wor

Education and Training

In 2023, the international trade landscape was disrupted by a number of challenges, the ongoing war in Ukraine,
ongoing geo-political tensions and the impact of conflict and environmental change on supply chains. The
Institute responded by conducting a comprehensive review of its services. This resulted in a refresh and
realignment of course content, leading to the introduction of new, targeted provisions. The Charity's efforts in
education were further strengthened by launching new training programs, providing a range of virtual and on-site
courses.

Membership and Profile

Member-specific services have been significantly enhanced, coupled with a more active member engagement
program. These initiatives have led to increased levels of member retention and recruitment. In 2023,
membership grew by 20%, driven by the establishment of three Special Interest Groups (SiGs) focused on
Export Controls, Food & Drink, and Manufacturing. The Charity’s outreach efforts and increasing profile have
resulted in membership numbers reaching 7,509 by the end of the year, an increase of 701 from the previous
year.

The Institute, in partnership with Maersk, expanded its offerings through the Global Customs Academy, building
on the success of the UK Customs Academy. Collaborations with institutions such as SERC in Northern Ireland
and {TC in Africa and Central Asia have significantly increased the Institute's reach and influence.

Continued investment in the membership team and member services has enhanced member engagement and
retention. Our proactive outreach and heightened profile have been pivotal in driving membership growth.

¢. Investment policy and performance

Article 15.2(z) empowers the Charity to invest monies not immediately required for its purposes in investments,
securities, or property as deemed fit, subject to legal conditions. During the year, the Trustees reviewed the
fixed-term deposits held by the Charity and allocated £12,000,000 into three investment funds aimed at providing
capital security and a competitive yield.

TRUSTEES' REPORT (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023

STRATEGIC REPORT (continued)

Financial review
a. Financial review

The year-end financial position is sound, with sustainable earnings performance and sufficient cash to fund
operations. The Charity has a robust pipeline of new opportunities, holding £2.3m in cash and liquid investments
at year-end (compared to £8.9m in 2022). Financial management has been enhanced by adopting a Risk
Register to identify and manage key risks. The Charity follows an Internal Financial Control Procedures
document based on the Charity Commission's guidance.

b. Reserves policy

The Reserves Policy remains unchanged, requiring maintenance of six months of operating expenses in cash to
cover unexpected expenses and funding fluctuations. At year-end, unrestricted reserves totaled £24.5m (up from
£23.1m in 2022), sufficient to meet this requirement and provide additional funds for reinvestment in the Charity.
Following a strategic review, the Finance Committee recommended a short-term investment approach using the
Insignis Platform to benefit from higher interest rates in FCA-insured accounts. The Board agreed on a
comprehensive reserves and investment strategy to ensure the effective use of resources in support of the
Charity’s objectives. This led to a decision to invest a portion of reserves in managed funds, with a process
established to select fund managers.

Plans for future periods

In early 2023, the Board reaffirmed a challenging five-year strategic plan, setting clear targets for revenue
generation, membership growth, and raising the Institute's profile. This ongoing transformation will require
investment in the team, technology, and international development. The strategic plan is closely linked to the
Charity’s mission, with plans to establish a separate Charitable Foundation to further support its objectives.

Partnerships and profile

The Charity has enhanced its reputation and profile with goverment departments, multinational organizations,
and funding agencies. Media and press coverage has increased significantly, reflecting the investment and
strategic plan established. The achievement of the Investors in People Bronze Award highlights the Institute's
commitment to professionalizing the IOE&IT team, fostering a leaming culture, and promoting continuous
improvement.

Fundraising
No external fundraising is undertaken by the Charity and no fundraisers are used. All fundraising internally is
monitored by the Trustees.

Indemnity insurance
The Charity maintains indemnity insurance for the Trustees, covering actions brought against them in their
personal capacity, excluding fraud or dishonesty.

Engagement with others

The Trustees have considered the impact of the Charity on the environment in which it operates and have regard
to the impact of decisions in the long term, relationships with suppliers, clients and others. They have noted the
need to act fairly and to consider the impact of the operations of the Charity.

STATEMENT OF TRUSTEES' RESPONSIBILITIES
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023

The Trustees (who are also the Directors of the Charity for the purposes of company law) are responsible for

Company law requires the Trustees to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under company law,
the Trustees must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair
view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Charity and of their incoming resources and application of
resources, including their income and expenditure, for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the
Trustees are required to:

select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently,

observe the methods and principles of the Charities SORP (FRS 102);

make judgments and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;

state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards (FRS 102) have been followed, subject to any material
departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements;

prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the
Group will continue in business. .

the Group and the Charity's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position
of the Group and the Charity and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF THE INSTITUTE OF EXPORT AND
INTERNATIONAL TRADE

Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of The Institute of Export and Intemational Trade (the ‘parent
charitable company) and its subsidiaries (the ‘group’) for the year ended 31 December 2023 which comprise the
Consolidated Statement of Financial Activities, the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Charity Balance Sheet, the
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows and the related notes, including significant accounting policies. The
financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom
Accounting Standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 102 ‘The Financlal Reporting Standard applicable
in the UK and Republic of ireland’ (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

{n our opinion the financial statements:

° give a true and fair view of the state of the Group's and of the parent charitable company’s affairs as at 31
December 2023 and of the Group's incoming resources and application of resources, including its income
and expenditure for the year then ended;

have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice; and

° have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2008.

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable
law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit
of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical
requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the United Kingdom, including the
Financial Reporting Council's Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in
accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Emphasis of matter - financial statements prepared on a basis other than going concern

We refer you to note 2.2 of the financial statements which explains that the Charity was awarded a Royal
Chartership, resulting in all assets and llabilities being transferred to a new entity, Chartered Institute of Export
and International Trade. Therefore, the Trustees do not consider it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis
of accounting in preparing these financial statements. Accordingly, the financial statements have been prepared
on a basis other than going concem as described in note 2.2. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this
matter.

Other information ©

The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report other than the financial
statements and our Auditor's Report thereon. The Trustees are responsible for the other information contained
within the Annual Report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and,
except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion
thereon. Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other
information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the
audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent
material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the
financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material
misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

. the information given in the Trustees’ Report including the Strategic Report for the financial year for which
the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.

the Trustees’ Report and the Strategic Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal
requirements.

course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the Trustees’ Report including the Strategic
Report

Matters on which we are required to report by exception

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which Companies Act 2006 requires
us to report to you if, in our opinion:

° the parent charitable company has not kept adequate and sufficient accounting records, or retums
adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or

the parent charitable company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and
retums; or

certain disclosures of Trustees’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or

Responsibilities of Trustees

As explained more fully in the Trustees’ Responsibilities Statement, the Trustees (who are also the directors of
the charitable company for the purposes of company law) are responsible for the preparation of the financial
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the
Trustees determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the Trustees are responsible for assessing the Group's and the parent
charitable company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going
concem and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Trustees either intend to liquidate the Group
or the parent charitable company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an Auditor's Report that includes our
opinion. Reasonable assurance Is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures
in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities,
including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting imegularities, including fraud is
detailed below:

. Enquiry of management and those charged with governance around actual and potential litigation and
claims;

Enquiry of entity staff to identify any instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations;

Performing audit work over the risk of management override of controls, including testing of joumal
entries and other adjustments for appropriateness, and reviewing accounting estimates for bias;
Reviewing minutes of meetings of those charged with governance; and

Reviewing financial statement disclosures and testing to supporting documentation to assess compliance
with applicable laws and regulations.

.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial

Reporting Council's website at: ywww.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our
Auditor's Report.

and the Charity Commission (Charity Registration Number: 266395).

The address of the registered office and principal place of operation are detailed on page 1.

The nature of the Charity’s operations and principal activities are that of promoting export and providing

Accounting policies

2.1

Basis of preparation of financial statements

The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Charities SORP (FRS 102) -
Accounting and Reporting by Charities: Statement of Recommended Practice applicable to Charities
preparing their accounts in accordance with the Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK
and Republic of Ireland (FRS 102), the Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and
Republic of Ireland (FRS 102) and the Companies Act 2008.

The Institute of Export and Intemational Trade meets the definition of a public benefit entity under
FRS 102. Assets and liabilities are initially recognised at historical cost or-transaction value unless
otherwise stated in the relevant accounting policy.

The financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling which is the functional currency of the
Group and amounts are rounded to the nearest Pound Sterting.

The Consolidated Statement of Financial Activites (SOFA) and Consolidated Balance Sheet
consolidate the financial statements of the Charity and its subsidiary undertaking. The results of the
subsidiary are consolidated on a line by line basis.

The Charity has taken advantage of the exemption allowed under section 408 of the Companies Act
2006 and has not presented its own Statement of Financial Activities in these financial statements.

The income and expenditure account for the year dealt with in the accounts of the Charity was a
surplus of £1,642,593 (2022 - £5,473,200).

The significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out
below. These policies have been applied consistently to all years presented unless otherwise stated.

Going concern

On 21 December 2023 The Institute of Export and Intemational Trade (IOE&IT) was awarded a Royal
Charter by HM King Charles. On this date, the Chartered Institute of Export and Intemational Trade
was created. For the purposes of continuing the work of the charity and on 1 July 2024 all the assets
and liabilities of the 1OE&IT were transferred to the Chartered Institute of Export and International
Trade at book value, as a result of this the IOE&IT ceased trading and will no longer be a going
concem.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023

Accounting policies (continued)

2.3 Income

All income is recognised once the Group has entitlement to the income, it is probable that the income
will be received and the amount of income receivable can be measured reliably.

Income from trading activities includes income eamed from membership, training and trading
activities to raise funds for the Group. Income is received in exchange for supplying goods and
services in order to raise funds and is recognised when entitlement has occurred.

Other income includes items such as gains on disposals of tangible fixed assets.

Education income is deferred in accordance with the Charity's policy. An initial 55% of the education
income is recognised at the start of the course, the remainder is deferred and released over the term
of the course. In accordance with the policy, an average term of 16 months is used, except for
foundation courses which are a defined 12 month term.

The membership income is deferred and released over the term of the membership.

The training course income received prior to the course being held is deferred and released when the
course is delivered.

Expenditure

All expenditure is accounted for on an accruals basis and has been classified under headings that
aggregate all costs related to the category. Expenditure is recognised where there is a legal or
constructive obligation to make payments to third parties, it is probable that the settlement will be
tequired and the amount of the obligation can be measured reliably. It is categorised under the
following headings:

+ Costs of raising funds includes the costs of providing training;
* Expenditure on charitable activities include memberships and education; and
+ Other expenditure represents those items not failing into the categories above.

Irrecoverable VAT is charged as an expense against the activity for which expenditure arose.

Expenditure on charitable activities is incurred on directly undertaking the activities which further the
Group's objectives, as well as any associated support costs.

Support costs allocation

Support costs are those that assist the work of the Group but do not directly represent charitable
activities and include office costs, governance costs, administrative, and payroll costs. They are
incurred directly in support of expenditure on the objects of the Group and include project
management carried out at Headquarters. Where support costs cannot be directly attributed to
particular headings they have been allocated to cost of raising funds and expenditure on charitable
activities on a basis consistent with use of the resources.

The analysis of these costs is included in Note 9.

2. Accounting policies (continued)

Foreign currencies

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at rates
of exchange ruling at the reporting date.

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rate ruling on the date of the
transaction.

Exchange gains and losses are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Activities.
Taxation

The Charity is considered to pass the tests set out In Paragraph 1 Schedule 6 of the Finance Act
2010 and therefore it meets the definition of a charitable company for UK corporation tax purposes.
Accordingly, the Charity is potentially exempt from taxation in respect of income or capital gains
received within categories covered by Chapter 3 Part 11 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 or Section
256 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, to the extent that such income or gains are
applied exclusively to charitable purposes.

In the year to 31 December 2023, IOEX Ltd, the trading subsidiary of the Charity, paid £NIL in
corporation tax, (2022 - ENIL).

Intangible assets and amortisation

Intangible assets are initially recognised at cost. After recognition, under the cost model, intangible
assets are measured at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment
losses.

Amortisation Is provided on intangible assets at rates calculated to write off the cost of each asset on
a straight-line basis over its expected useful life.

Amortisation is provided on the following bases:

Website development - 10 years on cost
Education development - 7 years on cost

2. Accounting policies (continued)

2.9 Tangible fixed assets and depreciation

Tangible fixed assets are initially recognised at cost. After recognition, under the cost model, tangible
fixed assets are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment
losses. All costs incurred to bring a tangible fixed asset into its intended working condition should be
included in the measurement of cost.

Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is charged so as to allocate the cost of tangible
fixed assets less their residual value over their estimated useful lives, using both the straight-line
method and the reducing balance basis.

Depreciation is provided on the following basis:

Freehold buildings - 2% on cost
Fixtures and fittings - 10% on cost
Office equipment - 25% on cost
Computer equipment - 33% on net book value
CRM database - 25% on cost

2.10 Investments

Fixed asset investments are a form of financial instrument and are initially recognised at thelr
transaction cost and subsequently measured at fair value at the Balance Sheet date, unless the value
cannot be measured reliably in which case It is measured at cost less impairment. Investment gains
and losses, whether realised or unrealised, are combined and presented as ‘Gains/(Losses) on
investments’ in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Activities.

Investments in subsidiaries are valued at cost less provision for impairment.
2.11 Debtors

Trade and other debtors are recognised at the settlement amount after any trade discount offered.
Prepayments are valued at the amount prepaid net of any trade discounts due.

2.12 Cash at bank and In hand

Cash at bank and in hand includes cash and short-term highly liquid investments with a short maturity
of three months or less from the date of acquisition or opening of the deposit or similar account.

2.13 Current asset investments

Current asset investments are represented by funds held on deposits that mature in more than three
months from the date of deposit but ultimately mature within one year of deposit. Interest earned
thereon is accrued over the period of the deposit and recognised in the Consolidated Statement of
Financial Activities.

2. Accounting policies (continued)

2.14 Liabilities and provisions

Liabilities are recognised when there is an obligation at the Balance Sheet date as a result of a past
event, it is probable that a transfer of economic benefit will be required in settlement, and the amount
of the settlement can be estimated reliably.

Liabilities are recognised at the amount that the Group anticipates it will pay to settle the debt or the
amount it has received as advanced payments for the goods or services it must provide.

Provisions are measured at the best estimate of the amounts required to settle the obfigation. Where
the effect of the time value of money is material, the provision is based on the present value of those
amounts, discounted at the pre-tax discount rate that reflects the risks specific to the liability. The
unwinding of the discount is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Activities as a
finance cost.

2.15 Financial instruments.

The Group only has financial assets and financial liabilities of a kind that qualify as basic financial
instruments. Basic financial instruments are initially recognised at transaction value and subsequently
measured at their settlement value with the exception of bank loans which are subsequently
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. .

2.16 Operating leases

Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to the Consolidated Statement of Financial
Activities on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

2.17 Pensions

When employees have rendered service to the Group, short-term employee benefits to which the
employees are entitled are recognised at the undiscounted amount expected to be paid in the
exchange for that service.

The Group operates a defined contribution pension plan for the benefit of its employees.
Contributions are expensed as they become payable.

2.18 Fund accounting

General funds are unrestricted funds which are available for use at the discretion of the Trustees in
furtherance of the general objectives of the Group and which have not been designated for other
purposes.

Designated funds comprise unrestricted funds that have been set aside by the Trustees for particular
purposes, The aim and use of each designated fund is set out in the notes to the financial
statements.

Critical accounting estimates and areas of judgment

Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other
factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances.

Critical accaunting estimates and assumptions:

The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates
and assumptions will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and
assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of
assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.

Critical areas of judgment:

Deferred income

Education income is deferred in accordance with the policy at 2.3. Judgement is required in determining
the percentage recognised at the start of each course and the amounts released over the remainder of the
course.

Cost allocation

Support costs are allocated to charitable activities. Judgment is required in determining the cost allocation
appropriate for each category.
