NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the financial year ended 31 July 2024
1. Accounting policies
The principal accounting policies are summarised below. They have all been applied consistently throughout the financial year and to the preceding financial year, unless otherwise stated.
General information and basis of accounting
South West Association of Training Providers Limited (the Company) is a private company, limited by guarantee, incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006 and is registered in England and Wales. The address of the Company's registered office is Goodwood House, Blackbrook Park Avenue, Taunton, TA1 2PX, United Kingdom.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, modified to include certain items at fair value, and in accordance with Section 1A of Financial Reporting Standard 102 (FRS 102) ‘The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland’ issued by the Financial Reporting Council and the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies subject to the small companies regime.
The financial statements are presented in pounds sterling which is the functional currency of the Company and rounded to the nearest £.
Turnover
Turnover comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable in respect of training contracts in the ordinary course of the company’s activities.
The company recognises revenue when: the amount of revenue can be reliably measured; it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity; and specific criteria have been met for each of the company's activities.
Interest income
Interest income is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Company and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably. Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset's net carrying amount on initial recognition.
Employee benefits
Defined contribution schemes
The Company operates a defined contribution scheme. The amount charged to the Profit and Loss Account in respect of pension costs and other post-retirement benefits is the contributions payable in the financial year. Differences between contributions payable in the financial year and contributions actually paid are included as either accruals or prepayments in the Balance Sheet.
Taxation
Current tax
Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recoverable) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date. Tax is recognised in the profit and loss account, except that a change attributable to an item of income or expense recognised as other comprehensive income is also recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax arises as a result of including items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in which they are included in the Company's financial statements. Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences which result in an obligation to pay more or less tax at a future date, at the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date that are expected to apply when the timing differences reverse. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and a valuation allowance is set up against deferred tax assets so that the net carrying amount equals the highest amount that is more likely than not to be recovered based on current or future taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are presented within provisions for liabilities on the balance sheet.
Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost or valuation, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment. The cost of tangible assets includes directly attributable incremental costs incurred in their acquisition and installation. Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets, other than investment property and freehold land, at rates calculated to write off the cost or valuation, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight-line or reducing balance basis over its expected useful life, as follows:

years straight line
Office equipment

years straight line
Residual value represents the estimated amount which would currently be obtained from disposal of an asset, after deducting estimated costs of disposal, if the asset were already of the age and in the condition expected at the end of its useful life.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying value of the asset, and is credited or charged to profit or loss.
Impairment of assets
Assets, other than those measured at fair value, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each Balance Sheet date. If there is objective evidence of impairment, an impairment loss is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account as described below.
Trade and other debtors
Trade and other debtors are initially recognised at fair value and thereafter stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method less impairment losses for bad and doubtful debts, except where the effect of discounting would be immaterial. In such cases the receivables are stated at cost less impairment losses for bad and doubtful debts.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are basic financial assets and include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in creditors: amounts falling due within one year.
Trade and other creditors
Trade and other creditors are initially recognised at fair value and thereafter stated at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, unless the effect of discounting would be immaterial, in which case they are stated at cost. If there is an unconditional right to defer settlement for at least twelve months after the reporting date, they are presented as non-current liabilities.
Government grants
Government grants are recognised based on the accrual model and are measured at the fair value of the asset received or receivable.
Grants are classified as relating either to revenue or to assets.
Grants relating to revenue are recognised in other operating income over the period in which the related costs are recognised, and timing differences are presented as other debtors or deferred income within the balance sheet. Grants relating to assets are recognised over the expected useful life of the asset. Where part of a grant relating to an asset is deferred, it is recognised as deferred income.
