DIRECTORS’ REPORT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2024

The directors present the strategic report for the year ended 31 March 2024.

Fair review of the business

Multiverse identifies, closes and prevents skills gaps, through personalized, on-the-job learning. Our principal activity
is the training and development of learners of all ages and backgrounds, while helping organisations embrace digital
transformation. We do this by deploying an Al-driven learning platform, alongside the best of human coaching. This
financial year has seen a particular acceleration in learning related to Artificial Intelligence, alongside our existing
strengths in tech and data skills.

FY24 was a year of transition for the business that saw a continuation of strong growth, delivered with increasing
efficiency, alongside a number of strategic investments. In particular:

e Revenue grew 29% year-on-year on a consolidated basis.

@ We've continued to improve our product with both internal investment and acquisitions. In addition to the
purchase of Peergrade (Eduflow), which impacts this year’s accounts, we purchased the assets of San
Francisco based Al firm Searchlight, to grow our skills intelligence capabilities. These investments have an
impact on EBITDA in this year, but positively affect our gross profit margin. Deploying technology effectively,
alongside improvements to our delivery model, has seen gross profit margin grow from 66% to 72%
year-on-year.

e Technological investment and the greater efficiencies that flow from them mean we've also continued to grow
our team, but at a more moderate rate than previous years. Headcount grew by 19%.

e During this year we made a number of changes to our US business to transition away from Registered
Apprenticeships. This included rightsizing our headcount, in order to make continued investments in that
market.

Future developments

The Group, together with the Board and senior leadership team, has developed a strategic plan for the business with
the specific focus of continual growth in our core UK market. Our Learning Product team work to ensure Multiverse is
able to close the most in demand skills gaps - already our core Artificial Intelligence programmes (Al Powered
Productivity and Al for Business Value), delivered approximately a third of our booked revenue in the UK.

We will continue to pursue the significant market opportunity in the US, alongside other regulated markets, globally.

Principal risks and uncertainties
The Directors assess the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group in both the short and long-term. They are
as follows:

People:

Our People are critical to our ability to run the business and provide a high-quality, differentiated product to our
customers. A key risk to Multiverse is ensuring we have the right number of skilled coaches to deliver our outstanding
training programmes without any compromise on quality.

Our stringent recruitment process seeks to bring exceptional talent into the team and is supported by a carefully
curated onboarding and training process for all employees. Our internal culture places strong emphasis on inspiring
and developing every team member throughout their time at Multiverse.

We also ensure we hire the right talent to our sales and marketing team to ensure strong delivery for our future
market growth.

We carefully select our Senior Leadership Team members to drive business growth and operational efficiency in all
aspects.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2024

Regulatory environment:

In our core UK business regulation has a meaningful impact. Thus far, our commitment to quality and regulatory
engagement has provided a competitive differentiation: we were the first apprenticeship provider of our size to
achieve Ofsted Outstanding judgements in our most recent inspection. We proactively engage and monitor the
regulatory landscape for potential updates, and invest in compliance across our organisation.

Currency risk:

The Group is exposed to currency risk by virtue of its proportion of business and staff members in the USA. The
Company maintains a USD account with proceeds from fundraises and US business operations. Held balances and
inflows from the continuing operations are more than sufficient for the medium term needs of the business, enabling
risk management.

Uncertain global economic environment:

The directors continue to review cash forecasts on a regular basis and ensure costs are kept under control and
continue to look ahead and mitigate further risks as they arise.

Key performance indicators
Multiverse monitors and measures its performance using both financial and non-financial metrics.

Received revenue represents the revenue recognised in the profit and loss account. Received revenue has grown
29% year-on-year.

The year-on-year decrease in cash is in part due to the impact of acquisitions. Our current ratio is strong at 4.5 as at
31 March 2024. The Group currently does not have any external financial debt.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2024

Directors Statement on Section 172

The Directors are responsible for promoting the long-term success of the Group by creating and maintaining

policy changes. The Group's key stakeholders include employees, customers, suppliers, shareholders and the
communities and environment in which the Group operates. The Board acknowledges its responsibilities under
Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 and below sets out the key considerations that demonstrates how the
directors discharge their duties: . ;

e The likely consequences of any decision in the long term:

The board meets on a quarterly basis with papers circulated in advance. This enables the directors to fully
understand the performance and position of the Company when making decisions of strategic importance.
When the Board is approving decisions, the requirements of Section 172 are considered and the potential
outcome of the decisions, including the impact on relevant stakeholder groups.

e The interest of the Group's employees:

The group relies on the skills, experience and commitment of our people to meet our business goals. The
Board aims to attract and retain high-quality employees, providing them with the right tools, development and
information to be effective in their roles.

e The need to foster the Group's business relationships with suppliers, customers, and others.

o Customers: The Group assesses, trains and develops apprentices for both corporate clients and’
the public sector. Feedback and retention rates from both apprentices and customers are regularly
reviewed, measured and considered.

o Suppliers: The Group works alongside suppliers to foster close working relationships.

o Shareholders: The Group engages with investors in the Company giving them a full understanding
of the business including the strategy, growth patential and rieke in tho business a3 well as the -
overall performance of the business.

e The impact of the Group's operations on the community and environment

The Group seeks to be a positive member of the communities in which it operates, and to operate in a
sustainable way. A key element of contributing to local communities is encouraging staff to spend an element
of work time supporting charitable projects of their choice. We publish the economic outcomes we generate
for individuals and society through a separate Impact Report. The Group also seeks to do what it reasonably

DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES STATEMENT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2024

The directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic Report, Directors' Report, the Statement of Corporate
Governance and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.

Company law requires the directors to prepare group and company financial statements for each financial year.
Under that law the directors have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under
company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true
and fair view of the state of affairs of the group and company, and of the profit or loss of the group for that period. In
preparing each of the group and company financial statements, the directors are required to:

e select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;

e® make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;

e state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards comprising FRS 102 have been followed, subject to any
material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements;

e prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the
group and company will continue in business.

The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the
group's and company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the
group and company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the group and company and hence for taking reasonable
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

STATEMENT OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND INTERNAL CONTROL
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2024

Statement of Corporate Governance

This Statement of Corporate Governance outlines the Group's corporate governance arrangements in accordance
with the requirements of the Office for Students (Ofs). This statement relates to the financial year ended 31 March
2024 and the period up to the date of approval of these financial statements.

Multiverse UK accredited higher education programmes (L4+) are subject to additional regulations in tine with the
apprenticeship regulations set out by the Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) and Multiverse Academic
Regulations are subject to annual monitoring and review. Responsibility for reviewing these Regulations lies with the
Multiverse Governance Team. Recommendations with regards to Academic Regulation are provided by the
Academic Quality Council and/or Quality Subcommittee which both meet quarterly. Each month, the Quality team
collates and reviews performance data across all programmes and identifies areas of emerging risk and
improvement. This report is surfaced to the Governance leadership and areas for urgent intervention are flagged and
escalated to the quarterly meeting.

Multiverse operates an Information Governance Committee which provides oversight and guidance on data
protection, privacy, and information security across the organisation. It ensures compliance with relevant regulations,
supports best practices in data management, and promotes a culture of accountability. The Committee reviews
policies, assesses risks, and advises on strategic initiatives to safeguard information while enabling efficient and
informed decision-making.

The wider overall governance of the organization rests with the Executive Team who are responsible for setting the
strategic direction, ensuring regulatory compliance, and upholding the organisation's values and objectives. There are
no other formal governing bodies or committees with specific governance responsibilities.

The group promotes transparency surrounding its corporate governance arrangements by providing key information
to stakeholders through its audited financial statements. The Articles of Association of Multiverse Group Limited are
also publicly available via Companies House. Further to these all policies are published on our website including our
academic regulations, quality assurance strategy, safeguarding policy, DEI policy and anti-corruption and bribery
policies.

Statement of Internal Control

This Statement of Internal Control outlines the group's arrangements for the prevention and detection of corruption,
fraud, bribery, and other irregularities, in accordance with the requirements set out by the Office for Students (OfS).
This statement relates to the financial year ended 31 March 2024 and up to the date of the approval of the financial
statements.

The group recognises the importance of maintaining a sound system of internal control. Arrangements for internal
control are designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve its strategic aims and objectives.
These arrangements are considered appropriate for the size and complexity of the organization. The group can
therefore only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance of effectiveness.

The key elements of the group’s system of internal control include the following:

e Identifying and managing risk is an ongoing process and the executive team meets weekly to assess
changes in risks applicable to Multiverse. The executive team has responsibility for operational planning and
management, risk management, financial planning, resource planning and management, managing
stakeholder relationships and legal obligations.

e Arisk-based approach to the design and implementation of internal control is used to evaluate the likelihood
and impact of business, operational, compliance and financial risks becoming a reality.

e The Executive committee has responsibility for approving the Group’s budget and ensures regularity and
propriety in the use of its public funding through regular reviews of financial results with variance reporting.

e@ The external auditor, RSM UK, improves the internal control improvement by providing an independent
opinion on our controls and processes and confirms that our financial statements provide a true and fair view
of the group financial position.

e Multiverse attained 1S027001 certification in October 2024. Multiverse uses this external certification to
augment and validate its internal control framework.

There are no significant internal contro! weaknesses or failures to report.

_ INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF MULTIVERSE GROUP LIMITED

Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of Multiverse Group Limited (the ‘parent company’) and its subsidiaries (the
‘group’) for the year ended 31 March 2024 which comprise the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the
consolidated statement of financial position, the company statement of financial position, the consolidated statement of
changes in equity, the company statement of changes in equity and the consolidated statement of cashflows and notes
to the financial statements, including significant accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that has been
applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 102 “The
Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Iretand” (United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice).

In our opinion, the financial statements:
give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 March 2024
and of the group’s loss for the year then ended;
have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice;
have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial
statements section of our report. We are independent of the group and parent company in accordance with the ethical
requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard,
and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Conclusions relating to going concern

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting
in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions
that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group’s or the parent company’s ability to continue as a
going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant
sections of this report.

Other.information

The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and
our auditor's report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise
explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially
inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit or otherwise appears to
be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required
to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the
work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to
report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.

11

Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which the
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and

the strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal
requirements. . :

Matters on which we are required to report by exception

In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the parent company and their environment obtained in
the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report.

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to
report to you if, in our opinion:
adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit
have not been received from branches not visited by us; or

the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or

Responsibilities of directors

As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 9, the directors are responsible for the
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal
control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the parent company's
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going
concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with
ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic
decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

The extent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud

Irregularities are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. The objectives of our audit are to obtain
sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding compliance with laws and regulations that have a direct effect on the
determination of material amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, to perform audit procedures to help
identify instances of non-compliance with other laws and regulations that may have a material effect on the financial
statements, and to respond appropriately to identified or suspected non-compliance with laws and regulations identified
during the audit.

In relation to fraud, the objectives of our audit are to identify and assess the risk of material misstatement of the financial
statements due to fraud, to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the assessed risks of material
misstatement due to fraud through designing and implementing appropriate responses and to respond appropriately to
fraud or suspected fraud identified during the audit.

However, it is the primary responsibility of management, with the oversight of those charged with governance, to ensure
that the entity's operations are conducted in accordance with the provisions of laws and regulations and for the
12

prevention and detection of fraud.

In identifying and assessing risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including fraud, the group audit
engagement team:
obtained an understanding of the nature of the industry and sector, including the legal and regulatory
frameworks that the group and parent company operates in and how the group and parent company are
complying with the legal and regulatory frameworks;
inquired of management, and those charged with governance, about their own identification and
assessment of the risks of irregularities, including any known actua!, suspected or alleged instances of
fraud;
discussed matters about non-compliance with laws and regulations and how fraud might occur including
assessment of how and where the financial statements may be susceptible to fraud.

As a result of these procedures we consider the most significant laws and regulations that have a direct impact on the
financial statements are FRS 102, the Companies Act 2006 and tax compliance regulations. We performed audit
procedures to detect non-compliances which may have a material impact on the financial statements which included
reviewing financial statement disclosures, inspecting correspondence with local tax authorities and evaluating advice
received from external tax advisors.

The most significant laws and regulations that have an indirect impact on the financial statements are those in relation to
General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) and Ofsted (Education and Inspections Act). We performed audit
procedures to inquire of management whether the group is in compliance with these law and regulations and inspected
correspondence with Ofsted and educational regulatory authorities.

The audit engagement team identified the risk of management override of controls and revenue recognition as the areas
where the financial statements were most susceptible to material misstatement due to fraud. Audit procedures
performed included but were not limited to testing manual journal entries and other adjustments and evaluating the
business rationale in relation to significant, unusual transactions and transactions entered into outside the normal course
of business and testing a sample of revenue transactions.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting
Council’s website at: http:/Awww.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities This description forms part of our auditor's report.

Use of our report

This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by
law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s

members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Company information and accounting policies

Company information

Multiverse Group Limited (“the company”) is a private company limited by shares and is registered and
incorporated in England and Wales. The registered office is 2 Eastbourne Terrace, 5th and 6th Floors,
London, W2 6LG.

The group consists of Multiverse Group Limited and all of its subsidiaries.

The company's and the group's principal activities and nature of its operations are disclosed in the Directors’
Report.

Accounting policies

Basis of preparation of financial statements

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 102 “The Financial Reporting
Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland” (“FRS 102”) and the requirements of the Companies
Act 2006, including the provisions of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and
Reports) Regulations 2008.

The financial statements are prepared in sterling, which is the functional currency of the company. Monetary
amounts in these financial statements are rounded to the nearest £.

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention. The principal accounting
Policies adopted are set out below. ,

The company is a qualifying entity for the purposes of FRS 102, being a member of a group where the parent
of that group prepares publicly available consolidated financial statements, including this company, which are
intended to give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the group.
The company has therefore taken advantage of exemptions from the following disclosure requirements for
parent company information presented within the consolidated financial statements:

- Section 7 ‘Statement of Cash Flows’: Presentation of a statement of cash flow and related notes and
disclosures.

Basis of consolidation

The consolidated financial statements incorporate those of Multiverse Group Limited and all of its subsidiaries
(i.e. entities that the group controls through its power to govern the financial and operating policies so as to
obtain economic benefits). Subsidiaries acquired during the year are consolidated using the purchase method.
Their results are incorporated from the date that control passes.

All financial statements are made up to 31 March 2024. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the
financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by other
members of the group.

All intra-group transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies are
eliminated on consolidation. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of
an impairment of the asset transferred.

The cost of a business combination is the fair value at the acquisition date of the assets given, equity
instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed, plus costs directly attributable to the business
combination. The excess of the cost of a business combination over the fair value of the identifiable assets,
liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired is recognised as goodwill.

The cost of the combination includes the estimated amount of contingent consideration that is probable and
can be measured reliably, and is adjusted for changes in contingent consideration after the acquisition date

MULTIVERSE GROUP LIMITED
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2024

1 Company information and accounting policies (Continued)

Going concern

The directors review their forecasts with specific reference to the ability of the business to meet its liabilities
when they fall due and have reasonable expectation that the company is able to manage its business risks
successfully. The forecasts cover the twelve months from the date of signing of these financial statements and
make allowance for reasonable foreseeable impacts of the current economic environment.

The Group has net assets of £130,964,804 (2023 restated: £180,401,775 and cash balances of £135,353,536
(2023: £188,099,798) at the balance sheet date respectively.

Multiverse forecasts contain sufficient cash projections to enable continued growth and development of the
business. The forecasts cover the period beyond the twelve months from the date of signing of these
accounts. The directors have also considered various scenarios to stress test this forecast and as a result, the
directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing these accounts.

Turnover

In the UK, the majority of revenue comes from levy-funding apprenticeship programmes, whilst in the US
revenue is derived from commercial contracts for the supply of training and other services. Turnover is
recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for services provided in the normal
course of business, and is shown net of VAT, other sales related taxes and discounts.

Interest
Interest payable or receivable is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income over the terms of the
debt using the effective interest rate method.

Intangible assets other than goodwill

Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are recognised at cost and are subsequently measured
at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.

Amortisation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over their
useful lives on the following basis:

Website costs Straight line over two years
Computer software Straight line over ten years
Acquired brand names Straight tine over two years
Acquired technology Straight tine over five years
Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business combination over the fair value of the group's share
of the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill on acquisitions of
subsidiaries is included in ‘intangible assets’. .

Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill
amortisation is calculated by applying the straight-line method to its estimated useful life. If a reliable estimate
cannot be made, the useful life of goodwill is presumed to be 10 years. Goodwill is being amortised to
‘administrative expenses’ over 5 years.

Estimates of the useful economic life of goodwill are based on a variety of factors such as the expected use of
the acquired business, the expected useful life of the cash generating units to which the goodwill is attributed,
any legal, regulatory or contractual provisions that can limit useful life and assumptions that market participants
would consider in respect of similar businesses.

Goodwill is assessed for impairment when there are indicators of impairment and any impairment is charged to
the income statement. No reversals of impairment are recognised.

Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets purchased individually for more than £5,000 are initially measured at cost and subsequently
measured at cost or valuation, net of depreciation and any impairment losses.

21

MULTIVERSE GROUP LIMITED
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2024

1 Company information and accounting policies (Continued)

Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over their
useful lives on the following basis:

Leasehold land and buildings Straight line over five years
Plant and equipment Straight line over three years

The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the sale proceeds
and the carrying value of the asset, and is credited or charged to profit or loss.

In determining whether there are indicators of impairment of the Group's tangible assets, factors taken into
consideration include the economic viability and expected future financial performance of the assets.

Fixed asset investments

In the separate accounts of the company, interests in subsidiaries are initially measured at cost and
subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. The investments are assessed for
impairment at each reporting date and any impairment losses or reversals of impairment losses are
recognised immediately in profit or loss.

A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the group. Control is the power to govern the financial and operating
policies of the entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.

Impairment of fixed assets

At each reporting period end date, the group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible
assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any
such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the
impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset,
the company estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.

The carrying amount of the investments accounted for using the equity method is tested for impairment as a
single asset. Any goodwill included in the carrying amount of the investment is not tested separately for
impairment.

Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use,
the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the
estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.

lf the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying
amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An
impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued
amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents are basic financial instruments and include cash in hand and deposits held at call
with banks.

Financial instruments

The group has elected to apply the provisions of Section 11 ‘Basic Financial Instruments’ and Section 12
‘Other Financial Instruments Issues’ of FRS 102 to all of its financial instruments.

Financial instruments are recognised when the group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the
instrument.

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amounts presented in the financial statements when
there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net
basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

22

MULTIVERSE GROUP LIMITED
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2024

1 Company information and accounting policies (Continued)

Basic financial assets

Basic financial assets, which include trade and other debtors, amounts owed from fellow group undertakings
and cash and bank balances, are initially measured at transaction price including transaction costs and are
subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method unless the arrangement constitutes
a financing transaction, where the financial asset is measured at the present value of the future receipts
discounted at a market rate of interest. :

Impairment of financial assets

Financial assets are derecognised only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or
are settled, or when the group transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership to another entity, or if some significant risks and rewards of ownership are retained but control of
the asset has transferred to another party that is able to sell the asset in its entirety to an unrelated third party.

Derecognition of financial assets
Financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each reporting end date.

Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that
occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows have been affected.
If an asset is impaired, the impairment loss is the difference between the carrying amount and the present
value of the estimated cash flows discounted at the asset's original effective interest rate. The impairment loss
is recognised in profit or loss.

If there is a decrease in the impairment loss arising from an event occurring after the impairment was
recognised, the impairment is reversed. The reversal is such that the current carrying amount does not
exceed what the carrying amount would have been, had the impairment not previously been recognised. The
impairment reversal is recognised in profit or loss.

Classification of financial liabilities
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual
arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the
assets of the group after deducting all of its liabilities.

Basic financial liabilities

Basic financial liabilities, including trade and other creditors, and amounts due to group companies, are
initially recognised at transaction price unless the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where the
debt instrument is measured at the present value .of the future payments discounted at a market rate of
interest. Financial liabilities classified as payable within one year are not amortised.

Debt instruments are subsequently carried at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.

Derecognition of financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are derecognised when, and only when, the group's contractual obligations are discharged,
cancelled, or they expire.

Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the group are recorded at the fair value of proceeds received, net of transaction
costs.

Current and deferred taxation
Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year. Current tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax
rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.

Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised
or the liability is settled based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting
date.

23

MULTIVERSE GROUP LIMITED
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2024

1 Company information and accounting policies (Continued)

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised in respect of all timing differences that exist at the reporting date. Timing
differences are differences between taxable profits and total comprehensive income that arise from the
inclusion of income and expenses in tax assessments in different periods from their recognition in the financial
statements. Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered
by the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.

Deferred tax is recognised on income and expenses from subsidiaries that will be assessed to or allow for tax
in a future period except where the group is able to control the reversal of the timing difference and it is
probable that the timing difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the value of assets (other than goodwill) and liabilities
recognised in a business combination and the amounts that can be deducted or assessed for tax. The
deferred tax recognised is adjusted against goodwill.

Employee benefits
The costs of short-term employee benefits are recognised as a liability and an expense.

The cost of any unused holiday entitlement is recognised in the period in which the employee's services are
received.

Retirement benefits

For defined contribution schemes the amount charged to profit or loss is the contributions payable in the year.
Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown as either
accruals or prepayments.

Share-based payments

Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant by reference to the fair
value of the equity instruments granted using the Black-Scholes model. The fair value determined at the grant
date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the estimate of shares that will
eventually vest. A corresponding adjustment is made to equity.

The expense in relation to options over the parent company’s shares granted to employees of a subsidiary is
recognised by the company as an intercompany loan between the parent company and the receiving
subsidiary.

When the terms and conditions of equity-settled share-based payments at the time they were granted are
subsequently modified, the fair value of the share-based payment under the original terms and conditions and
under the modified terms and conditions are both determined at the date of the modification. Any excess of
the modified fair value over the original fair value is recognised over the remaining vesting period in addition to
the grant date fair value of the original share-based payment. The share-based payment expense is not
adjusted if the modified fair value is less than the original fair value.

Leases

Rentals payable under operating leases, including any lease incentives received, are charged to profit or loss
on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease except where another more systematic basis is
more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed.

Foreign exchange

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the spot exchange rates at the
dates of the transactions.

At each period end foreign currency monetary items are translated using the closing rate. Non-monetary items
measured at historical costs are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction and
non-monetary items measured at fair value are measured using the exchange rate when fair value was
determined.

24

‘MULTIVERSE GROUP LIMITED
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2024

1 Company information and accounting policies (Continued)

Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of transactions and from the translation at
period-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are
recognised in profit or loss when deferred in other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges.

Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings and cash and cash equivalents are presented in
the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income within "finance income or costs”. All other foreign
exchange gains and losses are presented in profit or loss within "other operating income” .

On consolidation, the results of overseas operations are translated into Sterling at rate approximating to those
ruling when the transactions took place. All assets and liabilities of overseas operations are translated at the
rate ruling at the reporting date. Exchange differences arising on translating the opening net assets at opening
tate and the results of overseas operations at actual rate are recognised in other comprehensive income.

2 Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty

In the application of the group’s accounting policies, the directors are required to make judgements, estimates
and assumptions about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that
are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

In preparing these financial statements, the directors have made the following judgements:

Impairment assessment on group balances. A review of potential impairment is conducted annually on
recoverability of group balances based on management's best estimate of future cash flows of the subsidiary
and its available cash funding.

Impairment of investment at a company level. Annually, the Company considers whether its investment in
subsidiaries is impaired. Where an indication of impairment is identified the estimation of recoverable value
requires estimation.

Share-based payments. Determining appropriate valuation for share-based payments, including options,

involves significant judgment, including expected volatility and estimated employee turnover rates in the

future: The Group adopts a Black-scholes valuation model to value for'Share-based payment transactions.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting
estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised where the revision affects only that
period, or in the period of the revision and future periods where the revision affects both current and future
periods

Prior year adjustments

a) In the current year, the Group reviewed its existing transfer pricing policy between Multiverse Group Limited (the Company) and Multiverse US, Inc. While these transfer
pricing agreements do not have an impact at the consolidated level of the financial statements, the review with our tax specialists identified that invoices had not been
raised for prior year recharges.

A VAT liability has arisen due to VAT under the reverse charge mechanism not being recoverable in full due to the Company's partly exempt status . The under provision
has been corrected by restating each of the materially affected financial statement line items for prior periods. The table below summarises the impact of these
adjustments on the Group's consolidated financial statements and the Company's financial statements.

b) In the prior year, the Group's shared-based payment charge was not included. Upon recalculation in the current year, it has been determined that charge was required.
The table below summarises the impact of this change on the Group's consolidated financial statements and the Company's financial statements.

All directors are remunerated through the company. Euan Blair has been the CEO of Multiverse for the
entirety of the current financial year. Under the OfS Accounts Diction he is the registered head of provider
and was also the highest paid director in 2024.

Ratio of head of provider pay against median pay of all staff 2024

Basic pay multiple 3.8
Total pay multiple 3.8
Notes

The methodology used in this calculation has been that provided by the OfS Accounts Direction. For both
the head of institution and whole workforce, the method has been applied consistently. The pay multiples
are calculated by comparing the head of institution pay with the median pay of the workforce across two

dimensions — basic pay and total pay. Median pay is calculated on a full-time equivalent basis for all staff.

' Head of provider pay

The head of provider’s pay is determined by the Board of Directors who consider the company’s position
as a scale-up technology company, benchmarked against CEOs of equivalent organisations at similar
scale.

Performance is assessed through regular Board meetings against KPls set by Board Members and
informed by the company’s work - as a minimum these typically cover revenue growth, and gross margin.

7 ~~ Share-based payment transactions

The group operates three share-based payment schemes for its employees:

- Approved EMI share option scheme
- All-employee share option scheme
- Unapproved share option scheme

Under these schemes, employees are granted options to purchase shares in the company. On
exercise of the options by the employees, the Company issues new ordinary shares. Majority of the
options granted have a vesting schedule being 25% of the option shares vesting 12 months from the
employee's start date and the remaining 75% in equal monthly tranches for the following 36 months.
Vesting of options for the all-employee scheme is subject to continued employment with the group.

All schemes

A reconciliation of share option movements over the year to 31 March 2024 is shown below.
Comparatives for the year to 31 March 2023 have also been shown and adjusted for per note 3.

The fair value of the share options granted during the year is determined using the Black-Scholes
method to calculate the fair value of the options during the reporting period. The model is
internationally recognised as being appropriate to value employee share schemes similar to those
operated by the group.

The total charge for the year was £3,404,863 (2023: £1,280,645).

The company has unutilised tax losses of £33,864,219 (2023: £18,372,194) as at 31st March 2024, which
are available to offset against future taxable profits. A deferred tax asset of £8,466,055 (2023 restated:
£4,593,048) (calculated at the applicable tax rate of 25%) has not been recognised in the financial
statements as there is currently insufficient certainty over the availability of future taxable profits against
which these losses can be utilised.

The unrecognised tax losses do not have an expiry date and may be carried forward indefinitely under
current tax legislation. The company will continue to assess the recoverability of these losses and
recognise a deferred tax asset if future taxable profi its become probable.

The total tax charge for the year included in the income statement can be reconciled to the loss before tax
multiplied by the standard rate of tax as follows:
