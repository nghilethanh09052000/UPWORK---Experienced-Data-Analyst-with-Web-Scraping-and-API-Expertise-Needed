The principal accounting policies are summarised below. They have all been applicd consistently throughout

currency of the primary economic environment in which the company operates.

Limited. a company incorporated in England and Wales, in which the company’s financial statements for
the year ended 31 December 2023 are consolidated.

Limited's wholly-owned subsidiaries.

Consolidated financial statements

requirement to do so under Section 400 of the companies Act 2006.

Going concern

The Group. of which the Company is part, has sufficient financial resources, together with contracts with a
large number of customers across di ferent industries. As aconsequence, the directors believe that the Group
s Well placed to manage its busin iccessfully. The directors have undertaken a rigorous as:

Notes to the financial statements (continued)
For the year ended 31 December 2023

L. Accounting policies (continued)

All financial assets and liabilities are initially measured at transaction price {including transaction costs),
except for those financial assets classified as at fair value through profit or loss. which are initially measured
at fair value (which is normally the transaction price excluding transaction costs). unless the arrangement
constitutes a financing transaction. If an arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, the financial asset
or financial liability is measured at the preseat value of the future payments discounted at a market rate of
interest for a similar debt instrument.

Financial assets and liabilities are only offset in the balance sheet when. and only when there exists a legally
enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and the company intends either to settle on a net basis,
or to realise the assct and settle the liability simultaneously.

Debt instruments that comply with all of the condition of paragraph 11.9 of FRS 102 are classified as ‘basic’.
For debt instruments that do not meet the conditions of FRS 102.11.9, the company considers whether the
debt instrument is consistent with the principle in paragraph 11.94 of FRS 102 in order to determine whether
it can be classified as basic. Instruments classified as ‘basic’ financial instruments are measured
subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Debt instruments that have no stated
interest rate (and do not constitute financing transaction) and are classified as payable or recetvable within
one year are initially measured at an undiscounted amount of the cash or other consideration expected to be
paid or received, net of impairment.

With the exception of some hedging instruments, other debt instruments not meeting conditions of being
“basic’ financial instruments are measured at fair value through profit or loss.

Commitments to make and receive loans which meet the conditions mentioned above are measured at cust
(which may be nil) less impairment.

Financial assets are derecognised when and only when a) the contractual rights to the cash flows from the
financial asset expire or are settled, b) the company transfers to another party substantially all of the risks
and rewards of ownership of the financial asset. or ¢) the company, despite having retained some, but not
all. significant risks and rewards of ownership, has transferred control of the asset to another party.
Financial Habilities are derecognised only when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged.
cancelled or expires.

Where the contractual terms of share capital do not have any terms meeting the definition of a financial
liability, then this is classed as an equity instrument. Dividends and distributions relating to equity
instruments are debited direct to equity.

Interest-bearing loans and borrowings

All interest-bearing loans and borrowings are initially recognised at net proceeds, After initial recognition
debt is increased by the finance cost in respect of the reporting period and reduced by repayments made in
the period.

Finance costs of debt are allocated over the term of the debt at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
Revenue recognition

Turnover represents the amounts derived from the provision of goods and services which fall within the
Company's ordinary activities, stated net of value added tax.

Taxation

Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or
recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet
date.

A provision is recognised for those matters for which the tax determination is uncertain but it is considered
probable that there will be a future outflow of funds to a tax authority. The provisions are measured at the
best estimate of the amount expected to become payable. The assessment is based on the judgement of tax
professionals within the Group supported by previous experience in respect of such activities and in certain

1. Accounting policies (continued)

professionals within the Group supported by previous experience in respect of such activities and in
certain cases based on specialist independent tax advice.

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the
balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or
a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date. Timing differences are
differences between the Group’s taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements that arise
from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are
recognised in the financial statements.

Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that, on the basis of all
available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from
which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.

When the amount that can be deducted for tax for an asset that is recognised in a business combination is
less (more) than the value at which it is recognised, a deferred tax liability (asset) is recognised for the
additional tax that will be paid (avoided) in respect of that difference. Similarly, a deferred tax asset
(liability) is recognised for the additional tax that will be avoided (paid) because of a difference between the
value at which a liability is recognised and the amount that will be assessed for tax.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for timing differences arising from investments in subsidiaries and
associates, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the timing difference and it is probable
that it will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Deferred tax is measured using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the
balance sheet date that are expected to apply to the reversal of the timing difference. Deferred tax relating
to property, plant and equipment measured using the revaluation model and investment property is measured
using the tax rates and allowances that apply to sale of the asset.

Where items recognised in other comprehensive income or equity are chargeable to or deductible for tax
purposes, the resulting current or deferred tax expense or income is presented in the same component of
comprehensive income or equity as the transaction or other event that resulted in the tax expense or income.

Current tax assets and liabilities are offset only when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the
amounts and the Group intends either to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability
simultaneously.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only if: a) the Group has a legally enforceable right to set off
current tax assets against current tax liabilities; and b) the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities
relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different
taxable entities which intend either to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis. or to realise the
assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred
tax liabilities or assets are expected to be settled or recovered.

Pensions
Contributions to defined contribution schemes are recognised in the Profit and loss account in the period in
which they become payable.

Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are measured at cost less impairment.
Related party transactions

In accordance with Section 33 of FRS 102, the Company has not disclosed details of transactions with fellow
wholly owned undertakings within the ANS Group Holdings Limited group of companies.
