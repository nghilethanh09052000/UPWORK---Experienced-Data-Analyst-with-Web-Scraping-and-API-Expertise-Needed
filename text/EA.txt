The Group profits for the year after taxation amounted to £4,299,000 (2023: £1,689,000 profit). The
directors do not recommend the payment of a dividend.

Group turnover from continuing activities increased by 59% (2023: 54% increase).

Group Operating Profit from continuing operations for the year was £5,315,000 (2023: £2,138,000 profit).
The Group has made the strategic decision to invest in development and innovation to enable it to provide
innovative high value-added offerings to customers in the future.

Employment costs increased by 34% (2023: 17% increase). Group turnover per employee increased by
59% (2023: 46% increase) to £189,000 (2023: £139,000).

more efficiently, with fewer failures and outages, greater safety, and lower costs. We are also developing
new network visibility propositions to support network operators in facilitating decarbonization.

Our investment is guided by a deep understanding of our customers’ business drivers, many of which are
subject to regulatory controls demanding flexible, timely, and cost-effective solutions.

The directors are committed to developing the Group in line with its key values: Integrity, Collaboration,
Contribution, Creativity, and Fairness.

Strategic report

As a leading smart grid specialist, the Group is involved at various levels in advocating for low carbon
solutions. We lead by example, having decarbonized our premises and supporting staff, local community
groups, and organizations focused on the net-zero agenda through financial contributions and resources

Business environment and outlook and future developments

The global market for our propositions remains very attractive. The UK is increasingly recognized as
leading the world in its development of grid technologies. As we are increasingly leading in this
marketplace, our potential for international growth is significant. We continue to reflect and review the
performance in our territories. The drivers in the UK continue to be regulatory, for our major customers.
The requirement for 100% network visibility as well as continued improvement in network reliability, both
create demand for our excellence in delivering innovative technologies in this space, recently recognized
with a King’s Award for Enterprise: Innovation.

The Group's revenues increased by nearly 60% in FY24 compared to FY23, driven by the scaling up of
some of our core monitoring technologies. Our sales pipeline indicates further revenue growth in FY25,
during which we will continue to invest in our people, our product development and in developing further
our international footprint.

Sustainable growth depends on retaining and recruiting high-calibre staff. We continue to offer attractive,
flexible packages and continue to attract outstanding individuals.

In October 2024 the company was acquired by Summa Equity. In addition, Summa Equity have also
invested an additional £7.5m in development capital to facilitate continued growth, aiming to expand our
geographic footprint and propositions in a market with significant growth potential.

Post balance sheet events
On 8 October 2024 the company was acquired by Summa Equity. Summa have also invested £7.5m

additional capital development capital into the company. The company’s activities were unaffected by the
acquisition and the company will continue to trade on the same basis for the foreseeable future.

Strategic report

Principal risks and uncertainties

Key challenges and risks, together with mitigation activities include the following:

Recruitment and retention of engineering talent: We seek to retain and recruit high-calibre staff
globally, maintaining strong relationships with higher education institutions and industry
associations,

Increased nationalisation globally is creating some negative forces against decarbonisation and a
tendency to use indigenous suppliers. Our technological lead and local support teams mitigate
these risks and our solutions bring cost reductions and operational efficiencies beyond the
decarbonisation agenda.

Supply chain and component shortages: We are increasing stock levels, investing in procurement
resources, and redesigning equipment to address component sourcing challenges. These risk are
subsiding compared to previous years.

Increased competition: Investment in development aims to maintain our position as a leading
supplier of technology and consultancy to the power distribution industry.

Protection of intellectual property: Steps are being taken to secure rights to protect income
streams.

Data and cyber security: The risk of data loss is increasing. The company has achieved ISO27001
accreditation and conducts regular penetration testing

Independent auditor's report to the members of
EA Technology Limited

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF EA TECHNOLOGY
LIMITED

Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of EA Technology Limited (the ‘parent company’) and its

subsidiaries (the 'group’) for the year ended 31 March 2024, which comprise the consolidated income

statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of financial

position, the company statement of financial position, the consolidated cash flow statement, the

consolidated statement of changes in equity, the company statement of changes in equity and notes to the

financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. The financial reporting

framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting

Standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 102 ‘The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the

UK and Republic of Ireland’ United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

In our opinion:

the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the group's and the parent company's
affairs as at 31 March 2024 and of the group's profit for the year then ended;

© the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice; and

© the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act
2006.

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) ISAs (UK) and
applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the ‘Auditor’s
responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements’ section of our report. We are independent of the
group and the parent company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of
the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other
ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Conclusions relating to going concern

We are responsible for concluding on the appropriateness of the directors’ use of the going concern basis

of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to

events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the group's and the parent company's ability to

continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw

attention in our report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are

inadequate, to modify the auditor’s opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up

to the date of our report. However, future events or conditions may cause the group or the parent company

to cease to continue as a going concern.

Our evaluation of the directors’ assessment of the group's and the parent company’s ability to continue to

adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:

© Reviewing management’s assessment of going concern assumptions and supporting information,
including a review of the budgets and cash flow forecasts to December 2025;

© Reviewing post year end trading to assess performance compared to forecasts;

e Reviewing ongoing large contracts with customers and the cash flows that are anticipated to arise from
these; :

© Monitoring significant post balance sheet events which may impact management’s assessment of their
going concern assumption,

e Reviewing the disclosures concerning the basis of preparation of the financial statements; and

e Assessing the appropriateness of the policy under relevant accounting framework and rationale for the
Directors’ assessment that the group is a going concern.

In our evaluation of the directors’ conclusions, we considered the inherent risks associated with the group's
and the parent company's business model including effects arising from macro-economic uncertainties such
as rising interest rates and inflationary pressures, we assessed and challenged the reasonableness of
estimates made by the directors and the related disclosures and analysed how those risks might affect the
group's and the parent company's financial resources or ability to continue operations over the going
concern period.
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of
accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. :
Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events
or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group's and the parent
company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the
financial statements are authorised for issue.
Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in
the relevant sections of this report.
Other information

’ The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial
statements and our auditor’s report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information
contained within the annual report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other
information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form
of assurance conclusion thereon.
Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information
is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise
appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material
misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial
statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material
misstatement of this other information, we ate required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
¢ the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which the

financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and

the strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal
requirements.

Matter on which we are required to report under the Companies Act 2006

In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the parent company and their
environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the
strategic report or the directors’ report.

re) Grant Thornton

Independent auditor's report to the members of
EA Technology Limited

Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006
requites us to report to you if, in our opinion:

¢ adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our
audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or

© the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns;
or

© certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
© we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

Responsibilities of directors

As explained mote fully in the directors' responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the

preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for

such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial

statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors ate responsible for assessing the group's and the parent

company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern

and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or

the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are

free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that

includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit

conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.

Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate,

they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these

financial statements.

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. The extent to

which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below:

© We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks applicable to the Group and the
industry in which it operates. We determined that the most significant laws and regulations are the
Companies Act 2006 and FRS 102 “The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and
Republic of Ireland”;

© We obtained an understanding of how the Group is complying with those legal and regulatory
frameworks by making enquiries of management and those responsible for legal and compliance
procedures. We corroborated our enquiries through review of board minutes;

© We assessed the susceptibility of the Group’s financial statements to material misstatement, including
how fraud might occur. Audit procedures performed by the group engagement team included:

— Evaluation of the processes and controls established to address the risks related to irregularities and
fraud;

— Making enquiries, in respect of fraud, of those outside the finance team, including key management
and the board;

Independent auditor's report to the members of
EA Technology Limited

- Challenging assumptions and judgements made by management in the Group’s significant
accounting estimates;

— Identifying and testing unusual journal entries; and
— Identifying and testing related party transactions.

© These audit procedures were designed to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements
were free from fraud or error. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher
than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error and detecting irregularities that result from fraud
is inherently more difficult than detecting those that result from error, as fraud may involve collusion,
deliberate concealment, forgery or intentional misrepresentations. Also, the further removed non-
compliance with laws and regulations is from events and transactions reflected in the financial
statements, the less likely we would become aware of it;

© The assessment of the appropriateness of the collective competence and capabilities of the engagement
team included the consideration of the engagement team’s knowledge of the industry in which the
Group operates, and the understanding of, and practical experience with, audit engagements of a similar
nature and complexity through appropriate training and participation;

© The engagement team’s discussions in respect of potential non-compliance with laws and regulations
included the risk of fraud in revenue recognition;

¢ In assessing the potential risks of material misstatement, we obtained an understanding of:

— The Group’s operations, including the nature of its revenue source, expected financial statements
disclosures and business risks that may result in a risk of material misstatement; and

— The Group’s control environment including the adequacy of procedures for authorisation of
transactions;

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the
Financial Reporting Council’s website at: www. frc.org.uk/auditorstesponsibilities. This description forms
part of our auditor’s report.

Principal accounting policies

General Information

EA Technology Limited is a private company limited by share capital incorporated in the UK with its
registered office at Capenhurst Technology Park, Capenhurst, Chester CH1 6ES. The Group and parent
Company are principally engaged in supplying electricity network support technologies throughout the UK
and internationally. Its core business is the provision of technical and business consultancy, technical
services products and training to the owners and operators of electricity networks, large energy users and
related organisations.

Basis of preparation

The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention
and in accordance with FRS 102 “The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of
Ireland” and the Companies Act 2006 and applicable UK accounting standards (United Kingdom Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice). The financial statements are presented in Sterling (£).

Basis of consolidation

The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings (see
note 9) drawn up to 31 March 2024, except as disclosed in note 8. Profits or losses on intra~Group
transactions are eliminated in full.

The results and financial position of foreign subsidiaries are translated into sterling as follows:

a) Assets and liabilities are translated at the closing exchange rate at the balance sheet date.
b) Income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the year.

c) All resulting exchange rate differences are dealt with in the consolidated statement of comprehensive
income.

Going Concern

The Directors have prepared the financial statements on the going concern basis. The Directors have
considered the financial forecasts to December 2025 taking into consideration the environments of the
domestic and worldwide economy.

In the period between the year then ended and the date of this report, the Group was acquired by Summa
Equity AB. As a result, the entity received a further £7.5m capital investment, of which included £4.7m of
additional cash for use in the development of existing and future trade.

The Directors have considered various downside sensitivities over the review period. Although there are
challenges and uncertainties around trading, the Group has reasonable cash reserves which can be utilised
for its ongoing operations.

Significant judgements and estimates

Preparation of the financial statements requires management to make significant judgements and estimates.
The items in the financial statements where these significant judgements and estimates have been made include:

Accrued/Deferred Income calculation
Income recognition is based on project manager’s assessment of the completeness of the project.
Comparison of costs to budget and stage invoicing support the value recognised.

Principal accounting policies

The useful expected lives of intangible and tangible assets
Useful economic lives are determined by management based on historical experience.

The capitalisation of Intangible fixed assets

Future economic benefits are determined by management based on forecast expectations.

The cost will be based on time and material costs directly attributable to the asset.

Stock provisions

The stock provision is determined by ageing the stock in conjunction with managements knowledge. The
provision applied reduces the carrying value to its selling price less costs to sell.

Turnover

Turnover is the total amount receivable by the Group for goods supplied and services provided, excluding
VAT and trade discounts. In respect of sales of products, turnover is recognised upon delivery of the
goods, and in respect of services, upon completion of those services.

Long-term contracts

In respect of long-term contracts and contracts for on-going services, turnover represents the value of work
done in the year, including estimates of amounts not invoiced by reference to the stage of completion.

Tangible fixed assets and depreciation

Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is calculated to write down the cost less estimated residual value of all tangible fixed assets by
equal annual instalments over their expected useful lives, starting in the year after acquisition. The period
applicable for vehicles, fixtures, fittings, tools and equipment is 3-5 years.

Intangible fixed asset and amortisation

Intangible fixed assets are stated at cost, net of amortisation and any provision for impairment.
Amortisation is calculated to write down the cost less estimated residual value of all intangible fixed assets
by equal annual instalments over their expected useful lives, starting in the year of acquisition. The period
applicable for intellectual property is 5-10 years.

Investments

Investments are included at cost less amounts written off. Profits or losses arising from disposals of fixed
asset investments are treated as part of the result from ordinary activities.

In respect of the Group's own shates which are held by the EA Technology Limited Employee Share
Ownership Trust (ESOT), the consideration paid for the shares is deducted in arriving at shareholders’
funds.

Principal accounting policies

Impairment of assets

At each reporting date, fixed assets are reviewed to determine whether there is any indication that those
assets have suffered an impairment loss. If there is an indication of possible impairment, the recoverable
amount of any affected asset is estimated and compared with its carrying amount. If estimated recoverable
amount is lower, the carrying amount is reduced to its estimated recoverable amount, and an impairment _
loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.

If an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised
estimate of its recoverable amount, but not in excess of the amount that would have been determined had
no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is
recognised immediately in profit or loss.

Income in advance

Income in advance included in creditors relates to amounts invoiced which relate to future periods. It is
credited to the Income statement over the life of the project to which it relates.

Stocks and work in progress

Stocks and short-term work in progress are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of
stock represents the purchase value of the goods and costs to bring it to its current location. Net realisable
value is based on estimated selling price, less further costs expected to be incurred to completion and
disposal. Provision is made for obsolete, slow moving or defective items where appropriate.

Debtors
Short terms debtors are measured at transaction price, less any impairment.

Creditors

Short term trade cteditors are measured at transaction price. Other financial liabilities, including loans, are
measured initially at fair value, net of transaction costs and are measured subsequently at amortised cost
using the effective interest method.

Current tax

The current tax charge is based on the profit or loss for the year and is measured at the amounts expected
to be paid based on the tax rates and laws substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Current and
deferred tax is recognised in the income statement for the period except to the extent that it is attributable
to income or expense that is or has been recognised directly in the statement of total comprehensive
income.

Deferred tax

Deferred tax is recognised on all timing differences where the transactions or events that give the Group an
obligation to pay mote tax in the future, or a right to pay less tax in the future, have occurred by the balance
sheet date. Deferred tax assets are recognised when it is more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax is measured using tates of tax that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance
sheet date. Deferred tax is not subject to discounting.

EA Technology Limited
Financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2024 16

Principal accounting policies

Contributions to pension schemes

Defined Contribution Scheme
The pension costs charged against profits are the contributions payable to the scheme in respect of the

accounting period.
Research and development

Development expenditure incurred on clearly defined projects whose outcome can be assessed with
reasonable certainty is carried forward and amortisation is charged in line with the expected income arising
from the projects.

Other development expenditure and research expenditure is written off in the year in which it is incurred.

Foreign currencies

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the
balance sheet date. All exchange differences are dealt with through the Income statement.

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash is represented by cash in hand repayable without penalty on notice of not more than 24 hours. Cash
equivalents are highly liquid investments that mature is no more than three months from the date of
acquisition and that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash with insignificant change in value.

Share based payments

Where share options are awarded to employees, the fair value of the options at the date of grant is charged
to the Statement of income and retained earnings over the vesting period. Non-market vesting conditions
are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments expected to vest at each Statement of
financial position date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is
based on the number of options that eventually vest. Market vesting conditions are factored into the fair
value of the options granted. The cumulative expense is not adjusted for failure of achieve a market vesting
condition.

The fair value of the award also takes into account non-vesting conditions. These are factors beyond the
control of either party.

Where the terms and conditions of options are modified before they vest, the increase in the fair value of
the options, measured immediately before and after the modification, is also charges to the Statement of
income and retained earnings over the remaining vesting period.

Government grants
Grants of a revenue nature are recognised in the Income Statement in the same period as the related

expenditure. Furlough income, which is a grant awarded by the government, is recognised in income in the
periods in which the company recognises the related costs for which the grant is intended to compensate.

Financial risk management

The Group has exposures to three main areas of risk — foreign exchange currency exposure, liquidity risk
and customer credit exposute.

Foreign exchange transactional currency exposure

The Group is exposed to currency rate risk in the group’s subsidiaries in Australia, China, Singapore and
USA. The UK, where possible, trades in sterling to minimise the exposure to foreign exchange rate
fluctuations.

Liquidity risk

The objective of the group in managing liquidity risk is to ensure that it can meet its financial obligations as
and when they fall due. The group expects to meet its financial obligations through operating cash flows.
Cash flow projections are prepared monthly reflecting the following 12 months so that mitigating actions
can be taken if a shortfall is foreseen.

Customer credit exposure

The Group may offer credit terms to its customers which allow payment of the debt after delivery of the
goods or services. The group is at risk to the extent that a customer may be unable to pay the debt on the
specified due date. This risk is mitigated by maintaining strong on-going customer relationships.

Leasing commitments

The Group’s future minimum operating lease payments are as follows:

2024 2023

£'000 £000

Within one year 557 583
Between one and five years 299 803
