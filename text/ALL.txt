Notes to the financial statements
Year ended 31 July 2024
1.
General information
The company is a private company limited by shares, registered in England and Wales. The address of
the registered office is 127 Faringdon Avenue, Bromley, England, BR2 8BT.
2.
Statement of compliance
These financial statements have been prepared in compliance with the provisions of FRS 102, Section 1A, 'The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland'.
3.
Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis.
The financial statements are prepared in sterling, which is the functional currency of the entity.
Turnover
Turnover is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for services rendered,
net of discounts and Value Added Tax.
Revenue from the rendering of services is measured by reference to the stage of completion of the
service transaction at the end of the reporting period provided that the outcome can be reliably
estimated. When the outcome cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is recognised only to the extent
that expenses recognised are recoverable.
Taxation
The taxation expense represents the aggregate amount of current and deferred tax recognised in the reporting period. Tax is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in capital and reserves. In this case, tax is recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in capital and reserves, respectively. Current tax is recognised on taxable profit for the current and past periods. Current tax is measured at the amounts of tax expected to pay or recover using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
No provision for deferred taxation has been provided for in the financial statements, due to the amount
not being material.
Operating leases
Lease payments are recognised as an expense over the lease term on a straight-line basis. The aggregate benefit of lease incentives is recognised as a reduction to expense over the lease term, on a straight-line basis.
Tangible assets
tangible assets are initially recorded at cost, and are subsequently stated at cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Depreciation
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost or valuation of an asset, less its residual value,
over the useful economic life of that asset as follows:
Fittings fixtures and equipment
-
25
%
straight line
If there is an indication that there has been a significant change in depreciation rate, useful life or residual value of tangible assets, the depreciation is revised prospectively to reflect the new estimates.
Impairment
A review for indicators of impairment is carried out at each reporting date, with the recoverable amount being estimated where such indicators exist. Where the carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount, the asset is impaired accordingly. Prior impairments are also reviewed for possible reversal at each reporting date.
Financial instruments
A financial asset or a financial liability is recognised only when the company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Basic financial instruments are initially recognised at the transaction price, unless the arrangement
constitutes a financing transaction, where it is recognised at the present value of the future payments
discounted at a market rate of interest for a similar debt instrument.
Debt instruments are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Financial assets that are measured at cost or amortised cost are reviewed for objective evidence of impairment at the end of each reporting date. If there is objective evidence of impairment, an impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss immediately. For all equity instruments regardless of significance, and other financial assets that are individually significant, these are assessed individually for impairment. Other financial assets are either assessed individually or grouped on the basis of similar credit risk characteristics. Any reversals of impairment are recognised in profit or loss immediately, to the extent that the reversal does not result in a carrying amount of the financial asset that exceeds what the carrying amount would have been had the impairment not previously been recognised.
Defined contribution plans
Contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as an expense in the period in which the related service is provided. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that the prepayment will lead to a reduction in future payments or a cash refund.
