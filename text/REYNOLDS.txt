STATUTORY INFORMATION

Reynolds Training Services Limited is a private company, limited by shares , registered in England and Wales.
The company's registered number and registered office address can be found on the Company Information page.

The significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all years presented unless otherwise stated.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of preparing the financial statements

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102 "The
Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland” including the provisions of Section 1A
"Small Entities" and the Companies Act 2006. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical
cost convention.

Turnover
Turnover is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable net of VAT and trade discounts.

Intangible assets
Intangible assets are initially measured at cost. After initial recognition, intangible assets are measured at cost
less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.

Computer software is being amortised evenly over its estimated useful life of three years.

Tangible fixed assets

Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost or valuation less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment
losses. Cost includes costs directly attributable to making the asset capable of operating as intended.

Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets, at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated
residual value, of each asset on a systematic basis over its expected useful life as follows:

Fixtures and fittings - 33% on cost
Computer equipment - 33% on cost
Plant and machinery - 5% on cost
Improvement to property - 20% on cost
Taxation

Current tax represents the amount of tax payable or receivable in respect of the taxable profit (or loss) for the
current or past reporting periods. It is measured at the amount expected to be paid or recovered using the tax
rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.

Deferred tax represents the future tax consequences of transactions and events recognised in the financial
statements of current and previous periods. It is recognised in respect of all timing differences, with certain
exceptions. Timing differences are differences between taxable profits and total comprehensive income as stated
in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of income and expense in tax assessments in periods
different from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements. Unrelieved tax losses and other
deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered against the
reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.

Deferred tax is measured using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the
balance sheet date that are expected to apply to the reversal of timing differences. Deferred tax on revalued
non-depreciable tangible fixed assets and investment properties is measured using the rates and allowances that
apply to the sale of the asset.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued

Employee benefits
When employees have rendered service to the company, short-term employee benefits to which the employees
are entitled are recognised at the undiscounted amount expected to be paid in exchange for that service.

Debtors & creditors

Debtors and creditors with no stated interest rate and receivable or payable within one year are recorded at
transaction price. Any losses arising from impairment are recognised in the profit and loss account in other
administrative expenses.

Hire purchase and leasing commitments

Assets acquired under finance leases are capitalised and depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and the
expected useful life of the asset. Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the
reduction of the outstanding lease liability using the effective interest method. The related obligations, net of future
finance charges, are included in creditors.

Rentals payable and receivable under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight
line basis over the period of the lease.

EMPLOYEES AND DIRECTORS
The average number of employees during the year was 9 (2023-8).
