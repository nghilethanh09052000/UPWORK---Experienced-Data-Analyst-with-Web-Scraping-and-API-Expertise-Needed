Accounting policies

Company information
Apprentify Limited is a private company limited by shares incorporated in England and Wales. The registered office is
25 Water Lane, First Floor, Wilmslow, Cheshire, SK9 5AR.

Accounting convention

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 102 “The Financial Reporting Standard
applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland” (“FRS 102") and the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 as
applicable to companies subject to the small companies regime. The disclosure requirements of section 1A of FRS
102 have been applied other than where additional disclosure is required to show a true and fair view.

The financial statements are prepared in sterling, which is the functional currency of the company. Monetary amounts
in these financial statements are rounded to the nearest £.

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention. The principal accounting policies
adopted are set out below.

Turnover
Turnover is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for employment placement services
provided in the normal course of business, and is shown net of VAT.

Research and development expenditure
Research expenditure is written off against profits in the year in which it is incurred. Identifiable development
expenditure is capitalised to the extent that the technical, commercial and financial feasibility can be demonstrated.

Intangible fixed assets other than goodwill
Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are recognised at cost and are subsequently measured at cost
less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.

Intangible assets acquired on business combinations are recognised separately from goodwill at the acquisition date
where it is probable that the expected future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the entity
and the fair value of the asset can be measured reliably; the intangible asset arises from contractual or other legal
rights; and the intangible asset is separable from the entity.

Development costs 10 Years Straight Line
Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost net of depreciation and any

impairment losses.

Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost of asscts Icss their residual values over their useful lives an the
following bases:

Plant and machinery 5 Years Straight Line

The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the sale proceeds and the
carrying value of the asset, and is credited or charged to profit or loss.

Accounting policies (Continued)

Impairment of fixed assets

At each reporting period end date, the company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to
determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication
exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if
any). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the company estimates the
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.

Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the
estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future
cash flaws have not been adjusted.

If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the
carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is
recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the
impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents are basic financial assets and include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other
short-term liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are
shown within borrowings in current liabilities.

Financial instruments
The company has elected to apply the provisions of Section 11 ‘Basic Financial Instruments’ and Section 12 ‘Other
Financial Instruments Issues’ of FRS 102 to all of its financial instruments.

Financial instruments are recognised in the company's balance sheet when the company becomes party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument.

Financial assets and liabilities are offset, with the net amounts presented in the financial statements, when there is a
legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to realise
the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Basic financial assets

Basic financial assets, which include debtors and cash and bank balances, are initially measured at transaction price
including transaction costs and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method unless
the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where the transaction is measured at the present value of the
future receipts discounted at a market rate of interest. Financial assets classified as receivable within one year are not
amortised.

Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets, other than those held at fair value through profit and loss, are assessed for indicators of impairment
at each reporting end date.

Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred
after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows have been affected. If an asset is
impaired, the impairment loss is the difference between the carrying amount and the present value of the estimated
cash flows discounted at the asset's original effective interest rate. The impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss:

If there is a decrease in the impairment loss arising from an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the
impairment is reversed. The reversal is such that the current carrying amount does not exceed what the carrying
amount would have been, had the impairment not previously been recognised. The impairment reversal is recognised
in profit or loss.

Accounting policies (Continued)

Derecognition of financial assets

Financial assets are derecognised only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or are
settled, or when the company transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to
another entity, or if some significant risks and rewards of ownership are retained but control of the asset has
transferred to another party that is able to sell the asset in its entirety to an unrelated third party.

Classification of financial liabilities

Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements
entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the company after
deducting all of its liabilities.

Basic financial liabilities

Basic financial liabilities, including creditors, bank loans and loans from fellow group companies, are initially
recognised at transaction price unless the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where the debt instrument
is measured at the present value of the future payments discounted at a market rate of interest. Financial liabilities
classified as payable within one year are not amortised.

Debt instruments are subsequently carried at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.

Trade creditors are obligatians to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business
from suppliers. Amounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less. If not,
they are presented as non-current liabilities. Trade creditors are recognised initially at transaction price and
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

Derecognition of financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the company’s contractual obligations expire or are discharged or
cancelled.

Equity instruments
Eauity instruments issued by the company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of transaction costs. Dividends
payable on equity instruments are recognised as liabilities once they are no longer at the discretion of the company.

Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.

Current tax

The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the
profit and loss account because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years
and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The company's liability for current tax is calculated
using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting end date.

Accounting policies (Continued)

Deferred tax

Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all timing differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the
extent that it is probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable
profits. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the timing difference arises from goodwill or from the initial
recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting end date and reduced to the extent that it is
no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the
assetis realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the profit and loss account, except when it relates to items
charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are offset when the company has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and
the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority.

Employee benefits
The costs of short-term employee benefits are recognised as a liability and an expense, unless those costs are
required to be recognised as part of the cost of stock or fixed assets.

The cost of any unused holiday entitlement is recognised in the period in which the employee's services are received.

Termination benefits are recognised immediately as an expense when the company is demonstrably committed to
terminate the employment of an employee or to provide termination benefits.

Retirement benefits
Payments lo defined contribution retirement benefil schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.

Leases

Rentals payable under operating leases, including any lease incentives received, are charged to profit or loss on a
straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease except where another more systematic basis is more
representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed.

Employees

The average monthly number of persons (including directors) employed by the company during the year was:
