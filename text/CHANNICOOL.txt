Notes to the Financial Statements
For The Year Ended 30 September 2024

1. General Information

Channicool Training Services Limited is a private company, limited by shares, incorporated in England & Wales,
registered number 07025855 . The registered office is 2 Broadley Court, Parkwood Close, Roborough, Plymouth, PL6
78Q.

2. Accounting Policies
2.1. Basis of Preparation of Financial Statements

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with
Financial Reporting Standard 102 section 1A Small Entities "The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the
UK and Republic of Ireland” and the Companies Act 2006.

2.2. Turnover

Turnover is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of discounts and value
added taxes. Turnover includes revenue earned from the sale of goods and from the rendering of services.
Turnover is reduced for estimated customer returns, rebates and other similar allowances.

Sale of goods

Turnover from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods
has transferred to the buyer. This is usually at the point that the customer has signed for the delivery of the
goods.

Rendering of services

Turnover from the rendering of services is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract.
The stage of completion of a contract is measured by comparing the costs incurred for work performed to date
to the total estimated contract costs. Turnover is only recognised to the extent of recoverable expenses when
the outcome of a contract cannot be estimated reliably.

2.3. Tangible Fixed Assets and Depreciation

Tangible fixed assets are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment
losses. Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost of the fixed assets, less their estimated
residual value, over their expected useful lives on the following bases:

Plant & Machinery 20% straight line
Fixtures & Fittings 25% reducing balance

2.4. Taxation
Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.

The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in
the statement of comprehensive income because of items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible
in other years and items that are never taxable or deductible. The company's liability for current tax is calculated
using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.

Current for the year is recognised in profit or loss, except when they related to items that are recognised in
other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax is also recognised
in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.

3. Average Number of Employees

Average number of employees, including directors, during the year was: 3 (2023: 2)
