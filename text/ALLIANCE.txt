TRUSTEES' REPORT

The trustees present their report and accounts for the year ended 31 July 2024.

The trustees confirm that the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Statement of Recommended
Practice: Accounting and Reporting by Charities preparing their accounts in accordance with the Financial Reporting Standard
applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland (FRS 102) issued in October 2019 and the Charities Act 2011 and UK Generally
Accepted Practice as it applies from 1 January 2019.

Objectives and activities

The principal activity of the charity continues to be to promote and advance education and training of persons engaged or
intending to be engaged in industry and commerce. The charity's mission statement is "Success through Learning".

The trustees confirm that they have referred to the Charity Commission's guidance on public benefit when reviewing the
charity's aims and objectives and in planning future activities. On 31 March 2020, Alliance Learning became part of the
University of Bolton Group. Following this, Alliance Learning became an Exempt Charity on 10 June 2020.

The charity furthers its purpose for the public benefit through the provision and operation of training centres, workshops and
other facilities for training and education, the provision of training courses, instruction and demonstrations. Alliance Learning is
committed to providing and improving outcomes for all learners and customers in line with Ofsted's "Education Inspection
Framework”.

Achievements and performance

The charity continues to deliver apprenticeships and vocational learning under a contract with the Education & Skills Funding
Agency (ESFA), with new programmes offered for the 2024-2025 contract year.

The charity was graded ‘good’ by Ofsted in July 2024, following an ‘inadequate’ inspection in February 2023 which resulted in
a recruitment pause sanction imposed by the ESFA, this had a negative impact on income during 2023-24. The charity is
now focused on achieving recruitment targets whilst ensuring a high quality learner experience.

The overall Apprentice achievement rate for 2023-2024 was 63% (2022-2023 was 58%).
The Charity continues to review and develop all areas of business, including Alliance Learning Training.

After becoming part of The University of Bolton Group on the 31 March 2020, Alliance Learning benefits from collaboration with
other members of the University of Bolton Group, particularly the University itself and Bolton College on Apprenticeships, in
areas such as the sharing of best practice, development of new provision, staff CPD and business development.

Alliance has many ‘success stories' which were showcased during the Awards Evening held in June and attended by
apprentices and their families, employers and a local dignitary.

External accrediations

Successful re-accreditation of the Matrix standard was achieved in June 2024 which received favourable feedback.

TRUSTEES’ REPORT

Risk management policy

The trustees have assessed the major risks to which the charity is exposed, in particular those related to the
operations and finances of the charity and are satisfied that adequate systems are in place to mitigate our exposure
to the major risks.

The year ahead

Alliance welcomed David Haslam as Chief Executive Officer in August 2024, following the resignation of Dr Gill
Waugh on 31 July 2024. David Haslam was formerly Group Director of Apprenticeships at the University of Bolton
and has held posts at Bolton College.

A new strategic plan will be developed and presented to the trustees’ to ensure that the charity is sustainable and
best able to deliver its charitable objectives for public benefit, taking into account market conditions and the policy
environment, alongside efficient and high quality delivery models. Going forward, Alliance Learning is developing a
range of commercial activity and expanding Apprenticeship training to meet demand.

Financial performance will continue to be monitored on a monthly basis, through the provision of monthiy
management accounts and during Board meetings.

Financial review
The charity was re-inspected by Ofsted and graded as ‘good’ in July 2024.

However, the outcome of the Ofsted inspection in February 2023 resulting in an ‘inadequate’ grade, and the
subsequent ESFA sanction to pause apprentice recruitment, weakened the charity's financial position in the year to
July 2023, and this has continued into the financial year to July 2024.

Although the ESFA sanction was lifted in August 2023, this was too late in the recruitment cycle for usual levels of
recruitment in 2023-24. This has had a significant adverse impact on the financial results for the year to July 2024,
and will continue into the next year to July 2025 until the apprentice numbers recover to sustainable levels.

The trustees have adopted a reserves policy which seeks to maintain the financial stability of the charity.

Current levels of reserves are shown in Note 18 to the financial statements.

The trustees have set a budget for the year to July 2025 which seeks to recover the financial position to produce a
surplus of income over expenditure and so strengthen the reserves position.

The current level of free reserves, being those unrestricted funds, which are not represented by fixed assets used by
the company are:

£
Total unrestricted funds 65,431
Less unrestricted tangible fixed assets Note 18 (1,246,064)
Less investments Note 18 (1,000)
Total free reserves (1,181,633)
Defined benefit pension liability repayable in over 1 year 987,523
Adjusted free reserves (194,110)

The free reserves are calculated after deducting the pension fund deficit, which has increased during the year to
£1,104,250. This deficit will be cleared over many years. The element repayable in the year ended 31 July 2025 will
be £116,727. When assessing how the group is performing against its target level of reserves, the trustees consider
it to be appropriate to add back the non-current portion of the deficit, i.e. £987,523. The gives an adjusted free
reseres figure of approximately (£194,110).

Restricted reserves at 31 July 2024 were £233,621, represented by fixed assets.

University of Bolton Group governance arrangements

Alliance Learning is included in the University of Bolton's Group Protocol for Reporting of Assurance Concerns as part of its
Group Governance arrangements. It is not the intention that the University should replicate the scrutiny of the Board of the
subsidiary organisation (and any of its Committees) or to subsume any of their responsibilities, but, in its Group role, it seeks
assurance that the reporting and governance processes are operating effectively in that organisation and that any issues are
appropriately escalated to Group level in a timely manner.

STATEMENT OF TRUSTEES' RESPONSIBILITIES

The trustees, who are also the directors of Alliance Learning for the purpose of company law, are responsible for preparing
the Trustees’ Report and the accounts in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

Company Law requires the trustees to prepare accounts for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of
affairs of the charity and of the incoming resources and application of resources, including the income and expenditure, of the
charitable company for that year.

In preparing these accounts, the trustees are required to:

- select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
- observe the methods and principles in the Charities SORP;
- make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;

- state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and
explained in the accounts; and

- prepare the accounts on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the charity will continue in
operation.

The trustees are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the
financial position of the charity and enable them to ensure that the accounts comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are
also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the charity and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and
detection of fraud and other irregularities.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF

ALLIANCE LEARNING

Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of Alliance Learning (the ‘parent company’) for the year ended 31 July 2024 which
comprise the consolidated statement of financial activities, the group and charity balance sheets, the group statement of
cash flows and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. The financial
reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards,
including Financial Reporting Standard 102, the Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

In our opinion the financial statements:

* give a true and fair view of the state of the group and charitable company's affairs as at 31 July 2024 and of its incoming
resources and application of resources for the year then ended;

+ have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and

* have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Companies Act 2006.

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing {UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial
statements section of our report. We are independent of the charitable company in accordance with the ethical requirements
that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled
our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Conclusions relating to going concern

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the trustees’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the
preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that,
individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of
at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

Our responsibilities and responsibilities of the trustees with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of
this report.

Other information

The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and our
auditor's report thereon. The trustees are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report. Our opinion
on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our
report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing. so, consider whether the other information is materially
inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be
materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to
determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we
have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that
fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF

ALLIANCE LEARNING

Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

+ the information given in the trustees’ report, which includes the directors’ report prepared for the purposes of company law,
for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and

+ the directors' report included within the trustees' report has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

Matters on which we are required to report by exception

In light of the knowledge and understanding of the charitable company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit,
we have not identified material misstatements in the directors’ report included within the trustees’ report.

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to
report to you if, in our opinion:

+ adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches
not visited by us; or

+ the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or

+ certain disclosures of trustees' remuneration specified by law are not made; or

+ we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit

Responsibilities of trustees

As explained more fully in the statement of trustees‘ responsibilities, the trustees (who are also directors of Alliance Learning
for the purposes of company law) are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that
they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the trustees determine is necessary to enable the preparation of
financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the trustees are responsible for assessing the charitable company's ability to continue
as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of
accounting unless the trustees either intend to liquidate the charitable company or to cease operations, or have no realistic
alternative but to do so.

Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance
is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of
these financial statements. .

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF

ALLIANCE LEARNING

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in fine with
our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities including fraud. Our approach
to identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including fraud and non-compliance
with laws and regulations, was as follows:

+ the engagement partner ensured that the engagement team collectively had the appropriate competence, capabilities and
skills to identify or recognise non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations;

+ we identified the laws and regulations applicable to the charitable company through discussions with trustees and other
management, and from our commercial knowledge and experience of the charity sector;

* we focused on specific laws and regulations which we considered may have a direct material effect on the financial
statements or the operations of the charity, including the Companies Act 2006, employment and health and safety
legislation;

* we assessed the extent of compliance with the laws and regulations identified above through making enquiries of
management and inspecting legal correspondence; and

» identified laws and regulations were communicated within the audit team regularly and the team remained alert to instances
of non-compliance throughout the audit.

We assessed the susceptibility of the company's financial statements to material misstatement, including obtaining an
understanding of how fraud might occur, by:

* making enquiries of management as to where they considered there was susceptibility to fraud, their knowledge of actual,
suspected and alleged fraud; and

* considering the internal controls in place to mitigate risks of fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations.
To address the risk of fraud through management bias and override of controls, we:

+ performed analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships;
+ tested journal entries to identify unusual transactions; and

* assessed whether judgements and assumptions made in determining the accounting estimates were indicative of potential
bias.

In response to the risk of irregularities and non-compliance with laws and regulations, we designed procedures which
included, but were not limited to:

* agreeing financial statement disclosures to underlying supporting documentation;
* reading the minutes of meetings of those charged with governance; and
* enquiring of management as to actual and potential litigation and claims.

There are inherent limitations in our audit procedures described above. The more removed that laws and regulations are from
financial transactions, the less likely it is that we would become aware of non-compliance. Auditing standards also limit the
audit procedures required to identify non-compliance with laws and regulations to enquiry of the directors and other
management and the inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence, if any.

Material misstatements that arise due to fraud can be harder to detect than those that arise from error as they may involve
deliberate concealment or collusion.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting
Council's website at: www. frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilites. This description forms part of our auditor's report.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF

matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by

Accounting policies

Company information

Alliance Learning ("the company”) is a charitable company limited by guarantee, incorporated in England and
Wales. The registered office is The Hurst Building, Horwich Business Park, Chorley New Road, Bolton.

Alliance Learning meets the definition of a public benefit entity under FRS102.

The group consists of Alliance Learning and its subsidiaries, Alliance Learning Training Limited and Rivington
College Limited.

Accounting convention

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Charities Act 2011 and "Accounting and
Reporting by Charities: Statement of Recommended Practice applicable to charities preparing their accounts in
accordance with the Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland (FRS 102)
(effective 1 January 2019)".

The financial statements are prepared in sterling, which is the functional currency of the charitable company.
Monetary amounts in these financial statements are rounded to the nearest £.

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention. The principal accounting
policies adopted are set out below.

Basis of consolidation

The consolidated financial statements incorporate those of Alliance Learning and Alliance Learning Training
Limited. The other subsidiary is excluded from the consolidation as it is currently registered as dormant, and
its share capital and reserves as a whole are insignificant to the group.

All intra-group transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies are
eliminated on consolidation.

Going concern
At the time of approving the financial statements, the trustees have given consideration to recent and expected
future trading results and have a reasonable expectation that the group and the parent company has adequate

resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus, the trustees continue to adopt the
going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.

The group and the charity is reliant on the financial support given by its ultimate parent undertaking, the
University of Bolton. The support is in place for 12 months from signing, and it is anticipated that this support will
continue for the foreseeable future.

Charitable funds

General funds are unrestricted funds which are available for use at the discretion of the trustees in furtherance of
the objects of the charity without further purpose and which have not been designated for other purposes.

Restricted funds are subject to specific conditions by donors as to how they may be used. Expenditure which
meets these criteria is charged to the fund.

1.7

Accounting policies (continued)

Incoming resources

Income is generally recognised on a receivable basis and is reported gross of related expenditure where the
amount is reasonably certain and when there is adequate certainty of receipt.

The specific bases used are as follows:

- Income from charitable activities and commercial courses is accounted for when earned and courses
have been delivered. Income received in advance is deferred until entittement to the income has
arisen, at which time, it is credited to the statement of financial activities (SOFA)

Government grants are recognised at the fair value of the asset received or receivable when there is

- reasonable assurance that the grant conditions will be met and the grants will be received. Where a
grant does not specify performance conditions it is recognised in income when the proceeds are
received or receivable.

- Investment income is accounted for on a receivable basis

Resources expended

Expenditure is recognised on an accruals basis as a liability is incurred. Expenditure includes any VAT which
cannot be fully recovered. Charitable expenditure comprises those costs incurred by the charity in the delivery
of its activities and senices for its beneficiaries. It includes both costs that can be allocated directly to such
activities and those costs of an indirect nature necessary to support them.

Governance costs include those costs associated with meeting the constitutional and statutory requirements
of the charity and include the audit fees and costs linked to the strategic management of the charity.

All costs are allocated between the expenditure categories of the SOFA on a basis designed to reflect the use
of the resource. Costs relating to a particular activity are allocated directly, others are apportioned on an
appropriate basis e.g. floor areas, per capita or estimated usage.

Tangible fixed assets and depreciation
Tangible fixed assets are initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost or valuation, net of

depreciation and any impairment losses.

Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over their
useful lives on the following bases:

Freehold land : Not depreciated

Freehold Buildings 2% per annum on cost

Fixtures, fittings & equipment 15-25% per annum on cost

Plant and machinery 15% per annum on the reducing balance

The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the sale
proceeds and the carrying value of the asset, and is recognised in the profit and loss account.

Any items capitalised are done so at cost and the charity Wews any expenditure of less than £500 to be non-
capital.

Accounting policies (continued)

Fixed asset investments

In the parent company financial statements, investments in subsidiaries are initially measured at cost and
subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Any impairment losses are
recognised in expenditure for the year.

A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the group. Control is the power to govern the financial and operating
policies of the entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.

Impairment of fixed assets

At each reporting period end date, the group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible assets to determine
whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists,
the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any).
Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents are basic financial assets and include cash in hand and deposits held at call with
banks.

Financial instruments

The group has elected to apply the provisions of Section 11 ‘Basic Financial instruments’ and Section 12
‘Other Financial Instruments Issues’ of FRS 102 to all of its financial instruments.

Financial instruments are recognised in the group's balance sheet when the group becomes party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument.

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amounts presented in the financial statements when
there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle ona
net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Basic financial assets

Basic financial assets, which include debtors and cash and bank balances, are initially measured at transaction
price.

Derecognition of financial assets

Financial assets are derecognised only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or are
settled, or when the charity transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership
to another entity, or if some significant risks and rewards of ownership are retained but control of the asset has
transferred to another party that is able to sell the asset in its entirety to an unrelated third party.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2024

Accounting policies (continued)

Basic financial liabilities

Basic financial liabilities, including creditors, bank loans and loans from fellow group companies, are recognised
at transaction price. Financial liabilities classified as payable within one year are not amortised.

Trade creditors are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of
business from suppliers. Amounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or
less. Ifnot, they are presented as non-current liabilities. Trade creditors are recognised at transaction price.

Derecognition of financial liabilities

Financial liabilities are derecognised when the charity's contractual obligations expire or are discharged or
cancelled.

Taxation

The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.

Current tax

The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as
reported in the Statement of Financial Activities because it excludes items of income or expense that are
taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The
group's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted
by the reporting end date.

Deferred tax

Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all timing differences and deferred tax assets are
recognised to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax
liabilities or other future taxable profits. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the timing difference
arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects
neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.

Employee benefits

The costs of short-term employee benefits are recognised as a liability and an expense.

The cost of any unused holiday entitlement is recognised in the period in which the employee's services are
received.

Termination benefits are recognised immediately as an expense when the group is demonstrably committed
to terminate the employment of an employee or to provide termination benefits.

Accounting policies (continued)

Retirement benefits

a

The regular cost of providing retirement pensions and related benefits under the charity's defined benefit
scheme is charged to the statement of financial activities over the employees’ sence lives on the basis of a
constant percentage of earnings. Any difference between the charge to the statement of financial activities and
the contributions paid to the scheme is shown as an asset or liability in the balance sheet.

Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.

Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty

In the application of the group's accounting policies, the trustees are required to make judgements, estimates
and assumptions about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that
are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting
estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised where the revision affects only that
period, or in the period of the revision and future periods, where the revision affects both current and future
periods.

Income from subsidiary's activities
The charity owns the whole of the ordinary share capital, consisting of 100 ordinary shares of £1 each, of

The group operates a defined contribution pension scheme for all qualfying employees. The assets of the scheme are

held separately from those of the group in an independently administered fund.

Defined benefit scheme

The group provides pensions for some employees through participation in a funded defined benefit scheme which is
administered by Trustees and maintained independently of the company's finances. The scheme used is the Alliance
Leaming Section of the Deloitte Master Plan (“the section"). The Section is closed to the further accrual of benefits. The
amounts included in the balance sheet arising from the group's obligations in respect of defined benefit plans are as

follows:

Present value of defined benefit obligations
Deficit in scheme

Movements in the present value of defined benefit obligations:
Liabilities at 1 August 2023
Additional payments in the year

Actuarial loss arising from the latest valuation

Liabilities at 31 July 2024

The defined benefit obligations arise from plans which are wholly or partly funded.

Retirement benefit schemes (continued)

A triennial vatuation of the section was undertaken at 31 March 2023. The market value of the fund assets amounted to £2,564,000 and the
section's technical provisions were calculated at £3,936,000 at this date. The technical provisions were valued by an independent qualified
actuary on the projected unit method of valuation using the following main assumptions, An updated valuation was performed at 31 March
2024 by the actuary. At this date the market value of the fund assets amounted to £2,424,000 and the section's technical provisions were
calculated at £3,565,000. The method of valuation of the retirement benefit scheme in the financial statements is based on the valuation at

31 March 2024 and not the triennial valuation.

Whilst participating in the Deloitte Pensions Master Plan, the assumed investment strategy was to hold 35% of the Fund's assets ina
Portfolio of gilts and corporate bonds and to hold 65% in a portfolio of equities and other return-seeking investments until 31 December 2019,
followed by a gradual switch to 100% of gilts and corporate bonds by 31 March 2039.

Discount rates:

Annualised Bank of England gilt spot yield at a suitable duration (10 years) plus a margin of 1.3%/0.5%

p.a. pre/post retirement, rounded to nearest 0.05% p.a.

On transferring the assets and liabilities to the section, the agreed strategic asset allocations were as follows:

Fund Allocation

All World Equity Index Fund 30%

Managed Property Fund 20%

Investment Grade Corporate Bond All Stocks Index 9
25%

Fund

Matching Core LDI Funds 25%

At the valuation date of 31 March 2024, the section's assets were not sufficient to meet its technical provisions, resulting in a deficit. The
deficit was estimated to be £1,141,000 at 31 March 2024. After payments were made in the year the deficit is £1,104,250 at the year end.

‘The actuarial valuation was carried out as at 31 March 2024.
