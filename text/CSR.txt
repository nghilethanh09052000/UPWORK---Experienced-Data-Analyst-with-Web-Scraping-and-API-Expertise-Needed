NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2024

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of preparing the financial statements

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102 "The Financial Reporting
Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland” including the provisions of Section 1A "Small Entities" and the Companies Act
2006. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.

Turnover
Turnover is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, excluding discounts, rebates, value added tax and
other sales taxes.

Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost, net of depreciation and any impairment losses.

Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost of assets less their residual values over their useful lives on the following bases:

Plant and machinery 25% on cost
Fixtures and fittings 25% on cost
Motor vehicles 25% on cost
Computer equipment 33% on cost

The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying
value-of the asset, and is credited or charged to profit or loss.

Taxation
Taxation for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Income Statement, except to the extent that it
relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.

Current or deferred taxation assets and liabilities are not discounted.

Current tax is recognised at the amount of tax payable using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted
by the statement of financial position date.

Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the statement of financial
position date.

Timing differences arise from the inclusion of income and expenses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they
are recognised in financial statements. Deferred tax is measured using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the year end and that are expected to apply to the reversal of the timing difference.

Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered
against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.

Hire purchase and leasing commitments

Assets obtained under hire purchase contracts or finance leases are capitalised in the balance sheet. Those held under hire purchase
contracts are depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Those held under finance leases are depreciated over their estimated
useful lives or the lease term, whichever is the shorter.

The interest element of these obligations is charged to profit or loss over the relevant period. The capital element of the future
payments is treated as a liability.

Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to profit or loss on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued

Pension costs and other post-retirement benefits
The company operates a defined contribution pension scheme. Contributions payable to the company's pension scheme are charged
to profit or loss in the period to which they relate.

Financial instruments
The company has elected to apply the provisions of Section 11 ‘Basic Financial Instruments’ and Section 12 ‘Other Financial
Instruments Issues’ of FRS 102 to all of its financial instruments.

Financial instruments are recognised when the company becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. -

Financial assets and liabilities are offset, with the net amounts presented in the financial statements, when there is a legally
enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle
the liability simultaneously.

Basic financial assets

Basic financial assets, which include trade and other debtors and cash and bank balances, are initially measured at transaction price
including transaction costs and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method unless the arrangement
constitutes a financing transaction, where the financial asset is measured at the present value of the future receipts discounted at a
market rate of interest.

Classification of financial liabilities

Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An
equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the company after deducting all of its liabilities.
Basic financial liabilities

Basic financial liabilities, including trade and other creditors, are initially recognised at transaction price unless the arrangement
constitutes a financing transaction, where the debt instrument is measured at the present value of the future payments discounted at
a market rate of interest.

EMPLOYEES AND DIRECTORS

The average number of employees during the year was 47 (2023 - 38).
