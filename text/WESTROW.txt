STATUTORY INFORMATION

Westrow Limited is a private company, limited by shares , registered in England and Wales. The company's registered
number and registered office address can be found on the Company Information page.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of preparing the financial statements

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102 "The Financial
Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland” including the provisions of Section 1A "Small Entities"
and the Companies Act 2006. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.

Turnover
Turnover represents franchise commissions reccivable, management charges, and rental income, net of value added tax.

Tangible fixed assets
Depreciation is provided at the following annual rates in order to write off each asset over its estimated useful life.

Short leasehold - Straight line over 6 years

Improvements to property - at varying rates on cost

Equipment - 25% on reducing balance

Fixtures and fittings - 25% on reducing balance and 20% on reducing balance
Computer equipment - 33.33% on cost

Investment property
Investment property is initially recognised at cost and now subsequently measured at fair value. Changes in fair value are
recognised in profit or loss.

Financial instruments
Basic financial instruments are recognised at amortised costs. Derivative financial instruments are initially recorded at cost
and thereafter at fair value with changes recognised in profit or loss.

Taxation
Taxation for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Income Statement, except to the extent that
it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.

Current or deferred taxation assets and liabilities are not discounted.

Current tax is recognised at the amount of tax payable using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the balance sheet date.

Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date.

Timing differences arise from the inclusion of income and expenses in tax assessments in periods different from those in
which they are recognised in financial statements. Deferred tax is measured using tax rates and laws that have been enacted

or substantively enacted by the year end and that are expected to apply to the reversal of the timing difference.

Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that they will be
recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.
