Basis of preparation of financial statements

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention unless otherwise
specified within these accounting policies and in accordance with FRS 102 'The Financial Reporting
Standard applicable in the UK and the Republic of Ireland’ and the requirements of the Companies
Act 2006. The disclosure requirements of Section 1A of FRS 102 have besn applied other than
where additional disclosure is required to show a true and fair view. -

The preparation of financial statements In compitance with FRS 102 requires the use of certain

critical accounting estimates. it also requires management to exercise judgement In applying the
Company's accounting policies (see note 3).

The following principal accounting policies have been applied:

Goljng concern

The directors have a reasonable expectation that the company has adequate resources to continue
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, the directors consider it

appropriate for the financial statements to be prepared on a going concem basis.

Revenue

Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the
Company and the revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is measured as the fair value of the
consideration received or receivable, excluding discounts, rebates, value added tax and other sales
taxes. The foflowing criteria must also be met before revenue Is recognised:

Rendering of services

Revenue from a contract to provide services is recognised in the period in which the services are

provided in accordance with the stage of completion of the contract when all of the following

conditions are satisfied:

° the amount of revenue can be measured reliably;

. it is probable that the Company will receive the consideration due under the contract;

. the stage of completion of the contract at the end of the reporting period can be measured
reliably; and

. the costs incurred and the costs to complete the contract can be measured reliably.

Operating leases: the Company as tessee

Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to profit or ioss on a straightline basis over the
lease term.

Government grants

Grants ere accounted under the accruals model as permitted by FRS 102. Grants relating to
expenditure on tangible fixed assets are credited to profit or loss at the same rate as the depreciation
on the assets to which the grant relates. The deferred element of grants is Included in creditors as

deferred Income.

Grants of a revenue nature are recognised In the Statement of Income and Retained Earnings in the
same period as the related expenditure.

Interest Income
Interest Income is recognised In profit or loss using the effective interest method.

Pensions

Defined contribution pension plan

The Company operates a defined contribution plan for its employees, A defined contribution plan Is a
pension plan under which the Company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. Once the
contributions have been paid the Company has no further payment obligations.

The contributions are recognised as an expense in profit or loss when they fall due. Amounts not paid
are shown In accruals as a liability in the Batance Sheet. The assets of the plan are held separately
from the Company in independently administered funds.

Taxation

Tax is recognised in profit or toss except that e charge attributable to an item of income and expense
recognised as other comprehensive income or to an item recognised directly in equity is also
tecognised In other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.

The current Income tax charge is calculated on the basis of tax rates and laws that have been
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date in the countries where the Company

operates and generates Income.

Deferred tax balances are recognised in respect of ail timing differences that have originated but not

reversed by the balance sheet date, except that:

The recognition of deferred tax assets Is limited to the extent that it is probable that they will be

recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits;

Any deferred tax balances are reversed if and when all conditions for retaining associated tax

allowances have been met; and

. Where they relate to timing differences in respect of interests in subsidiaries, associates,
branches and joint ventures and the Company can control the reversal of the timing
differences and such reversal is not considered probable in the foreseeable future.

Deferred tax balances are not recognised in respect of permanent differences except in respect of
business combinations, when deferred tax ls recognised on the differences between the fair values of
assets acquired and the future tax deductions available for them and the differences between the fair
values of liabilities acquired and the amount that will be assessed for tax. Deferred tax Is determined
using tax rates and jaws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.

2. Accounting pollcles (continued)

28 Intangible assets

Intangible assets are initially recognised at cost. After recognition, under the cost model, intangible
assets are measured at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment

All intangible assets are considered to have a finite useful life. If a reliable estimate of the useful life
cannot be made, the useful life shail not exceed ten years.

The estimated useful lives range as follows:
Computer Software - ; 10% - 33% straight line
2.10 Tangible fixed assets ,
Tangible fixed assets under the cost model are stated al historical cost less accumulated

depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Historical cost includes expenditure that Is
directly attributable to bringing the asset to the lacation and condition necessary for it to be capabie of

operating in the manner Intended by management.

Depreciation is charged so as to allocate the cost of assets less their residual value over their
estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method.

Depreciation Is provided on the following basis:

Freehold property - 2% straight line
Motor vehicles - 26% straight line
Fixtures and fittings - 10% - 33% straight line

The assets' residua! values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted
prospectively if appropriate, or if there is an indication of a significant change since the las! reporting
date,

Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount
and are recognised In profit or toss.

2.11 Impairment of fixed assets and goodwill

Assets that are subject to depreciation or amortisation are assessed at each balance sheet date to
determine whether there is any indication that the assets are impaired. Where there is any indication
that an asset may be Impaired, the carrying value of the asset (cr cash-generating unit to which the
asset has been allocated) is tested for impairment. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount
by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the
higher of an asset's (or CGU's) fair value less costs to sell and vatue in use. For the purposes of
assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately
identifiable cash flows (CGUs). Non-financial assets that have been previously impaired are reviewed
at each balance sheet date to assess whether there is any indication that the impairment losses
recognised in prior periods may no longer exist or may have decreased.

2.12 Valuation of investments

Investments In listed company shares are remeasured to market value at each Balance Sheet. Gains
and lasses on remeasurement are recognised in profit or toss for the period.

Notes to the Financial Statements
For the Year Ended 31 December 2023

2. Accounting policies (continued)

2.13 Stocks

Stocks are stated at the jower of cost and net realisable value, being the estimated selling price less
costs to complete and sell. Cost is based on the cost of purchase on a first in, first out basis. Work in
progress and finished goods include labour and attributable overheads.

At each balance sheet date, stocks are assessed for impairment. If stock is impaired, the carrying
amount is reduced to its selling price less costs to complete and sell. The impairment loss is
recognised immediately in profit or loss.

2.14 Debtors

Short-term debtors are measured at transaction price, less any impairment. Loans receivable are
measured initially at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are measured subsequently at amortised
cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment.

2.15 Cash and cash equivalents

Cash is represented by cash in hand and deposits with financial institutions repayable without penalty
on notice of not more than 24 hours. Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments that mature in no
more than three months from the date of acquisition and that are readily convertible to known
amounts of cash with insignificant risk of change in value.

2.16 Creditors

Short-term creditors are measured at the transaction price. Other financial liabilities, including bank
loans, are measured initially at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are measured subsequently at
amortised cost using the effective interest method.

2.17 Financial instruments

The Company only enters into basic financial instrument transactions that result in the recognition of
financial assets and liabilities like trade and other debtors and creditors, loans from banks and other
third parties, loans to related parties and investments in ordinary shares.

Debt instruments (other than those wholly repayable or receivable within one year), including loans
and other accounts receivable and payable, are initially measured at present value of the future cash
flows and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Debt instruments that
are payable or receivable within one year, typically trade debtors and creditors, are measured, initially
and subsequently, at the undiscounted amount of the cash or other consideration expected to be paid
or received. However, if the arrangements of a short-term instrument constitute a financing
transaction, like the payment of a trade debt deferred beyond normal business terms or in case of an
out-right short-term toan that is not at market rate, the financial asset or liability is measured, initially
at the present value of future cash flows discounted at a market rate of interest for a similar debt
instrument and subsequently at amortised cost, unless it qualifies as a loan from a director in the
case of a small company, or a public benefit entity concessionary loan.

Investments in non-derivative instruments that are equity to the issuer are measured:

. at fair value with changes recognised in the Statement of income and retained earings if
the shares are publicly traded or their fair value can otherwise be measured feliably;
. at cost less impairment for all other investments.

Financial liabilities are derecognised when the Company's contractual obligations expire or are

Judgements In applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty

In the application of the Company's accounting policies, which are described in note 2, the directors are
required to make judgments, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities that are not readily apparent from the other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions
are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may
differ from these estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting
estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised.

Critical judgment in applying the company’s accounting policies

The following are critical judgments that the directors have made in the process of applying the company's
accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the.amounts recognised in the financial
statements.

Estimates

intangible Assets

Costs incurred in the development of the company's software used to generate income are capitalised
once technical and commercial feasibility of the asset for use has been established. These costs are
capitalised in the period in which the costs are incurred.

Depreciation of Tangible Fixed Assets

Depreciation of tangible fixed assets has been based on estimated useful lives and residual values
deemed appropriate by the directors. Estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually
and revised as appropriate. Revisions take into account actual asset lives and residual values as
evidenced by disposals during current and prior accounting periods.

Trade Debtors

Estimates have also been made in relation to the calculation of trade debtor provisions. The calculation
tequired the company to estimate the net recoverable value in assessing if any provision against trade
debtors is required. The carrying value of trade debtors after provision at the balance sheet date was
£341,192 (2022: £495,392).

Employees

The average monthly number of employees, including directors, during the year was 44 (2022 - 47).

5. Intangible assets (continued)

Costs incurred in the development of the company's software used to generate income are capitalised in
the period in which the costs are incurred. The software is under continual improvement such that the
intangible asset is in use but under development simultaneously. The directors have selected a period of

thee to eleven years over which to amortise these development costs.

The remaining amortisation period can be analysed as follows:

Costs with 9-10 years remaining
Costs with 8-9 years remaining

‘Costs with 7-8 years remaining
Costs with 6-7 years remaining
Costs with 5-6 years remaining
Costs with 4-5 years remaining
Costs with 3-4 years remaining
Costs with 2-3 years remaining
Costs with 1-2 years remaining
Costs with less than 1 year remaining
