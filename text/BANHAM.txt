Statement of compliance

These Financia! Statement have been prepared in compliance with Section 1A of FRS 102, 'The
Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and the Republic of Ireland’.

Basis of preparation of financial statements

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention unless otherwise
specified within these accounting policies and in accordance with FRS 102 'The Financial Reporting
Standard applicable in the UK and the Republic of Ireland’ and the requirements of the Companies
Act 2006. The disclosure requirements of Section 1A of FRS 102 have been applied other than
where additional disclosure is required to show a true and fair view.

The Company's functional and presentational currency is GBP.

The preparation of financial statements in compliance with FRS 102 requires the use of certain
critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise judgment in applying the
Company's accounting policies (see note 3).

The following principal accounting policies have been applied:
Going concern

In preparing the financial statements, the directors have considered existing and available financial
resources and various trading scenarios for not less than 12 months from the date of approval of
these financial statements. In light of the Company's trading performance throughout 2023 and in the
beginning of 2024, and the sufficiency of available cash resources within the Company and wider
Group, the directors have concluded that it remains appropriate to continue to prepare these financial
statement on the going concern basis and have not identified a material uncertainty in this regard.

Revenue

Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the
Company and the revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is measured as the fair value of the
consideration received or receivable, excluding discounts, rebates, value added tax and other sales
taxes. The following criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised:

Rendering of services
Revenue from a contract to provide services is recognised in the period in which the services are

provided in accordance with the stage of completion of the contract when all of the following
conditions are satisfied:

. the amount of revenue can be measured reliably;

. it is probable that the Company will receive the consideration due under the contract;

. the stage of completion of the contract at the end of the reporting period can be measured
reliably; and

° the costs incurred and the costs to complete the contract can be measured reliably.

Accounting policies (continued)

2.7

Operating leases: the Company as lessee

Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the
lease term.

Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to sign an operating lease are recognised on a
straight-line basis over the lease term, unless another systematic basis is representative of the time
pattern of the lessee’s benefit from the use of the leased asset.

Pensions
Defined contribution pension plan

The Company operates a defined contribution plan for its employees. A defined contribution plan is a
pension plan under which the Company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. Once the
contributions have been paid the Campany has no further payment obligations.

The contributions are recognised as an expense in profit or loss when they fall due. Amounts not paid
are shown in accruals as a liability in the Statement of financial position. The assets of the plan are
held separately from the Company in independently administered funds.

Current and deferred taxation

The tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax. The tax expense for the year
comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in profit or loss except that a charge
attributable to an item of income and expense recognised as other comprehensive income or to an
item recognised directly in equity is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in
equity respectively.

The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of tax rates and laws that have been
enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date in the countries where the Company operates
and generates income.

Deferred tax balances are recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not
reversed by the reporting date, except that:

. The recognition of deferred tax assets is limited to the extent that it is probable that they will be
recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits; and
. Any deferred tax balances are reversed if and when all conditions for retaining associated tax

allowances have been met.

Deferred tax balances are not recognised in respect of permanent differences except in respect of
business combinations, when deferred tax is recognised on the differences between the fair values of
assets acquired and the future tax deductions available for them and the differences between the fair
values of liabilities acquired and the amount that will be assessed for tax. Deferred tax is determined
using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.

2.9

Intangible assets

Intangible assets are initially recognised at cost. After recognition, under the cost model, intangible
assets are measured at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment
losses.

At each reporting date the Company assesses whether there is any indication of impairment. If such
indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is determined which is the higher of its fair
value less costs to sell and its value in use. An impairment loss is recognised where the carrying
amount exceeds the recoverable amount.

All intangible assets are considered to have a finite useful life. If a reliable estimate of the useful life
cannot be made, the useful life shall not exceed ten years.

The estimated useful lives range as follows:

Computer Software - over 3-5 years
Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets under the cost model are stated at historical cost less accumulated
depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Historical cost includes expenditure that is
directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of
operating in the manner intended by management.
At each reporting date the Company assesses whether there is any indication of impairment. If such
indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is determined which is the higher of its fair
value less costs to sell and its value in use. An impairment loss is recognised where the carrying
amount exceeds the recoverable amount.

Depreciation is charged so as to allocate the cost of assets less their residual value over their
estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method.

Depreciation is provided on the foliowing basis:

Plant and machinery - Over 5 years
Fixtures and fittings - Over 5 years
Computer equipment - Over 5 years

The assets’ residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted
prospectively if appropriate, or if there is an indication of a significant change since the last reporting
date.

Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount
and are recognised in profit or loss.

2.10 Debtors

Short term debtors are measured at transaction price, less any impairment. Loans receivable are
measured initially at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are measured subsequently at amortised
cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment.

BANHAM ACADEMY LIMITED

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023

2.

Accounting policies (continued)

2.11 Cash and cash equivalents

Cash is represented by cash in hand and deposits with financial institutions repayable without penalty
on notice of not mare than 24 hours. Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments that mature in no
more than three months from the date of acquisition and that are readily convertible to known
amounts of cash with insignificant risk of change in value.

2.12 Creditors

Short term creditors are measured at the transaction price. Other financial liabilities, including bank
loans, are measured initially at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are measured subsequently at
amortised cost using the effective interest method.

2.13 Provisions for liabilities

Provisions are recognised when an event has taken place that gives rise to a legal or constructive
obligation, a transfer of economic benefits is probable and a reliable estimate can be made.

Provisions are measured as the best estimate of the amount required to settle the abligation, taking
into account the related risks and uncertainties.

Increases in provisions are generally charged as an expense to profit or loss.

2.14 Financial instruments

The Company only enters into basic financial instrument transactions that result in the recognition of
financial assets and liabilities like trade and other debtors and creditors, loans from banks and other
third parties, loans to related parties and investments in ordinary shares.

Debt instruments (other than those wholly repayable or receivable within one year), including loans
and other accounts receivable and payable, are initially measured at present value of the future cash
flows and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Debt instruments that
are payable or receivable within one year, typically trade debtors and creditors, are measured, initially
and subsequently, at the undiscounted amount of the cash or other consideration expected to be paid
or received. However, if the arrangements of a short-term instrument constitute a financing
transaction, like the payment of a trade debt deferred beyond normal business terms or in case of an
out-right short-term loan that is not at market rate, the financial asset or liability is measured, initially
at the present value of future cash flows discounted at a market rate of interest for a similar debt
instrument and subsequently at amortised cost, unless it qualifies as a joan from a director in the
case of a small company, or a public benefit entity concessionary loan.

Financial assets that are measured at cost and amortised cost are assessed at the end of each
reporting period for objective evidence of impairment. {f objective evidence of impairment is found, a
impairment loss is recognised in the Statement of Income and Retained Earnings.

For financial assets measured at amortised cost, the impairment loss is measured as the difference
between an asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated cash flows discounted at the
asset's original effective interest rate. If a financial asset has a variable interest rate, the discount rate
for measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest rate determined under the
contract.

For financial assets measured at cost less impairment, the impairment loss is measured as the
difference between an asset's carrying amount and best estimate of the recoverable amount, which is
an approximation of the amount that the Company woutd receive for the asset if it were to be sold at
the reporting date.

2.14 Financial instruments (continued)

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the Statement of Financial
Position when there is an enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an
intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

3. Judgments in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty

The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported. These estimates and judgements are continually reviewed
and are based on experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed
to be reasonable under the circumstances. No significant estimates have been used in the preparation of

these financial statements.

The average monthly number of employees, including directors, during the year was 8 (2022 - 5).
