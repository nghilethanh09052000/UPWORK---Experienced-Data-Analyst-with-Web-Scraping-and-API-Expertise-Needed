2. Accounting policies (continued)
2.3 Operating leases: the Company as lessee

Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the
lease term.

Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to sign an operating lease are recognised on a
straight-line basis over the lease term, unless another systematic basis is representative of the time
pattern of the lessee's benefit from the use of the leased asset.

¢

2.4 Government grants -
Grants are accounted under the accruals model as permitted by FRS 102. Grants relating to
expenditure on tangible fixed assets are credited to profit or loss at the same rate as the depreciation
on the assets to which the grant relates. The deferred element of grants is included in creditors as
deferred income. . : 1

Grants of a revenue nature are recognised in the Statement of comprehensive income in the same
period as the related expenditure.

2.5 Interest income
Interest income is recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method.

2.6 Finance costs
Finance costs are charged to profit or loss over the term of the debt using the effective interest
method so that the amount charged is at a constant rate on the carrying amount. Issue costs are
initially recognised as a reduction in the proceeds of the associated capital instrument.

2.7 . Pensions

, . Defined contribution pension plan

The Company operates a defined contribution plan for its employees. A defined contribution plan is a
pension plan under which the Company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. Once the
contributions have been paid the Company has no further payment obligations.

are shown in accruals as a liability in the Balance sheet. The assets of the plan are held separately
from the Company in independently administered funds.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

2. Accounting policies (continued)
2.8 Current and deferred taxation

The tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in profit or loss
except that a charge attributable to an item of income and expense recognised as other
comprehensive income or to an item recognised directly in equity is also recognised in other
comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.

The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of tax rates and laws that have been
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date in the countries where the Company
operates and generates income.

Deferred tax balances are recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not

reversed by the balance sheet date, except that:

° The recognition of deferred tax assets is limited to the extent that it is probable that they will be
recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits; and

° Any deferred tax balances are reversed if and when all conditions for retaining associated tax
allowances have been met.

Deferred tax balances are not recognised in respect of permanent differences except in respect of
business combinations, when deferred tax is recognised on the differences between the fair values of
assets acquired and the future tax deductions available for them and the differences between the fair
values of liabilities acquired and the amount that will be assessed for tax. Deferred tax is determined
using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.

2.9 Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets under the cost model are stated at historical cost less accumulated
depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Historical cost includes expenditure that is
directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of

operating in the manner intended by management.

Depreciation is charged so as to allocate the cost-of assets less their residual value over their
estimated useful lives, on the following basis.

Depreciation is provided on the following basis:

Short-term leasehold property - Over the lease term

Plant and machinery - 33% on straight line basis
Motor vehicles - 33% on straight line basis
Fixtures and fittings - 33% on straight line basis
Office equipment - 33% on straight line basis

The assets’ residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted
prospectively if appropriate, or if there is an indication of a significant change since the last reporting
date.

Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount
and are recognised in profit or loss.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2024

2. Accounting policies (continued)
2.10 Debtors

Short-term debtors are measured at transaction price, less any impairment. Loans receivable are
measured initially at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are measured subsequently at amortised
cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment.

2.11 Cash and cash equivalents

Cash is represented by cash in hand and deposits with financial institutions repayable without penalty

on notice of not more than 24 hours. Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments that mature in no

more than three months from the date of acquisition and that are ‘readily convertible to known
_ amounts of cash with insignificant risk of change in value.

* 2.12 Creditors

Short-term creditors are measured at the transaction price. Other financial liabilities, including bank
loans, are measured initially at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are measured subsequently at
amortised cost using the effective interest method.

2.13 Provisions for liabilities

Provisions are recognised when an event has taken place that gives rise to a legal or constructive
obligation, a transfer of economic benefits is probable and a reliable estimate can be made.

Provisions are measured as the best estimate of the amount required to settle the obligation, taking
into account the related risks and uncertainties.

Increases in provisions are generally charged as an expense to profit or loss.
2.14 Financial instruments

The Company has elected to apply the provisions of Section 11 “Basic Financial Instruments” of FRS
102 to all of its financial instruments.

Basic financial assets

Basic financial assets, which include trade and other debtors, cash and bank balarices, are initially
measured at their transaction price (adjusted for transaction costs except in the initial measurement
of financial assets that are subsequently measured at fair value through profit and loss) and are
subsequently carried at their amortised.cost using the effective interest method, less any provision for
impairment, unless the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where the transaction is
measured at the present value of the future receipts discounted at a market rate of interest.

Discounting is omitted where the effect of discounting is immaterial. The Company's cash and cash
equivalents, trade and most other debtors due with the operating cycle fall into this category of
financial instruments.

Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual

arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest i in
the assets of the Company after the deduction of all its liabilities.

2. Accounting policies (continued)
2.14 Financial instruments (continued)

Basic financial liabilities, which include trade and other creditors, bank loans and other loans are
initially measured at their transaction price (adjusting for transaction costs except in the initial
measurement of financial liabilities that are subsequently measured at fair value through profit and
loss). When this constitutes a financing transaction, whereby the debt instrument is measured at the
present value of the future payments discounted at a market rate of interest, discounting is omitted
where the effect of discounting is immaterial.

Debt instruments are subsequently carried at their amortised cost using the effective interest rate
method.

Trade creditors are obligations to pay for goods and services that have been acquired in the ordinary
course of business from suppliers. Trade creditors are classified as current liabilities if the payment is
due within one year. If not, they represent non-current liabilities. Trade creditors are initially
recognised at their transaction price and subsequently are measured at amortised cost using the
effective interest method. Discounting is omitted where the effect of discounting is immaterial.

3. Employees

The average monthly number of employees, including directors, during the year was 10 (2023 - 9).
