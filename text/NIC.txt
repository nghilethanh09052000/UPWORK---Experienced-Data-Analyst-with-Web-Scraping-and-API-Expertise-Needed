STRATEGIC REPORT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2024

The directors present the strategic report for the year ended 31 March 2024.

Fair review of the business .
The Directors are pleased to report a continued year on year growth in the year to March 2024.

Growth continues to come from both existing clients and through new opportunities in different market sectors.
This continued growth is a strategic target for NIC Services Group (NIC) with a provision of sustainable high levels
of customer service leading to organic growth opportunities. NIC also continues to explore diversification within
different Facilities Market Sectors. The board are pleased that there has been continued growth.

Whilst growing turnover significantly over the last few years there has been a continued focus on sustainable
profitability. Prior years have seen a re-investment of profits into support office, key Sales, Commercial and
Operations personnel to ensure the customer is delivered the highest possible level of services.

NIC has experienced significant challenges to profitability in the year. Recruitment of new colleagues has been a
challenge across the industry and beyond and this has led to increased costs in the year. Labour Agency costs have
been significant as NIC has sought to maintain the high level of service to our customers by ensuring a full service
provision delivery. In addition recruitment costs have increased and wage inflation has impacted with a continued
high percentage increase in National Minimum Wage. This impacts increases in the real living wage and also
differentials to keep colleagues at their grade levels above National Minimum Wage. NIC has also experienced
rising interest rates on borrowings which have impacted profitability.

To compliment a continued strategy of growth within the Facilities Management industry, NIC is also embarking on
an acquisition strategy. Grants Cleaning Services has been added to the group and NIC continues to look for
further opportunities in 2024/2025. ,


NIC SERVICES GROUP LIMITED

STRATEGIC REPORT (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2024

Principal risks and uncertainties

The Group uses various financial instruments, which include invoice discounting, cash and other items such as
trade debtors and trade creditors that arise directly fram its operations. The main purpose of these financial
instruments is to raise finance for the Group's operations.

The existence of these financial instruments exposes the Group to a number of financial risks. These are liquidity
risk, credit risk and interest risk. The directors review and agree policies for managing each of these risks and they
are summarised below.

Interest rate risk

The Group finances specific plant acquisitions via hire purchase contracts secured specifically on assets being
acquired. Therefore hire purchase interest rates are monitored regularly to ensure that the business secures the
most competitive rates available. There has been increased focus in this area during the year due to rising interest
rates. The Group does not hedge its interest rate risk.

Price risk

The Group uses short term contracts with suppliers and customers to manage its exposure to variations in market
prices.

Credit risk

The group's debtors relate to amounts owed by UK corporates. Given the size and stability of the core debtors, the
directors do not believe that credit risk to the Group is significant. However, the directors monitor any default risk
on an ongoing basis. The Group uses normal credit management processes to monitor its credit risk.

Liquidity
The Group seeks to manage financial risk by ensuring sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs, by

the use of invoice discounting facilities, and to invest cash assets safely and profitably. Management control and
monitor the Group's cash flow on a regular basis.

Key performance indicators
Gross Profit Value

2024 - £16,664k (2023 - £14,592k)

NIC recognises that competition becomes tougher year on year and the economic climate dictates that the
percentage gross margin is squeezed. Consequently, NIC measures the growth in business by the gross profit cash
value and therefore contribution to overhead and administration costs.

Debt Turn
2024 - 65 days (2023 - 65 days)

Constantly measuring cash receipts is a key contro! of any business. Debtor days measurement allows NIC to keep
control over days of outstanding debt and consequently "cash turn" in the business. Extended blue chip
organisations contract payment terms increases the measure which creates interest costs on working capital
borrowings.

Current Ratio
2024 - 1.02 (2023 - 1.03)

Measure of our liquid assets against liabilities falling due within the next 12 months. The current year is above the
target measure of 1.


NIC SERVICES GROUP LIMITED

STRATEGIC REPORT (CONTINUED}
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2024

Other performance indicators
Senior Management Retention

2024 - 100% (2023 - 100%)

To attract and retain the appropriate level of senior management to drive the strategic direction of NIC.
Management numbers have increased with full retention of all senior management from the prior year.

Customer Retention/Growth
2024 - Gain of 62 (2023 - Gain of 1)

To grow our customer base year on year in order to diversify and spread risk. 2023/2024 has seen combined new
business and acquired growth from the integration of Grants Cleaning Services customers.


NIC SERVICES GROUP LIMITED

STRATEGIC REPORT (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2024

Directors’ statement of compliance with duty to promote the success of the Group
In accordance with section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 each of our directors acts in a way that they consider,
in good faith, would most likely promote the success of NIC for the benefit of its stakeholders as a whole.

The Directors are aware of how important building and maintaining successful relationships with stakeholders are
to the business., be it employees, customers, suppliers and with the wider community. In making decisions, the
Directors take account not only of the short-term requirements of the business but also of the longer-term impact
on these stakeholders.

The Directors consider the combined team's breadth of experience and knowledge to be strong enough to be able
to discharge collective obligations thoroughly. As a business we aim to not only meet our objectives but exceed
them. Our strategy involves continuous heavy investment in technology and innovation which will help to
differentiate us from the competition. ,

All directors are heavily involved in the regular management of the business, and the executive team holds its own
regular meetings, as well as meeting regularly with Heads of Department and the wider management team. Any
operational and strategic decisions are debated in this environment on a democratic basis to ensure management
have input in the best way to execute on strategy. The directors believe that this process spreads the risk and
ensures that decisions made are fair and balanced in the context of all business and stakeholder priorities.

Engagement with Employees

NIC has clearly displayed core values with the aim to instil these beliefs across NIC and employees. NIC operates
an employee recognition scheme ‘Pride of NIC’ which aims to promote these values.

NIC operates performance appraisals and work levelling which sets objectives and identifies training and
development requirements. This employee strategy also identifies where support is required and allows NIC to set
career paths and identify promotional opportunities.

The acquisition in the year of Worldweaver Training and Development Limited has allowed NIC to meet training
and development requirements of employees internally.

Engagement with suppliers, customers and others

Delivering our strategy requires strong mutually beneficial relationships with customers and suppliers. The
directors continually discuss the relationships with both customers and suppliers alike.

Engagement with our customers is essential. NIC aim to build strong strategic partnerships with our customers
with the aim of being their supplier of choice. We offer our services as a package to meet all our customers’
needs. Providing our customers with services they require, at the right time is imperative to building and
maintaining our relationship.

NIC identify key strategic suppliers and have regular review meetings which talk about strategic plans, innovation
and how they can provide support going forwards, especially if new technology is involved. Working closely with
suppliers in this way helps to establish a strong long-term relationship to ensure that an effective and fair balance
is achieved.

Statement of Corporate Governance Arrangements

This Corporate Governance statement has been prepared in accordance with the principles of the UK Corporate
Governance Code. NIC have adopted the UK Corporate Governance Code and applied this in the financial year to
31st March 2024. The Board has carried out a review of how the Code principles have been applied, and considers
that the Group has complied with the relevant provisions of the Code throughout the year in ail its material
aspects.

There has not been any departures from the UK Corporate Governance Code,

DIRECTORS' REPORT

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2024

The directors present their annual report and financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2024.

Principal activities
The principal activity of the company and group continued to be that of facilities support services.

Results and dividends
The results for the year are set out on page 14.

No ordinary dividends were paid. The directors do not recommend payment of a further dividend.

Directors
The directors who held office during the year and up to the date of signature of the financial statements were as
follows:

Mr S R Tidswell
Mr KH Atherton
MrJ D Spencer

Future developments
Innovation is at the forefront of future developments for NIC as we look to use technological advances to provide
clients with improved services for less cost and ultimately best value.

NIC has continued to invest in innovation. There is a continuation of investment to introduce the latest technology,
latest concepts and environmentally friendly products, systems and machinery that provide customers with
improved services. Innovation days are held at NIC's training academy where suppliers are able to showcase their
latest developments and add value for the client as well as complimenting NIC's policy of working in a green
environment.

Continual investment in innovation, technology and management across the business has proved successful as
measured by the continued growth not just in 2023/2024 but also the new financial year.

Recruitment continues to be challenging through a reduced pool of available labour and this is forecast to
continue posing challenges for the future. This is industry wide within Facilities Management and stretches across
other industry sectors too.

2023/2024 has seen a further investment in an Acquisitions team at NIC which has presented opportunities for
expansion. These opportunities have the potential for diversification into different market sectors to the current
customer base. A further acquisition was completed in the year of a training and development company. This gives
resource to NIC for upskilling its workforce to meet customer needs. It also provides industry purpose accredited
training for customer colleagues as well as internal colleagues to NIC. There is a healthy pipeline of opportunities
in the new financial year.

Diversification is also key for the future development of NIC. NIC provides not just a services provision to meet
client's facilities requirements but also a range of products to help our clients offer their customers and employees
the most hygienic environment possible.


NIC SERVICES GROUP LIMITED

DIRECTORS' REPORT (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2024

Auditor
During the year, Azets Audit Services Limited resigned as the Company's and Group's auditors and Armstrong
Watson Audit Limited were subsequently appointed to fill the vacancy arising.

The auditors, Armstrong Watson Audit Limited, will be proposed for reappointment in accordance with section
485 of the Companies Act 2006.

Energy and carbon report
The Group's greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption for the year were the equivalent of 1,119,257kg
(2023 - 1,282,625kg) of CO2 and the energy consumption was 4,592,741 kwh (2023 - 5,253,881kwh).

As a service company, the majority of our energy use is through fuel in our vehicle fleet. There is no onsite process
use and buildings energy use is quite small, with electricity being used mainly for lighting and IT all year round and
hot water generation in the summer when the gas boiler is turned off. Gas is used for space heating in the winter
months through a wet radiator system. The declared figures have been calculated by using the actual fuel
consumption and energy invoices received.

NIC is committed to operate as efficiently as possible and reduce our carbon footprint in the future. We have
achieved accreditation from Planet Mark and hope to use this to help us achieve our long term goals. A number of
initiatives are in hand to reduce fuel usage and emissions. These include the use of telematics to reduce fuel usage,
and improve driver behaviour, the introduction of routing software, the roll out of hybrid and electric vehicles and
the installation of electric charging stations at NIC's main office.

NIC has chosen to use full time equivalent staff numbers as a normalising factor to measure emissions over
periods and provide comparable data between other companies. The intensity ration for the year to 31st March
2024 is therefore 168kg (2023 - 167kg) of CO2 per full time equivalent employee.

Statement of disclosure to auditor
Each of the persons who are directors at the time when this Directors' Report is approved has confirmed that:

- so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit: information of which the Company and the Group's
auditors.are unaware, and

- the director has taken all the steps that ought to have been taken as a director in order to be aware of any
relevant audit information and to establish that the Company and the Group's auditors are aware of that
information.

Matters covered in the Group Strategic Report

Information is not shown in the directors’ report because it is shown in the strategic report instead under
$414C(11). The strategic report includes a business review, principal risks and uncertainties and financial key
performance indicators.

Director


NIC SERVICES GROUP LIMITED

DIRECTORS' RESPONSIBILITIES STATEMENT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2024

The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with
applicable law and regulations.

Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the
directors have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company law
the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair
view of the state of affairs of the group and company, and of the profit or loss of the group for that period. In
preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:

select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;

make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;

state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material
departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements;

prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the
group and company will continue in business.

The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the
group’s and company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of
the group and company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act
2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the group and company and hence for taking
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.


NIC SERVICES GROUP LIMITED

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF NIC SERVICES GROUP LIMITED

Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of NIC Services Group Limited the parent company and its subsidiaries
(the 'Group'} for the year ended 31 March 2024 which comprise the Group statement of comprehensive income,
the Group and company balance sheet, the Group and company statement of changes in equity, the Group
statement of cash flows and notes to the financial statements, including significant accounting policies. The
financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom
Accounting Standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 102 The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in
the UK and Republic of Ireland (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

In our opinion the financial statements:
* give a true and fair view of the state of the group's and the parent company’s affairs as at 31 March 2024 and
of the group's profit for the year then ended;
« have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice;
and
+ have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable
law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit
of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the group in accordance with the ethical
requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical
Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We
believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Conclusions relating to going concern .
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters to which the ISAs (UK) require us to report to you
where:

« the director's use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is not
appropriate; or;

« the director has not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast
significant doubt about the Group's or the parent Company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern
basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve months from the date when the financial statements are
authorised for issue.

Other information

The director is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in
the Annual Report, other than the financial statements and our Auditor's report thereon. Our opinion on the
financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in
our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in
doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our
knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material
inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material
misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the
work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are
required to report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.

NIC SERVICES GROUP LIMITED

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT (CONTINUED)
TO THE MEMBERS OF NIC SERVICES GROUP LIMITED

Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of our audit:
* the information given in the Group strategic report and the directors' report for the financial year for which
the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
« the Group strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal
requirements.

Matters on which we are required to report by exception

in the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the parent company and its environment
obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the group strategic report
and the directors’ report.

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to
report to you if, in our opinion:

« adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit
have not been received from branches not visited by us; or

« the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or

* certain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or

« we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

Responsibilities of directors

As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such
internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Groups and parent
company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and
using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the company or to cease
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from
fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected
to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these finaricial statements.

Extent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in
jine with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities,
including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is
detailed below:

-W-

NIC SERVICES GROUP LIMITED

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT (CONTINUED)
TO THE MEMBERS OF NIC SERVICES GROUP LIMITED

Our approach to identifying and assessing risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including
fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations, was as follows:

* The engagement partner ensured that the engagement team collectively had the appropriate
competence, capabilities and skills to identify or recognise non-compliance with applicable laws and
regulations;

« We identified the laws and regulations applicable to the Group through discussions with directors and
other management and review of appropriate industry knowledge;

« We assessed the extent of compliance with the laws and regulations identified above through making
enquiries of management; and

« Identified laws and regulations were communicated within the audit team regularly and the team
remained alert to instances of non-compliance throughout the audit.

We assessed the susceptibility of the Groups financial statements to material misstatement, including obtaining an
understanding of how fraud might occur, by:

* Making enquiries of management as to where they considered there was susceptibility to fraud, their
knowledge of actual, suspected and alleged fraud; and

« Considering the internal controls in place to mitigate risks of fraud and non-compliance with laws and
regulations.

To address the risk of fraud through management bias and override of controls, we:

+ Performed analytical procedures as a risk assessment tool to identify any unusual or unexpected
relationships;

« Tested journal entries to identify unusual transactions; and tested the operating effectiveness of key
controls over purchase cycles on a sample basis.

» Reviewed the application of accounting policies with focus on those with heightened estimation
uncertainty.

in response to the risk of irregularities and non-compliance with laws and regulations, we designed procedures
which included, but were not limited to:

« Agreeing financial statement disclosures to underlying supporting documentation; and

« Enquiring of management as to actual and potential litigation and claims.

Due to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk that we may not have detected some
material misstatements in the financial statements, even though we have properly planned and performed our
audit in accordance with auditing standards. For example, as with any audit, there remained a higher risk of non-
detection of irregularities, as these may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or
the override of internal controls. We are not responsible for preventing fraud or non-compliance with laws and
regulations and cannot be expected to detect all fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations. .

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial
Reporting Council's website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our
Auditors' Report.

Accounting policies

Company information
NIC Services Group Limited (“the company”) is a private limited company domiciled and incorporated in
England and Wales. The registered office is Hoyland House, Forge Lane, Leeds, LS12 2HG.

The company is a private company limited by shares, incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The company is a tax resident in the United Kingdom.

The group consists of NIC Services Group Limited and all of its subsidiaries.

Accounting convention

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 102 “The Financial Reporting
Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland” (“FRS 102”) and the requirements of the Companies
Act 2006.

The financial statements are prepared in sterting, which is the functional currency of the company. Monetary
amounts in these financial statements are rounded to the nearest £.

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention. The principal accounting
policies adopted are set out below.

The company is a qualifying entity for the purposes of FRS 102, being a member of a group where the parent
of that group prepares publicly available consolidated financial statements, including this company, which
are intended to give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the
group. The company has therefore taken advantage of exemptions from the following disclosure
requirements for parent company information presented within the consolidated financial statements:

« Section 7 ‘Statement of Cash Flows’: Presentation of a statement of cash flow and related notes and
disclosures;

« Section 11 ‘Basic Financial instruments’ and Section 12 ‘Other Financial Instrument Issues: Interest
income/expense and net gains/losses for financial instruments not measured at fair value; basis of
determining fair values; details of collateral, loan defaults or breaches, details of hedges, hedging
fair value changes recognised in profit or loss and in other comprehensive income;

« Section 26 ‘Share based Payment’: Share-based payment expense charged to profit or loss,
reconciliation of opening and closing number and weighted average exercise price of share options,
how the fair value of options granted was measured, measurement and carrying amount of
liabilities for cash-settled share-based payments, exptanation of modifications to arrangements;

e Section 33 ‘Related Party Disclosures’: Compensation for key management personnel.

1.3

Accounting policies . (Continued)

The Company has taken advantage of the exemption allowed under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006
and has not prepared its own Statement of Comprehensive Income in these financial statements.

The Company is the parent undertaking of a large sized group and as such is required by legislation to
prepare consolidated group accounts.

The entities included in this consotidation are NIC Property Services LLP and NIC Services (Gibraltar) Limited.

The Company has provided a corporate guarantee in respect of the liabilities of these companies as at 31
March 2024.

Business combinations

In the parent company financial statements, the cost of a business combination is the fair value at the
acquisition date of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed, plus costs
directly attributable to the business combination. The excess of the cost of a business combination over the
fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired is recognised as goodwill.
The cost of the combination includes the estimated amount of contingent consideration that is probable and
can be measured reliably, and is adjusted for changes in contingent consideration after the acquisition date.
Provisional fair values recognised for business combinations in previous periods are adjusted retrospectively
for final fair values determined in the 12 months following the acquisition date. Investments in subsidiaries,
joint ventures and associates are accounted for at cost less impairment.

Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the value of assets {other than goodwill) and liabilities
recognised in a business combination accounted for using the purchase method and the amounts that can
be deducted or assessed for tax, considering the manner in which the carrying amount of the asset or
liability is expected to be recovered or settled. The deferred tax recognised is adjusted against goodwill or
negative goodwill.

Basis of consolidation

The consolidated group financial statements consist of the financial statements of the parent company NIC
Services Group Limited together with all entities controlled by the parent company (its subsidiaries) and the’
group’s share of its interests in joint ventures and associates.

All financial statements are made up to 31 March 2024. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the
financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by other
members of the group.

All intra-group transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies are
eliminated on consolidation. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence
of an impairment of the asset transferred.

Subsidiaries are consolidated in the group’s financial statements from the date that control commences until
the date that control ceases.

Accounting policies (Continued)

Entities in which the group holds an interest and which are jointly controlled by the group and one or more
other venturers under a contractual arrangement are treated as joint ventures. Entities other than subsidiary
undertakings or joint ventures, in which the group has a participating interest and over whose operating and
financial policies the group exercises a significant influence, are treated as associates.

Investments in joint ventures and associates are carried in the group statement of financial position at cost
plus post-acquisition changes in the group’s share of the net assets of the entity, less any impairment in
value. The carrying values of investments in joint ventures and associates include acquired goodwill.

If the group’s share of losses in a joint venture or associate equals or exceeds its investment in the joint
venture or associate, the group does not recognise further losses unless it has incurred obligations to do so
or has made payments on behalf of the joint venture or associate.

Unrealised gains arising from transactions with joint ventures and associates are eliminated to the extent of
the group’s interest in the entity.

Going concern
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.

The Group and Company meet their day to day working capital requirements through existing credit
facilities. The group and Company have a considerable number of contracts, of which a significant
proportion have longevity of being serviced for a number of years. These contracts are spread across
different geographic areas and business markets. As a consequence the directors believe the Group and
company are well placed to manage their business risks successfully.

The directors have prepared forecasts and are confident that the Group and Company have adequate
resources to meet its liabilities as they fall due. As such, the directors consider it is appropriate to prepare
the financial statements on a going concern basis.

Turnover

Turnover is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods and services
provided in the normal course of business, and is shown net of VAT and other sales related taxes, The fair
value of consideration takes into account trade discounts, settlement discounts and volume rebates.

When cash inflows are deferred and represent a financing arrangement, the fair value of the consideration is
the present value of the future receipts. The difference between the fair value of the consideration and the
nominal amount received is recognised as interest income.

Revenue in respect of contracts undertaken by franchisee entities is recognised in these accounts on the
basis that the group acts as principal not agent. Revenue for services is recognised in the month the service
is provided and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.

Royalty revenue is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the company and
the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.

Intangible fixed assets - goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition of a business over the fair value of net assets
acquired. It is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less accumulated
amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is considered to have a finite useful life and is
amortised on a systematic basis over its expected life, which is 10 years.

For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the cash-generating units expected to
benefit from the acquisition. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for
impairment at least annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
if the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the
impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and
then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.

Intangible fixed assets other than goodwill
Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are recognised at cost and are subsequently measured
at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.

Intangible assets acquired on business combinations are recognised separately from goodwill at the
acquisition date where it is probable that the expected future economic benefits that are attributable to the
asset will flow to the entity and the fair value of the asset can be measured reliably; the intangible asset
arises from contractual or other legal rights; and the intangible asset is separable from the entity.

Amortisation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over
their useful lives on the following bases:

Software 25% straight line
Tangible fixed assets

Tangible fixed assets are initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost or valuation, net of
depreciation and any impairment losses.

' Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over

their useful lives on the following bases:

Freehold fand and buildings 2% straight line

Leasehold land and buildings over the period of the lease
Plant and equipment 17 - 50% straight line
Computers 33% straight line

Motor vehicles 25% reducing balance
Assets under construction not depreciated

The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the sale
proceeds and the carrying value of the asset, and is recognised in the income statement.

Investment properties

Investment property, which is property held to earn rentals and/or for capital appreciation, is initially
recognised at cost, which includes the purchase cost and any directly attributable expenditure. Subsequently
it is measured at fair value at the reporting end date. Fair value is determined internally by the Directors
annually and derived from current market rents and investment property yields for comparable real estate.
No depreciation is provided. Changes in fair value are recognised in profit or loss.

Fixed asset investments

Equity investments are measured at fair value through profit or loss, except for those equity investments
that are not publicly traded and whose fair value cannot otherwise be measured reliably, which are
recognised at cost less impairment until a reliable measure of fair value becomes available.

In the parent company financial statements, investments in subsidiaries, associates and jointly controlled
entities are initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment
losses.

A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the group. Control is the power to govern the financial and operating
policies of the entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.

An associate is an entity, being neither a subsidiary nor a joint venture, in which the company holds a long-
term interest and where the company has significant influence. The group considers that it has significant
influence where it has the power to participate in the financial and operating decisions of the associate.

Investments in associates are initially recognised at the transaction price (including transaction costs) and
are subsequently adjusted to reflect the group’s share of the profit or loss, other comprehensive income and
equity of the associate using the equity method. Any difference between the cost of acquisition and the
share of the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the associate on acquisition is recognised as goodwill.
Any unamortised balance of goodwill is included in the carrying value of the investment in associates.

Losses in excess of the carrying amount of an investment in an associate are recorded as a provision only
when the company has incurred legal or constructive obligations or has made payments on behalf of the

associate.

In the parent company financial statements, investments in associates are accounted for at cost less
impairment.

Entities in which the group has a long term interest and shares control under a contractual arrangement are
classified as jointly controlled entities.

Other non financial fixed asset investments (such as chattels and art work) are initially recognised at
acquisition cost and adjusted at each financial year end to fair value.

Impairment of fixed assets

At each reporting period end date, the group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible
assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If
any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent
of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual
asset, the company estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset
belongs.

The carrying amount of the investments accounted for using the equity method is tested for impairment as a
single asset. Any goodwill included in the carrying amount of the investment is not tested separately for
impairment.

Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use,
the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which
the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.

If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying
amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An
impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued
amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.

Recognised impairment losses are reversed if, and only if, the reasons for the impairment loss have ceased to
apply. Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-
generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased
carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment
loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is
recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which
case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.

Stocks

Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell. Cost
comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been
incurred in bringing the stocks to their present location and condition.

Stocks held for distribution at no or nominal consideration are measured at the lower of cost and
replacement cost, adjusted where applicable for any loss of service potential.

At each reporting date, an assessment is made for impairment. Any excess of the carrying amount of stocks
over its estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell is recognised as an impairment loss in profit or
loss. Reversals of impairment losses are also recognised in profit or loss.

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents are basic financial assets and include cash in hand, deposits held at call with
banks, other short-term liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, and bank
overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities.

Financial instruments
The group has elected to apply the provisions of Section 11 ‘Basic Financial Instruments’ and Section 12
‘Other Financial Instruments Issues’ of FRS 102 to all of its financial instruments.

Financial instruments are recognised in the group's statement of financial position when the group becomes
party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amounts presented in the financial statements when
there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a
net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Basic financial assets

Basic financial assets, which include debtors and cash and bank balances, are initially measured at
transaction price including transaction costs and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the
effective interest method unless the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where the transaction
is measured at the present value of the future receipts discounted at a market rate of interest. Financial
assets classified as receivable within one year are not amortised.

Other financial assets

Other financial assets, including investments in equity instruments which are not subsidiaries, associates or
joint ventures, are initially measured at fair value, which is normally the transaction price. Such assets are
subsequently carried at fair value and the changes in fair value are recognised in profit or loss, except that
investments in equity instruments that are not publicly traded and whose fair values cannot be measured
reliably are measured at cost less impairment.

Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets, other than those held at fair value through profit and loss, are assessed for indicators of
impairment at each reporting end date.

Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that
occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows have been
affected. If an asset is impaired, the impairment loss is the difference between the carrying amount and the
present value of the estimated cash flows discounted at the asset’s original effective interest rate. The
impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss.

lf there is a decrease in the impairment loss arising from an event occurring after the impairment was
recognised, the impairment is reversed. The reversal is such that the current carrying amount does not
exceed what the carrying amount would have been, had the impairment not previously been recognised.
The impairment reversal is recognised in profit or loss.

Derecognition of financial assets

Financial assets are derecognised only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or
are settled, or when the group transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership to another entity, or if some significant risks and rewards of ownership are retained but control of
the asset has transferred to another party that is able to sell the asset in its entirety to an unrelated third

party.

Classification of financial liabilities

Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual
arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the
assets of the group after deducting all of its liabilities.

Basic financial liabilities

Basic financial liabilities, including creditors, bank loans, loans from fellow group companies and preference
shares that are classified as debt, are initially recognised at transaction price unless the arrangement
constitutes a financing transaction, where the debt instrument is measured at the present value of the
future payments discounted at a market rate of interest. Financial liabilities classified as payable within one
year are not amortised.

Debt instruments are subsequently carried at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.

Trade creditors are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of
business from suppliers. Amounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one
year or less. If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities. Trade creditors are recognised initially at
transaction price and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

Other financial liabilities

Debt instruments that do not meet the conditions in FRS 102 paragraph 11.9 are subsequently measured at
fair value through profit or loss. Debt instruments may be designated as being measured at fair value
through profit or toss to eliminate or reduce an accounting mismatch or if the instruments are measured and
their performance evaluated on a fair value basis in accordance with a documented risk management or
investment strategy.

Derecognition of financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the group's contractual obligations expire or are discharged or
cancelled.

Equity instruments

Equity instruments issued by the group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of transaction costs.
Dividends payable on equity instruments are recognised as liabilities once they are no longer at the
discretion of the group.

Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.

Current tax

The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as
reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or
deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The group’s
liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the
reporting end date.

Deferred tax

Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all timing differences and deferred tax assets are
recognised to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax
liabilities or other future taxable profits. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the timing difference
arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects
neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting end date and reduced to the extent
that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to
be recovered. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the
liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except
when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt
with in equity. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if, and only if, there is a legally enforceable right to
offset current tax assets and liabilities and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the
same tax authority.

Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the group has a legal or constructive present obligation as a result of a past
event, it is probable that the group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be
made of the amount of the obligation.

The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present
obligation at the reporting end date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the
obligation. Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount expected to be required to
settle the obligation is recognised at present value. When a provision is measured at present value, the
unwinding of the discount is recognised as a finance cost in profit or loss in the period in which it arises.

Employee benefits
The costs of short-term employee benefits are recognised as a liability and an expense, unless those costs
are required to be recognised as part of the cost of stock or fixed assets.

The cost of any unused holiday entitlement is recognised in the period in which the employee’s services are
received.

Termination benefits are recognised immediately as an expense when the company is demonstrably
committed to terminate the employment of an employee or to provide termination benefits.

Retirement benefits
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fail due.

Leases
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and
rewards of ownership to the lessees. All other leases are classified as operating leases.

Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets at the lower of the assets fair value at the date of
inception and the present value of the minimum lease payments. The related liability is included in the
statement of financial position as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are treated as consisting of
capital and interest elements. The interest is charged to profit or loss so as to produce a constant periodic
rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.

Rentals payable under operating leases, including any lease incentives received, are charged to profit or loss
on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease except where another more systematic basis is
more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed.

Foreign exchange

Transactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing at the
dates of the transactions. At each reporting end date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated
in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the reporting end date. Gains and losses
arising on translation in the period are included in profit or Joss.

Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty

In the application of the group’s accounting policies, the directors are required to make judgements,
estimates and assumptions about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other
factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting
estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised where the revision affects only that
period, or in the period of the revision and future periods where the revision affects both current and future
periods.

Critical judgements
The following judgements (apart from those involving estimates) have had the most significant effect on
amounts recognised in the financial statements.

Fair Value of investment property

The fair value of investment properties are ascertained by reference to location, market conditions,
unexpired length and terms of the tenants lease, the tenants financial strength and comparable real estate
yields. This is an internal valuation completed by the directors.

Accruals

Accruals are made for expenditure incurred but for which an invoice has not been received at the financial
year end. Where post year end invoices have not been received management have used their judgement to
determine the appropriate accrual.

2 Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty (Continued)
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The estimates and assumptions which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying
amount of assets and liabilities are as follows.

Useful economic lives of tangible assets

The annual depreciation charge for tangible assets is sensitive to changes in the estimated useful economic
lives and residual values of the assets. The useful economic lives and residual values are re-assessed
annually, They are amended when necessary to reflect current estimates, based on technological
advancement, future investments, economic utilisation and physical condition of the assets. See note 11 for
the carrying amount of the tangible assets, and note 1.7 for the useful economic lives for each class of assets
including change in accounting estimate.

Impairment of debtors

The Group and Company make an estimate of the recoverable value of trade and other debtors. When
assessing impairment of trade and other debtors, management considers factors including the current credit
rating of the debtor, the aging profile of debtors and historical experience. See note 16 for net carrying
amount of the debtors and associated impairment provision.
