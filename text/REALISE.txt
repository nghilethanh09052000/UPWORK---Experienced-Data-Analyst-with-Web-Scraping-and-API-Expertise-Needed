Strategic Report
For the Year Ended 31 December 2023

The directors present their strategic report for the year ended 31 December 2023
REVIEW OF THE BUSINESS

The underlying results of the business have increased by 5% from an adjusted EBITDA of £1,549,385 (excluding
exceptional costs) in 2022 to an adjusted EBITDA of £1,626,622 in 2023. This improvement of £77,237 has been
driven by a continued focus on delivering the strategy of “right learner, right programme” throughout the
business which inherently drives better quality. Turnover has increased by 21.2% from £17,597,15 in 2022 to
£21,326,225 in 2023.

In the summer of 2023, Realise made investments in mobilising 10 adult learning contracts, amounting to an
annualised value of £7 million. This strategic move reflects Realise's commitment to diversifying its revenue
streams, prioritising adult learning and bootcamps to reduce reliance on apprenticeships.

During 2023 there were challenges in the transport sector which led to revenue in the sector reducing from
£57m in 2022 to £3.5m in 2023 and this correlates with the reduction in funded learner numbers In transport
which reduced throughout 2023 from 905 apprenticeship funded learners at 31 December 2022 to 170 at 31
December 2023. This challenge has now passed, with learner numbers increasing in 2024 across a more
diverse customer base.

The investment in the new adult learning contracts coupled with increasing apprenticeship learner starts In
transport and continued strong performance in our early years and education sector has driven the strong start
‘© the 2024 financial year. For the 6 month period ending 30 June 2024 Realise has already achieved revenue
and EBITDA of £13.8m and £1.9m respectively

In addition to its financial successes and strategic initiatives, Realise achieved a notable milestone in July 2023
with a successful Ofsted visit, The organisation attained a rating of Good in all areas, underscoring its
commitment to excellence in education and training delivery This accomplishment holds particular significance
considering the complex landscape of multiple funding streams managed by Realise. The positive assessment
rom Ofsted not only validates Realise’s dedication to quality but also enhances its reputation as a reliable
provider of education and training services.

APPRENTICESHIPS

Realise’s strategic approach to apprenticeships revolves around identifying and addressing the need for
regulated training in key sectors. Leveraging our expertise, we have cultivated enduring relationships with both
private and public sector clients, establishing ourselves as a trusted provider of high-quality apprenticeship
programmes. Our commitment to delivering excellence Is evident across various industries, including early years
and education, health and social care, transport, and business services. Notably, our early years apprenticeship
provision has experienced remarkable growth, positioning Realise as the number one provider in this domain for
he 2022/2023 academic year. This achievement not only reflects our responsiveness to market demands but
also underscores our dedication to nurturing skilled professionals in critical sectors.

Moreover, Realise takes pride in its commitment to quality assurance. As a testament to our unwavering
standards, we attained the highest independent rating in the qualification success rates (QAR) for SAAI (Health
and Care) among large providers with over 1000 apprentices This highlights our ability to consistently deliver
exceptional training and support services. By prioritising quality and innovation, Realise continues to uphold its
reputation as a leading force in apprenticeship training, ernpowering learners to unlock their full potential and
achieve their career aspirations.

Strategic Report
For the Year Ended 31 December 2023

ADULT EDUCATION

In 2023, Realise achieved remarkable success by securing 10 new adult learning contracts, with a combined
annual contract value of £7 million. These contracts commenced in 2023 and cover key regions including
Greater Manchester, Non-Devolved areas, West Yorkshire, and the West Midlands. This significant
accomplishment not only solidifies Realise's position as a leading provider of adult education but also
underscores our commitment to delivering high-quality training solutions across diverse communities.

Furthermore, in late 2023, Realise achieved another noteworthy milestone by winning a contract for an Early
Years Apprenticeship Accelerator Bootcamp. This innovative program, which commenced in February 2024,
serves as a testament to Realise's dedication to enhancing opportunities for early years education and
professional development. By launching initiatives like these, Realise continues to demonstrate its proactive
approach to meeting the evolving needs of learners and businesses alike, positioning us for continued growth
and impact in the years ahead

Looking ahead to 2024, Realise sees a significant pipeline of further adult education and bootcamp tenders
Given our success rate in 2023, we expect these opportunities to play a pivotal role in our continued growth
trajectory. Already, we have secured 10 new contracts for adult learning and bootcamps in 2024 with a combined
contract value of £2.4m, a testament to our ongoing commitment to expanding our reach and delivering
exceptional training solutions.

In our established adult education regions, we continue to deliver full contract values and achieve contract
growth, demonstrating the effectiveness of our programs and the trust placed in us by our partners.
Furthermore, we are continuing to invest in areas of high deprivation, with a new skills hub now open in Blackpool
in 2024. This addition brings Realise’s total number of skills huos across the UK to 7, further solidifying our
commitment to addressing educational inequality and empowering individuals in communities nationwide. As
we forge ahead, Realise remains dedicated to driving positive change through education and training, making a
tangible difference in the lives of learners and the prosperity of businesses across the country

Strategic Report
For the Year Ended 31 December 2023

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
The management of the company's business and the execution of the company's strategy are subject to a
nurnber of risks.

Government Policy
The Company generates a significant majority of its turnover from government funded sources either directly or

via devolved funds. Changes to government policy in respect of devolution, adult education, apprenticeship levy
or SME apprenticeships is a risk facing the company. However, we also consider this to represent an opportunity
given our diversified funding streams. We note specifically the on-going pilot of reviewing apprenticeship
andard funding bands and funding rules for apprenticeships.

Qn

lection 2024

With the recent change in government in July 2024, such a change could bring about revisions to policies
concerning the apprenticeship levy and the potential introduction of a skills and growth levy. However, Realise’s
proactive approach to revenue diversification has significantly mitigated this risk. By expanding its focus beyond
apprenticeships to encompass adult education and bootcamps, Realise has diversified its revenue streams,
reducing its dependency on government-funded initiatives. While the evolving political landscape remains a
factor to monitor closely, Realise’s strategic diversification efforts serve as a robust buffer against potential policy
shifts.

mm

Price Risk

The Company is exposed to price risk as a result of its operations. The board closely monitors changes to prices
across apprenticeship and adult education markets and reacts appropriately to such changes on a timely basis.
he company has no contro! over the maximum prices that it charges for apprenticeships, as these are capped
by the Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education. Although, we have seen some material orice
increases on our core apprenticeship standards and functional skills in 2023 which will be effective in 2024.

4

Economic Risk

The Company generates the majority of its turnover from training employer’s workforces using apprenticeships
Ihis relies On employers’ upskilling their worktorce and hiring new employees as apprentices. |he economic
situation may impact the number of organisations employing apprentices. As detailed in price risk, the company
has exposure ta wage inflation as the company has no control over the maximum prices it charges for a majority
of its products. Due to the industries Realise operates in, the company has significant exposure to economic
tisk.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

The company has exposure to a variety of financial risks which are managed with the purpose of minimising
any potential adverse effect on the company’s performance. The Board has policies for managing each of these
risks.

The company currently receives the majority of its revenue from government sources and is not therefore
exposed to significant credit risk. Additionally, the company considers that it is not subject to any interest rate or
currency risk

To mitigate liquidity risk the company prepares regular cash flow budgets and operational budgets which are

reviewed by the Board. The company has access to financing facilities to satisfy working capital requirements
if needed.

the company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the
company and enable them to ensure that the financial staternents comply with the Companies Act 2006. They

the year then ended:
* have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice;

« have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2008.

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable
law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the “Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit
of the financial statements” section of our report. We are independent of the company in accordance with the
ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained Is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
opinion.

Conclusions relating to going concern

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of
accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or
conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a
going concem for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for
issue.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the
relevant sections of this report

Other information

The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial
statements and our auditor’s report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained
within the annual report. Our apinion on the financial statements does not cover the other inforrnation and,
except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance
conclusion thereon.

Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is
materially inconsistent with the financial staternents or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material
misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial
statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material
misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact

We have nothing to report in this regard

Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit

e the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which the

e the strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal
requirements.

Matters on which we are required to report by exception

In light of the knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the course of the
audit, we have not identified material misstaternents in the strategic report or the directors’ report.

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006

requires us to report to you If, in our opinion:

* adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received
from branches not visited by us; or

« the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and retums; or

e certain disclosures of directors’ rernuneration specified by law are not made, or

*® we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

Responsibilities of Directors

As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 6, the directors are responsible
for the preparation of the financial staternents and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for
such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the company’s ability to
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going
concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the company or to cease operations,
or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free
rom material misstaternent, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstaternents can arise
rom fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.

The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below.

regularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures
in fine with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities,
including fraud.

Based on our understanding of the company and its industry, we considered that non-compliance with the
ollowing laws and regulations might have a material effect on the financial statements: Office for Standards in
Education (Ofsted) regulation, Education and Skills Funding Agency regulation, employment regulation, health
and safety regulation, anti-money laundering regulation, data protection regulation and the Bribery Act 2010.

PAGE 9

Realise Learning and Employment Limited (Registered number: 07703720)
Independent Auditor's Report to the Members of Realise Learning and Employment Limited

To help us identify instances of non-compliance with these laws and regulations, and in identifying and
assessing the risks of material misstatement in respect to non-compliance, our procedures included, but were
not limited to.

e inquiring of management and, where appropriate, those charged with governance, as to whether the
company is in compliance with laws and regulations, and discussing their policies and procedures regarding
compliance with laws and regulations;

« Inspecting correspondence, if any, with relevant licensing or regulatory authorities;

e Communicating identified laws and regulations to the engagement team and remaining alert to any
indications of non-compliance throughout our audit; and

« Considering the risk of acts by the company which were contrary to applicaole laws and regulations,
including fraud.

We also considered thase laws and regulations that have a direct effect on the preparation of the financial
statements, such as tax legislation, pension legislation, the Companies Act 2006.

In addition, we evaluated the directors’ and management's incentives and opportunities for fraudulent
manipulation of the financial statements, including the risk of management override of controls, and determined
that the principal risks related to posting manual journals entries to manipulate financial performance,
management bias through judgements and assumptions in significant accounting estimates, in particular in
relation to the valuation of ESFA and ESIF income provisions, assessment of impairment indicators in respect of
goodwill, the recoverability of intercompany debtors, valuation of deferred tax assets, revenue recognition (which
we pinpointed to the occurrence of revenue) and significant one-off or unusual transactions.

Our audit procedures in relation to fraud included but were not limited to:

® Making enquiries of the directors and management on whether they had knowledge of any actual,
suspected or alleged fraud;
Gaining an understanding of the internal controls established to mitigate risks related to fraud;
Discussing amongst the engagement team the risks of fraud; and

* Addressing the risks of fraud through management override of controls by performing journal entry testing.

There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above and the primary responsibility for the
prevention and detection of irregularities including fraud rests with management. As with any audit, there
remained a risk of non-detection of irregularities, as these may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,
misrepresentations or the override of internal controls

Reporting Councils website at www fre org uk/auditorsresponsibllities. This description forms part of our
auditor's report

Use of the audit report

This report is made solely to the company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members
those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest
extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the

Turnover

Turnover comprises revenue for training services supplied and is exclusive of any VAT. It is recognised
by the company when receivable in respect of new learner recruitment, training delivered or achievement
of qualifications. Revenue and related profit are only recognised when it has been delivered in accordance
with a contract and, if dependent on a successful outcome for the learner, recognised only on
achievement. The funding contracts have a number of performance and documentation criteria attached
to them. Revenue is recognised to the extent that management consider the relevant criteria to be used
for assessment have been met. Where uncertainty exists, income is deferred and included within other
provisions until the outcome of contract reviews is finalised.

Intangible fixed assets
Intangible assets are initially recognised at cost. After recognition, under the cost model, intangible assets
are measured at cost less any accumulated amortisation and impairment losses

Intangible assets consist of computer software and are amortised on a straight line basis over 3 - 5
years. Amortisation is charged to administrative expenses within the Staternent of Comprehensive
Income.

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the difference between amounts paid on the cost of a business combination and
the acquirer's interest in the fair value of the Company’s share of its identifiable assets and liabilities of
the acquiree at the date of acquisition. Subsequent to initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less
accumulated amortisation and accumulated imoairment losses. Goodwill is amortised on a straight-line
basis over a useful life of 10 years to the Statement of Comprehensive Income.

Tangible fixed assets

Tangible fixed assets under the cost model are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation
Deprevialion is provided al rales calculated to write off the cost of fixed assets less thei estimated
residual value over their expected useful lives on the following bases:

Fixtures and fittings - straight line over 3-4 years
Computer equipment - straight line over 3 years
Leasehold improvements - straight line over 4 years
Motor vehicies - straight line over 4 years

Depreciation is charged to administrative expenses within the Statement of Comprehensive Income.

Provision for liabilities

Provisions are recognised when the company has a present obligation as a result of a past event, it is
probable that the company will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made
of the amount of the obligation.

Provision is made to repay initial funding provided by the customer, where learners do not meet minimum
contractual learning periods.

Performance and obligations against customer and supplier contracts are reviewed on a regular basis.
Where necessary, provisions are made against these contracts These provisions require managements’
best estimate of the financial implications at the date of these accounts.

Debtors

Short term debtors are measured at transaction price, iess any impairment. Loans receivable are
measured initially at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are measured subsequently at amortised
cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued

Creditors

Short term creditors are measured at the transaction price. Other financial liabilities, including bank loans,
are measured initially at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are measured subsequently at amortised
cost using the effective interest method.

Taxation

The tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Statement of
Comprehensive Income, except that a charge attributable to an item of income and expense recognised
as other comprehensive income or to an item recognised directly in equity is also recognised in other
income or directly in equity respectively.

Current taxes are based on the results shown in the financial statements and are calculated according
to local tax rules, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted by the Statement of Financial Position
date

Deferred tax balances are recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not
reversed by the Statement of Financial Position date, except that:
« The recognition of deferred tax assets is limited to the extent that it is probable that they will be
recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits; and
« Any deferred tax balances are reversed if and when all conditions for retaining associated tax
allowances have been met.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are caiculated at the tax rates expected to be effective at the time of
the expected reversal of the timing differences

Hire purchase and leasing commitments

Rentals under operating leases are charged on a straight line basis over the lease terms Benefits received
and receivable as an incentive to sign an operating lease are recognised on a straight line basis over the
period until the date the rent is expected to be adjusted to the prevailing market rate.

Dilapidation provision
Provision is made for contractual property dilapidation obligations during the period of occupation of each
premise.

Employee benefit costs

The company operates a defined contribution pension scheme. Contributions payable to the company's
pension scheme are charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period to which they
relate.

Exceptional terns
Exceptional items are transactions that fall within the ordinary activities of the cornpany but are presented
separately due to their size or incidence.

Judgements and key areas of estimation uncertainty

The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities at the Staternent of Financial
Position date and the amounts reported for income and expenses during the period. However, the nature
of estimation means that actual outcomes could differ from those estimates

Revenue recognition

Revenue is recognised reflecting learners on programme at the end of each accounting period. Where
learner attrition occurs prior to the period end, historic trends are used as a basis for estimating potential
revenue reduction which is accounted for as a provision.

Judgements and key areas of estimation uncertainty continued

Impairment of goodwill

Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estirnation of the value in use of the cash-
generating units to which goodwill has been allocated. The value in use calculation requires the entity to
estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount
rate in order to calculate the present value. The Directors’ remain confident that the value of the goodwill
is not impaired based on the expected future performance of the acquisitions. The carrying amount of
goodwill at the balance sheet date was £996,745 (see Note 10). No impairment has been made.

Deferred tax assets

The Company has recognised a material deferred tax asset which primarily originates from the future
expected offset of historic taxable losses against taxable profits. Judgement is required in determining
whether it is probable that sufficient future taxable profits will arise to support the recognition of the
deferred tax asset. This judgement is based on the long term financial projections of the Company.

The carrying of deferred tax assets at the balance sheet date was £1,489,193 (see Note 18)

TURNOVER
The whole of the turnover is attrioutable to the provision of services within the education and training
sector.

All turnover arose within the United Kingdom.

The UK Government announced in the 2021 budget that from 1 April 2023, the rate of corporation tax in
the United Kingdom will increase from 19% to 25%. Companies with profit of £50,000 or less will continue
to be taxed at 19%, which is a new small profits rate. Where taxable profits are between £50,000 and
£250,000, the higher rate 25% will apply out with a marginal relief applying as profits increase.

As at 31 December 2023 the company had carried forward tax losses of £5,693,513 (2022: £6,375,951)
