STATUTORY INFORMATION

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of preparing the financial statements

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102 "The
Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland" including the provisions of Section 1A
"Small Entities" and the Companies Act 2006. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical
cost convention.

Turnover
Turnover is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, excluding discounts, rebates,
value added tax and other sales taxes.

Goodwill
Goodwill, being the amount paid in connection with the acquisition of a business in 2020, is being amortised
evenly over its estimated useful life of five years.

Intangible assets
Intangible assets are initially measured at cost. After initial recognition, intangible assets are measured at cost
less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.

Tangible fixed assets

Depreciation is provided at the following annual rates in order to write off each asset over its estimated useful

life.

Plant and machinery etc - 33% on reducing balance, 25% on reducing balance and 15% on reducing
balance

Stocks

Stocks are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value, after making due allowance for obsolete and slow
moving items.

Taxation

Taxation for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Income Statement, except to
the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.

Current or deferred taxation assets and liabilities are not discounted.

Current tax is recognised at the amount of tax payable using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued

Deferred tax

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance
sheet date.

Timing differences arise from the inclusion of income and expenses in tax assessments in periods different from
those in which they are recognised in financial statements. Deferred tax is measured using tax rates and laws
that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the year end and that are expected to apply to the reversal
of the timing difference.

Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that they
will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.

Hire purchase and leasing commitments

Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to profit or loss on a straight line basis over the period of the
lease,

Pension costs and other post-retirement benefits

The company operates a defined contribution pension scheme. Contributions payable to the company's pension
scheme are charged to profit or loss in the period to which they relate.

EMPLOYEES AND DIRECTORS
