Strategic Report
for the Year Ended 30th November 2023

The directors present their strategic report for the year ended 30th November 2023.

REVIEW OF BUSINESS
The results for the year and financial position at the year end are shown in these financial
statements.

There has been strong growth in the business in the 2023 financial year, due to new contracts won.
Turnover increased by 56% to £31.0m (2022: £19.8m). Operating profit was £7.8m (2022: £4.7m)
and administrative expenses increased to £1.8m (2022: £1.4m) as a result of increased trading.
We look forward to the year ahead, with management expecting to be supported by positive market
drivers to build the business and extend our market leading position.

During 2023 the company continued to note the education policy and funding commitments made
by the government, which underpin the company's view of an ongoing favourable landscape for
demand for its services from individuals working in education in England.

KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS

The company and directors benefit from a well-developed operating system, which provides a
number of relevant key performance reports. The key performance indicator of trainee sign ups
(the number of trainees signed up to training courses facilitated by the company) is available to the
directors in real time and compared to prior years and budget. This can be analysed allowing
management to respond to changes in business levels by redirecting resources. Further indicators
are also prepared including cash reports, monthly management accounts and a variety of HR
indicators, including staff turnover. The number of trainee sign ups in the year to 30th November
2023 was higher than budgeted due to new contracts won during the course of the year.

Strategic Report
for the Year Ended 30th November 2023

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES

The management of the business is subject to a number of risks. Risks are reviewed by
management and appropriate processes put in place to monitor and mitigate them. The key
business risks for the company are described in more detail below:

Liquidity risk

The company seeks to manage financial risk by ensuring sufficient liquidity is available to meet
foreseeable needs. The company is supported by it's parent company, Hood Topco Limited, to
ensure continuity of funding.

Credit risk
As the majority of the company’s customers are Local Authorities or education settings funded by
the government, the company’s credit risk is considered to be low.

Reputation risk

The company operates in a specialist training and development market and competes with a large
number of organisations, many of whom are small school-based providers supplying the schools
within their focal area or school group. Damage to the reputation of the company is a key risk and
is regularly reviewed through customer surveys and evaluation of the regular/daily feedback
obtained from all participants on all training courses.

As with any training business, the academic content and quality of delivery of our courses are key
to the success of the business. Performance in this area is monitored by a comprehensive set of
KPls which has been set by the Directors and by Government funding agencies. The satisfaction
ratings from the participant feedback are reviewed in detail at monthly Board meetings, as are
quality control reports from experienced internal quality control personnel and independent
agencies operaliig under the direction of the Department for Education and other Government
funding agencies. The Directors respond, if necessary, to ensure that quality and performance
continues to exceed the KPIs.

The company operates under strict guidelines with regards to the personnel who deliver the
training and assessments. Vetting and recruitment checks are carried out prior to appointing any
individual to our panel of approved training facilitators and assessors. The Directors have set in
place controls to monitor closely the need for any alterations to the company's processes and
procedures. Whilst changes in legislation and the environment are risks faced, the Directors
believe that the investment in the company’s operating systems as well as the responsive nature of
the management team enable any changes to be understood and used to further benefit the
company by actively responding to the changes to support our clients and ease the additional
burdens placed upon them.

Strategic Report
for the Year Ended 30th November 2023

GOING CONCERN
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which the Directors
consider to be appropriate for the following reasons.

The Company is part of the Hood Topco Limited group (the "Group"). The Company has net assets
of £15.9 million (2022: £10.0 million), net current assets of £15.6 million (2022: £9.6 million) and
made a profit for the year amounting to £5.9 million (2022: £3.7 million).

The company's cash flow forecasts indicate that the company will have sufficient resources to meet
its liabilities as they fall due over the period up to 30th June 2025. However, the Company's ability
to continue to operate as a going concern is directly linked to the Group position as all of the
subsidiaries, including the company, share the same financing facilities as the Group and the
Company is joint guarantor of the loans acquired by the Group.

The Board of the Group undertook an assessment of the ability of the Group to continue in
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over a period up to 30 June 2025. The Group's
assessment was made available to the Directors of the Company. The Directors did not consider
that this assessment indicated the existence of a material uncertainty which may cast significant
doubt about the Group's ability to continue as a going concern.

The Group have provided the Company with an undertaking that for at least 12 months from the
date of approval of these financial statements, it will continue to make available such funds as are
needed by the Company and will not seek repayment of the amounts currently made available.
This should enable the Company to continue in operational existence for the 12 months from the
date of signing these financial statements by meeting its liabilities as they fall due for payment.

As with any company placing rellance on other group entities for financial support, the Directors
acknowledge that there can be no certainty that this support will continue although, at the date of
approval of these financial statements, they have no reason to believe that it will not do so.

Consequently, the directars are confident that the company will have sufficient funds to continue to
meet its liabilities as they fall due for at least twelve months from the date of approval of the
financial statements and therefore have prepared the financial statements on a going concern
basis.

Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under

standards and applicable law (UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice), including FRS 102
The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland.

Page 5

Best Practice Network Limited

Directors’ Report
for the Year Ended 30th November 2023

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS' RESPONSIBILITIES - continued

Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of the profit or
loss of the company for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the directors are
required to:

- select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently:
- make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;

- state whether applicable UK accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material
departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements;

- assess the company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters
related to going concern; and

- use the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the company or
to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show
and explain the company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the
financial position of the company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply
with the Companies Act 2006. They are responsible for such internal control as they determine is
necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and have general responsibility for taking such steps
as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the company and to prevent and detect
fraud and other irregularities.

STATEMENT AS TO DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO AUDITORS

So far as the directors are aware, there is no relevant audit information (as defined by Section 418
of the Companies Act 2006) of which the company's auditor is unaware, and each director has
taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a director in order to make himself aware of any
relevant audit information and to establish that the company's auditor is aware of that information.

AUDITOR
Pursuant to Section 487 of the Companies Act 2006, the auditor will be deemed to be reappointed
and KPMG LLP will therefore continue in office.

BY ORDER OF THE BOARD:

Douglas Glenday - Director

Independent Auditor's Report to the Members of
Best Practice Network Limited

Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of Best Practice Network Limited ("the Company") for the
year ended 30 November 2023 which comprise the Statement of Comprehensive Income, Balance
Sheet, Statement of Changes in Equity and related notes, including the accounting policies in note
2.

In our opinion the financial statements:

- give a true and fair view of the state of the Company's affairs as at 30 November 2023 and of its
profit for the year then ended;

- have been properly prepared in accordance with UK accounting standards, including FRS 102
The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland; and

~ have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) ("ISAs (UK)")
and applicabie law. Our responsibilities are described below. We have fulfilled our ethical
responsibilities under, and are independent of the Company in accordance with, UK ethical
requirements including the FRC Ethical Standard. We believe that the audit evidence we have
obtained is a sufficient and appropriate basis for our opinion.

Going concern

The directors have prepared the financial statements on the going concern basis as they do not
intend to liquidate the Company or to cease its operations, and as they have concluded that the
Company's financial position means that this is realistic. They have also concluded that there are
no material uncertainties that could have cast significant doubt over its ability to continue as a
going concern for at least a year from the date of approval of the financial statements ("the going
concern period").

In our evaluation of the directors’ conclusions, we considered the inherent risks to the Company's
business model and analysed how those risks might affect the Company's financial resources or
ability to continue operations over the going concern period.

Our conclusions based on this work:

- we consider that the directors’ use of the going concem basis of accounting in the preparation of
the financial statements is appropriate;

- we have not identified, and concur with the directors’ assessment that there is not, a material
uncertainty related to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant
doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for the going concern period.

However, as we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result
in outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were
made, the above conclusions are not a guarantee that the Company will continue in operation.

Fraud and breaches of laws and regulations - ability to detect
Identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement due to fraud

To identify risks of material misstatement due to fraud ("fraud risks") we assessed events or
conditions that could indicate an incentive or pressure to commit fraud or provide an opportunity to
commit fraud. Our risk assessment procedures included:

- Enquiring of directors as to the Company's high-level policies and procedures to prevent and
detect fraud, as well as whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud.

- Reading Board meeting minutes.

- Considering remuneration incentive schemes and performance targets for management and
directors.

- Using analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships.

Page 7

Independent Auditor's Report to the Members of
Best Practice Network Limited

We communicated identified fraud risks throughout the audit team and remained alert to any
indications of fraud throughout the audit.

As required by auditing standards and taking in to account possible pressure to meet sales targets,
we perform procedures to address the risk of management override of controls, in particular the
risk that management may be in a position to make inappropriate accounting entries. On this audit
we do not believe there is a fraud risk related to revenue recognition due to small size of individual
revenue transactions, in order for revenue to be materially misstated large number of individual
revenue transactions would have to be affected.

We did not identify any additional fraud risks.
We performed procedures including:

- Identifying journal entries to test based on risk criteria and comparing the identified entries to
supporting documentation. These included revenue and cash journal entries posted to unexpected
accounts and journal entries posted to seldom used accounts.

Identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement related to compliance with
laws and regulations

We identified areas of laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a material
effect on the financial statements from our general commercial and sector experience and through
discussion with the directors and other management (as required by auditing standards), and
discussed with the directors and other management the policies and procedures regarding
compliance with laws and regulations.

We communicated identified laws and regulations throughout our team and remained alert to any
indications of non-compliance througlivul lhe audil.

The potential effect of these laws and regulations on the financial statements varies considerably.

Firstly, the Company is subject to laws and regulations that directly affect the financial statements
including financial reporting legislation (including related companies legislation), distributable profits
legislation and taxation legislation and we assessed the extent of compliance with these laws and
regulations as part of our procedures on the related financial statement items.

Secondly, the Company is subject to many other laws and regulations where the consequences of
non-compliance could have a material effect on amounts or disclosures in the financial statements,
for instance through the imposition of fines or litigation. We identified the following areas as those
most likely to have such an effect: health and safety, data protection laws, anti-bribery, employment
law, tax laws and environment legislation, recognising the nature of the Company's activities.
Auditing standards limit the required audit procedures to identify non-compliance with these laws
and regulations to enquiry of the directors and other management and inspection of regulatory and
legal correspondence, if any. Therefore if a breach of operational regulations is not disclosed to us
or evident from relevant correspondence, an audit will not detect that breach.

Context of the ability of the audit to detect fraud or breaches of law or regulation

Owing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk that we may not have
detected some material misstatements in the financial statements, even though we have properly
planned and performed our audit in accordance with auditing standards. For example, the further
removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in
the financial statements, the less likely the inherently limited procedures required by auditing
standards would identify it.

Page 8

Independent Auditor's Report to the Members of
Best Practice Network Limited

In addilion, as with any audit, there remained a higher risk of non-detection of fraud, as fraud may
involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal
controls. Our audit procedures are designed to detect material misstatement. We are not
responsible for preventing non-compliance or fraud and cannot be expected to detect
non-compliance with all laws and regulations.

Strategic report and directors’ report
The directors are responsible for the strategic report and the directors’ report. Our opinion on the
financial statements does not cover those reports and we do not express an audit opinion thereon.

Our responsibility is to read the strategic report and the directors' report and, in doing so, consider
whether, based on our financial statements audit work, the information therein is materially
misstated or inconsistent with the financial statements or our audit knowledge. Based solely on
that work:

- we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report and the directors’ report;

- in our opinion the information given in those reports for the financial year is consistent with the
financial statements; and

- in our opinion those reports have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.

Matters on which we are required to report by exception

Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:

- adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been
received from branches not visited by us; or

- the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or

- certain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or

- we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

We have nothing to report in these respects.

Directors‘ responsibilities

As explained more fully in their statement set out on page 6, the directors are responsible for: the
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view;
such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; assessing the
Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to
going concern; and using the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to
liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditor's responsibilities

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a
whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue our opinion
in an auditor's report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but does not guarantee
that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if,
individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic
decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.

A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC'’s website at
www. frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.

The purpose of our audit work and to whom we owe our responsibilities

This report is made solely to the Company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of
Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to
the Company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and
for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company's members, as a body, for our
audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Notes to the Financial Statements

STATUTORY INFORMATION

Best Practice Network Limited is a private company, limited by shares, registered in England
and Wales. The company's registered number and registered office address can be found on
the Company Information page.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of preparing the financial statements

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting
Standard 102 "The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of
Ireland" and the Companies Act 2006. The financial statements have been prepared under
the historical cost convention.

The presentation currency of these financial statements is sterling. All amounts in the
financial statements have been rounded to the nearest £1,000.

Going Concern
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which the Directors
consider to be appropriate for the following reasons.

The Company is part of the Hood Topco Limited group (the "Group"). The Company has net
assets of £15.9 million (2022: £10.0 million), net current assets of £15.6 million (2022: £9.6
million) and made a profit for the year amounting to £5.9 million (2022: £3.7 million).

The company's cash flow forecasts indicate that the company will have sufficient resources
to meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period up to 30th June 2025. However, the
Company's ability to continue to operate as a going concern is directly linked to the Group
position as ail of the subsidiaries including the company share the same financing facilities
as the Group and the Company is joint guarantor of the loans acquired by the Group.

The Board of the Group undertook an assessment of the ability of the Group to continue in
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over a period up to 30 June 2025. The
Group's assessment was made available to the Directors of the Company. The Directors did
not consider that this assessment indicated the existence of a material uncertainty which
may cast significant doubt about the Group's ability to continue as a going concern.

The Group have provided the Company with an undertaking that for at east 12 months from
the date of approval of these financial statements, it will continue to make available such
funds as are needed by the Company and will not seek repayment of the arnmounts currently
made available. This should enable the Company to continue in operational existence for the
12 months from the date of signing these financial statements by meeting its liabilities as
they fall due for payment.

As with any company placing reliance on other group entities for financial support, the
Directors acknowledge that there can be no certainty that this support will continue although,
at the date of approval of these financial statements, they have no reason to believe that it
will not do so.

Consequently, the directors are confident that the company will have sufficient funds to
continue to meet its liabilities as they fall due for at least twelve months from the date of
approval of the financial statements and therefore have prepared the financial statements on
a going concern basis.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued

Financial Reporting Standard 102 - reduced disclosure exemptions

The company has taken advantage of the following disclosure exemptions in preparing these
financial statements, as permitted by FRS 102 “The Financial Reporting Standard applicable
in the UK and Republic of Ireland”:

+ the requirements of Section 7 Statement of Cash Flows;

+ the requirements of paragraphs 11.42, 11.44, 11.45, 11.47, 11.48(a)(iii), 11.48(a)(iv),
11.48(b) and 11.48(c);

* the requirements of paragraphs 12.26, 12.27, 12.29(a), 12.29(b) and 12.29A;

* the requirements of paragraphs 26.18(b), 26.19 to 26.21 and 26.23;

* the requirement of paragraph 33.7.

Related party exemption

The company has taken advantage of exemption, under the terms of Financial Reporting
Standard 102 ‘The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of
Ireland’, not to disclose related party transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries within the
group.

Significant judgements and estimates

There are no judgments made by the directors, in the application of these accounting policies
that have significant effect on the financial statements and estimates with a significant risk of
material adjustment in the next year.

Turnover
Turnover is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, excluding
discounts, rebates, value added tax and other sales taxes.

When the outcome of a transaction involving the rendering of services can be estimated
reliably, turnover associated with the transaction is recognised by reference to the stage of
completion of the transaction at the end of the reporting period. Where services are
performed by an indeterminate number of acts over a specified period of time, turnover is
recognised on a straight-line basis over the specified period.

Tumover is typically recognised by reference to the proportion of a training course
completed.

Intangible assets

Intangible assets are initially measured at cost. After initial recognition, intangible assets are
measured at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment
losses.

Patenis and licences are being amortised evenly over their estimated useful life of three
years.

Development costs are being amortised evenly over their estimated useful life of two years.

Computer software is being amortised evenly over its estimated useful life of four years.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued

Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated
impairment losses.

Depreciation is charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives of each part of an item of tangible fixed assets. The estimated useful
lives are as follows:

Fixtures and fittings 4 years
Equipment 4 years

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed if there is an indication
of a significant change since last annual reporting date in the pattern by which the company
expects to consume an asset's future economic benefits.

Basic financial instruments

Trade and cther debtors / creditors

Trade and other debtors are recognised initially at transaction price less attributable
transaction costs. Trade and other creditors are recognised initially at transaction price plus
attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at
amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses in the case of
trade debtors. If the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, for example if payment
is deferred beyond normal business terms, then it is measured at the present value of future
payments discounted at a market rate of interest for a similar debt instrument.

Interest-bearing borrowings classified as basic financial instruments

interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at the present value of future payments
discounted at a market rate of interest. Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing
borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any
impairment losses.

Taxation

Taxation for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Statement
of Comprehensive Income, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in
equity or other comprehensive income, in which case it is recognised directly in equity or
other comprehensive income.

Current or deferred taxation assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Current tax is recognised at the amount of tax payable using the tax rates and laws that have

been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax
payable in respect of previous years.

Deferred tax

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not
reversed at the balance sheet date.

Timing differences arise from the inclusion of income and expenses in tax assessments in
periods different from those in which they are recognised in financial statements. The
following timing differences are not provided for: differences between accumulated
depreciation and tax allowances for the cost of a fixed asset if and when ali conditions for
retaining the tax allowances have been met; and differences relating to investments in
subsidiaries, to the extent that it is not probable that they will reverse in the foreseeable
future and the reporting entity is able to control the reversal of the timing difference.
Deferred tax is not recognised on permanent differences arising because certain types of
income or expense are non-taxable or are disallowable for tax or because certain tax
charges or allowances are greater or smailer than the corresponding income or expense.

Deferred tax is measured using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the year end and that are expected to apply to the reversal of the timing
difference.

Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it
is probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other
future taxable profits.

Pension costs and other post-retirement benefits

The campany operates a defined contribution pension scheme. The assets of the scheme
are held separately from those of the Company in an independently administered fund.
Contributions payable to the company's pension scheme are charged to profit or loss in the
period to which they relate.

Impairment excluding deferred tax assets

Financial assets (including trade and other debtors)

A financial asset not carried at fair value through profit or loss is assessed at each reporting
date to determine whether there is objective evidence that it is impaired. A financial asset is
impaired if objective evidence indicates that a loss event has occurred after the initial
recognition of the asset, and that the loss event had a negative effect on the estimated future
cash flows of that asset that can be estimated reliably.

An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated
as the difference between its carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future
cash flows discounted at the asset's original effective interest rate. For financial instruments
measured at cost less impairment an impairment is calculated as the difference between its
carrying amount and the best estimate of the amount that the company would receive for the
asset if it were to be sold at the reporting date. Interest on the impaired asset continues to be
recognised through the unwinding of the discount. Impairment losses are recognised in profit
or loss. When a subsequent event causes the amount of impairment loss to decrease, the
decrease in impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss.

Impairment excluding deferred tax assets - continued

Non-financial assets

The carrying amounts of the company’s non-financial assets, other than deferred tax assets,
are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of
impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset's recoverable amount is estimated.
The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use
and its fair value less costs to sell.

An impairment loss recognised on goodwill is not reversed. An impairment loss recognised
for other assets is reversed if and only if the reasons for the impairment have ceased to

apply.

Impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any
indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed
only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that
would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had
been recognised.

Provisions

A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the company has a present legal or
constructive obligation as a result of a past event, that can be reliably measured and it is
probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Provisions are recognised at the best estimate of the amount required to settle the obligation
at the reporting date.

Where the company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness
of other companies within its group, the company treats the guarantee contract as a
contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the company will be required
to make a payment under the guarantee.

Operating lease

Payments (excluding costs for services and insurance) made under operating leases are
recognised in the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease
unless the payments to the lessor are structured to increase in line with expected general
inflation; in which case the payments related to the structured increases are recognised as
incurred. Lease incentives received are recognised in profit and loss over the term of the
lease as an integral part of the total lease expense.

Interest receivable and Interest payable

Interest payable and similar charges include interest payable, finance charges on shares
classified as liabilities and finance leases recognised in profit or loss using the effective
interest method, unwinding of the discount on provisions, and net foreign exchange losses
that are recognised in the profit and joss account (see foreign currency accounting policy).

Other interest receivable and similar income include interest receivable on funds invested
and net foreign exchange gains.

Interest income and interest payable are recognised in profit or loss as they accrue, using
the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognised in the profit and loss account on
the date the company's right to receive payments is established. Foreign currency gains and
losses are reported on a net basis.

TAXATION - continued

In the Spring Budget 2021, the UK Government announced that from 1st April 2023 the
corporation tax rate would increase to 25% (rather than remaining at 19%, as previously
enacted). This new law was substantively enacted on 24th May 2021. For the financial year
ended 30th November 2023, the weighted averaged tax rate was 23.01%.

Deferred taxes at the balance sheet date have been measured using these enacted tax rates
and reflected in these financial statements.
