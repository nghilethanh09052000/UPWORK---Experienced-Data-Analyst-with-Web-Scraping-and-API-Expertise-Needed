Year ended 31 July 2024

General information

The company is a private company limited by shares, registered in England and Wales. The
address of the registered office is The Old Guild House, New Market Street, Birmingham, B3
2NH, England.

Statement of compliance

These abridged financial statements have been prepared in compliance with Section 1A of FRS
102, ‘The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and the Republic of freland’.

Accounting policies
Basis of preparation

The abridged financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, as modified
by the revaluation of certain financial assets and liabilities and investment properties measured at
fair value through profit or loss.

The abridged financial statements are prepared in sterling, which is the functional currency of the
entity.

Disclosure exemptions

The entity satisfies the criteria of being a qualifying entity as defined in FRS 102. As such,
advantage has been taken of the following disclosure exemptions available under paragraph 1.12
of FRS 102:

(a) Disclosures in respect of each class of share capital have not been presented.

(b) No cash flow statement has been presented for the company.

(c) Disclosures in respect of financial instruments have not been presented.

(d) Disclosures in respect of share-based payments have not been presented.

(e) No disclosure has been given for the aggregate remuneration of key management personnel.

Consolidation

The company has taken advantage of the option not to prepare consolidated abridged financial
statements contained in Section 398 of the Companies Act 2006 on the basis that the company
and its subsidiary undertakings comprise a small group.

Revenue recognition

Turnover is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods
supplied and services rendered, net of discounts and Value Added Tax.

Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of
ownership have transferred to the buyer (usually on despatch of the goods); the amount of
revenue can be measured reliably; it is probable that the associated economic benefits will flow to
the entity; and the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transactions can be measured
reliably.

Income tax

The taxation expense represents the aggregate amount of current and deferred tax recognised in
the reporting period. Tax is recognised in profit or loss, except to the extent that it relates to items
recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, tax is recognised in
other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.

Current tax is recognised on taxable profit for the current and past periods. Current tax is
measured at the amounts of tax expected to pay or recover using the tax rates and laws that
have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences at the reporting date. Unrelieved
tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that they
will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.
Deferred tax is measured using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the reporting date that are expected to apply to the reversal of the timing difference.

Tangible assets

Tangible assets are initially recorded at cost, and subsequently stated at cost less any
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Any tangible assets carried at revalued
amounts are recorded at the fair value at the date of revaluation less any subsequent
accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses.

An increase in the carrying amount of an asset as a result of a revaluation, is recognised in other
comprehensive income and accumulated in equity, except to the extent it reverses a revaluation
decrease of the same asset previously recognised in profit or loss. A decrease in the carrying
amount of an asset as a result of revaluation, is recognised in other comprehensive income to the
extent of any previously recognised revaluation increase accumulated in equity in respect of that
asset. Where a revaluation decrease exceeds the accumulated revaluation gains accumulated in
equity in respect of that asset, the excess shall be recognised in profit or loss.

Depreciation

Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost or valuation of an asset, less its residual
value, over the useful economic life of that asset as follows:

Motor Vehicles - 25% reducing balance
Investments

Fixed asset investments are initially recorded at cost, and subsequently stated at cost less any
accumulated impairment losses.

Listed investments are measured at fair value with changes in fair value being recognised in profit
or loss.

Accounting policies (continued)
Impairment of fixed assets

A review for indicators of impairment is carried out at each reporting date, with the recoverable
amount being estimated where such indicators exist. Where the carrying value exceeds the
recoverable amount, the asset is impaired accordingly. Prior impairments are also reviewed for
possible reversal at each reporting date.

For the purposes of impairment testing, when it is not possible to estimate the recoverable
amount of an individual asset, an estimate is made of the recoverable amount of the cash-
generating unit to which the asset belongs. The cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable
group of assets that includes the asset and generates cash inflows that largely independent of the
cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.

For impairment testing of goodwill, the goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the
acquisition date, allocated to each of the cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from
the synergies of the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the company
are assigned to those units.

Finance leases and hire purchase contracts

Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are recognised in the abridged
statement of financial position as assets and liabilities at the lower of the fair value of the assets
and the present value of the minimum lease payments, which is determined at the inception of
the lease term. Any initial direct costs of the lease are added to the amount recognised as an
asset.

Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the outstanding
lease liability using the effective interest method. Finance charges are allocated to each period so
as to produce a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.

Financial instruments

A financial asset or a financial liability is recognised only when the entity becomes a party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument.

Basic financial instruments are initially recognised at the transaction price, unless the
arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where it is recognised at the present value of the
future payments discounted at a market rate of interest for a similar debt instrument.

Debt instruments are subsequently measured at amortised cost.

Where investments in non-convertible preference shares and non-puttable ordinary shares or
preference shares are publicly traded or their fair value can otherwise be measured reliably, the
investment is subsequently measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in profit
or loss. All other such investments are subsequently measured at cost less impairment.

Other financial instruments, including derivatives, are initially recognised at fair value, unless
payment for an asset is deferred beyond normal business terms or financed at a rate of interest
that is not a market rate, in which case the asset is measured at the present value of the future
payments discounted at a market rate of interest for a similar debt instrument.

Other financial instruments are subsequently measured at fair value, with any changes
recognised in profit or loss, with the exception of hedging instruments in a designated hedging
relationship (see hedge accounting policy).

Financial assets that are measured at cost or amortised cost are reviewed for objective evidence
of impairment at the end of each reporting date. If there is objective evidence of impairment, an
impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss immediately.

For all equity instruments regardless of significance, and other financial assets that are
individually significant, these are assessed individually for impairment. Other financial assets are
either assessed individually or grouped on the basis of similar credit risk characteristics.

Any reversals of impairment are recognised in profit or loss immediately, to the extent that the
reversal does not result in a carrying amount of the financial asset that exceeds what the carrying
amount would have been had the impairment not previously been recognised.

Defined contribution plans

Contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as an expense in the period in which
the related service is provided. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent
that the prepayment will lead to a reduction in future payments or a cash refund.

When contributions are not expected to be settled wholly within 12 months of the end of the
reporting date in which the employees render the related service, the liability is measured on a
discounted present value basis. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as a finance cost in
profit or loss in the period in which it arises.

Employee numbers

The average number of persons employed by the company during the year amounted to 11
(2023: 11).
