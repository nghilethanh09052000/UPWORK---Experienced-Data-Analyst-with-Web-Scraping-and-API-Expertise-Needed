ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of preparing the financial statements

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102 "The
Financial Reporting Standard applicable in UK and Republic of Ireland" and the Companies Act 2006 as
applicable to companies subject to the small companies regime. The disclosure requirements of section 1A of
FRS102 have been applied other than where additional disclosure is required to give a true and fair view.

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.

Turnover

Turnover from the supply of services represents the value of services provided under contracts to the extent that
there is a right to consideration and is recorded at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable.
Where a contract has only been partially completed at the balance sheet date turnover represents the fair value of
the service provided to date based on the stage of completion and the contract activity at the balance sheet date.
Where payments are received from customers in advance of services provided, the amounts are recorded as
deferred income and included as part of creditors due within one year.

Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at purchase cost together with any incidental expenses of acquisition, net of
depreciation and any provision for impairment.

Depreciation is provided on all tangible assets, at rates calculated to write off the cost less estimated residual
value of each asset over its expected useful life as follows:

Fixtures and fittings - 15% on reducing balance and 15% on cost
Motor vehicles - 25% on reducing balance
Office equipment - 33% on cost, 33% on reducing balance, 25% on reducing balance,

25% on cost and 50% on cost
Residual value represents the estimated amount which would currently be obtained from disposal of an asset
after deducting estimated costs of disposal, if the asset were already at an age and in the condition expected at
the end of its estimated useful life.

The gain or loss arising on disposal of an asset is determined on the difference between the sale proceeds and
the carrying value of the asset, and is recognised in the profit and loss account.

Taxation

Current tax, including UK corporation tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax
rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance
sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay
less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date. Timing differences are differences between the
company's taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains
and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the financial
statements.

Leasing Commitments

Rentals under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term, even if the payments are
not made on such basis. Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to sign an operating lease are similarly
spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Pension costs
The company operates a defined contribution pension scheme. Contributions payable to the company's pension
scheme are charged to profit or loss in the period to which they relate.

Employee benefits
The costs of short-term employee benefits are recognised as a liability and an expense.

Where material, the cost of any unused holiday entitlement is recognised in the period in which the employee's
services are received.

Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the company becomes a party to the contractual
provisions of the instrument.

Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual
arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of
the company after deducting all of its liabilities.

All financial assets and liabilities are initially measured at transaction price (including transaction costs), unless
the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction. If an arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, the
financial asset or financial liability is measured at the present value of the future payments discounted at a market
rate of interest for a similar debt instrument.

The following assets and liabilities are classified as basic financial instruments - trade debtors, other debtors, cash
and bank balances, trade creditors, other creditors and bank loans.

Trade debtors, other debtors, cash and bank balances, trade creditors and other creditors are measured at the
amortised cost equivalent to the undiscounted amount of cash or other consideration expected to be paid or
received.

Bank loans are initially measured at the present value of future payments, discounted at a market rate of interest
and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

Impairment of assets
Assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date. If there is objective evidence of
impairment, an impairment loss is recognised in profit and loss as described below.

Non financial assets

An asset is impaired when there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after
initial recognition, the estimated recoverable value of the asset has been reduced. The recoverable amount of an
asset is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.

Financial assets

For financial assets carried at cost less impairment, the impairment loss is the difference between the asset's
carrying amount and the best estimate of the amount that would be received for the asset if it were sold at the
reporting date.

Where indicators exist for a decrease in impairment loss, and the decrease can be related objectively to an event
occurring after the impairment was recognised, the prior impairment loss is tested to determine reversal. An
impairment loss is reversed on an individual impaired financial asset to the extent that the revised recoverable

value does not lead to a revised carrying amount higher than the carrying value had impairment not been
recognised.

EMPLOYEES AND DIRECTORS
The average number of employees during the period was 16 (2024-16).
