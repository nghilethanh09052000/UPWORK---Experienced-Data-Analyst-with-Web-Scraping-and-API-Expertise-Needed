TRUSTEES' REPORT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2024

The Trustees present their annual report together with the audited financial statements of the charitable company for the
year 1 August 2023 to 31 July 2024. The Annual report serves the purposes of both a Trustees’ report and a directors'
report under company law. The Trustees confirm that the Annual report and financial statements of the charitable
company comply with the current statutory requirements, the requirements of the charitable company's governing
document and the provisions of the Statement of Recommended Practice (SORP) applicable to charities preparing their
accounts in accordance with the Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland (FRS102)
(effective 1 January 2019).

Objectives and activities
a. Policies and objectives
Appris Charity is dedicated to consolidating our position as the provider of choice for engineering apprenticeships and
training, predominantly but not exclusively in the West Yorkshire region. Where we can serve and add to our loyal

customer base that we have established over the last 40 years.

These activities deliver public benefit by supporting businesses in recruiting and training young people to gain the skills
required by manufacturing industries which will benefit the local and national economy.

b. Strategies for achieving objectives

To realise our objectives, we have implemented a multi-faceted strategy, including:

1. Community Engagement:
Strengthening partnerships with local businesses, schools, and organisations to extend our outreach.

2.‘ Program Development:

We continuously innovate and refine our educational programs to meet evolving needs.
3. Resource Allocation:

Ensuring optimal use of resources to maximise impact.
4. Enhance Learning Experience

Provide the best possible learning experience for our learners.
c. Activities undertaken to achieve objectives

This year, our key activities include:

1. We are in the process of investing £1m in our training centre resources as a part of our strategy to accommodate
more classroom space and workshop equipment.

2. We have invested substantially in new laptops for learners, where they have the capacity to run the design
softwares required for training purposes.

3. To support our strategic objectives, we continue to increase direct staff with full-time engineering tutors and full-

time engineering advisor positions.

TRUSTEES’ REPORT (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2024

Strategic report

a. Main achievements of the charitable company

We are proud to report significant achievements such as:

Significant increase in footfall in the training centre.
Significant increase in apprentice recruitment

Increase in training centre success rates.

Increase in learners advancing to HNC.

Positive financial results to allow investment in the future.

WPwnr

b. Key performance indicators

In‘November/December 2023 we were Ofsted inspected. The outcome of this inspection was published in January 2024,
where the overall Ofsted Grade 2 = Good Provider, with Grade 2 Good Provider in each subcategory. Under the current
Ofsted inspection rules, we will be Ofsted inspected again before January 2029.

Our performance is measured through a range of indicators, such as:

We recruited 176 apprentices (2023: 146)

We had 93 completions (2023: 79)

Funded value of recruited apprentices 2023/2024 £1.04m (2022/2023: £0.76m)
Gross income was £3.34m (2023: £2.78m)

Net profit £220k (2023: £207k)

wPwNe

c. Factors relevant to achieve objectives

Several external factors pose challenges and opportunities, including:

1. With 83% of our income emanating from our Contract with the DfE, we are exposed to any changes in government
policy, which can be positive or negative.

N

We are inspected by Ofsted, where our contract is subject to achieving and maintaining a satisfactory grade.

»

We continue to win business from local colleges as well as from a local training provider that ceased to deliver
apprenticeships. However, we continue to implement operational improvements to ensure we retain this business.
One of these improvement actions agreed in 2023/24 that will commence its implementation in 2024/25 is a new
business management software system called EOS.

TRUSTEES’ REPORT (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2024

Strategic report (continued)

Financial review
a. Going concern

The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis with total income again exceeding the
expenditure incurred in the year.

The unrestricted funds being carried forwards are in surplus of £3,049,824 as at 31 July 2024 allowing for long term
planning to further support the achievement of the group’s objectives.

The Trustees have therefore concluded that it is appropriate to continue to use the going concern basis in the preparation

of these financial statements. They do not believe there are any material uncertainties in relation to the going concern
assessment.

b. Financial review and future developments

The surplus for the group for the year was £220,444 (2023: £207,509). Total funds at the balance sheet date amount to
£3,231,431 (2023: £3,010,987) and will be applied for future development and in furtherance of the charity’s objectives
for the coming year.

c. Principal risks and uncertainties

We identify and monitor risks and keep a register, which we review on a regular basis.
Our main risks are:

DfE Compliance
We must ensure we comply with the terms of our DfE contract or risk losing it.

OFSTED
A Grade 4 would result in the loss of our Of€ contract.

Staff
We need to recruit and retain competent staff to deliver our programs.

Technology
\n order to maintain our position as the provider of choice, we must keep up to date with new technology developments.

Health & Safety
Failure to comply with legislation could be a serious risk to the business.

TRUSTEES' REPORT (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2024

d. Financial risk management objectives and policies

Our financial risk management strategy includes:

Diversification of Funding Sources:

In addition to our DfE contract, we deliver a range of training courses and consultancy, and we also receive rent from an
investment property. However, that said, our charitable status is based on the delivery of engineering apprenticeships to
the local engineering manufacturing industry, where this remains the focus for our future strategy. Therefore, the DfE

income will continue to be the single largest source of income.

Budgetary Controls:
We prepare a detailed financial budget for income and expenditure, which we review regularly.

Reserve Policy:
We maintain a reserve of liquid funds for unforeseen financial needs. -

e. Principal funding

The charity's primary funding sources this year were:

1. Apprentice Funding: We receive monthly funding known as on-program payments based on the value of the
program being delivered. :

2. Grants: We receive grant funding in respect of 16-18-Year-old apprentice starts.

3. Completion Payments: We receive a completion payment in respect of each completed apprenticeship.

Structure, governance and management
a. Constitution

Appris Charity Limited is a company limited by guarantee. It was incorporated as a private limited company on 18 April
1983 as company number 01716035 and is governed by its Memorandum and Articles of Association.

The directors of the company are also trustees of the charity and accordingly the Directors’ Report incorporates the
Trustees’ Report.

The company is also a registered charity, number 514138 and registered with the Charity Commission on 12 August 1983.
Charity Office: B.T.A.L. House, Laisterdyke, Bradford, West Yorkshire, BD4 8AT.
b. Methods of appointment or election of Trustees

The Chairman is elected by the trustees. Trustees are appointed in accordance with the company’s Articles of Association.
The number of Trustees shall not be less than three but should not be subject to any maximum.

TRUSTEES' REPORT (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2024

Structure, governance and management (continued)

c. Policies adopted for the induction and training of Trustees

New trustees are briefed by the Chairman on their legal obligations under charity law. There is no specific training regime
for the trustees to equip them for their role, though they are required to be competent persons who normally are already
directors of a company in membership.

d. Risk management

The trustees actively review the major risks which the charity faces on a regular basis and consider that maintaining free
reserves at the level stated, combined with continuous review of the controls over key financial systems, will provide
sufficient resources in the event of adverse conditions. The trustees have also examined other operational and business
risks and confirm that they have established systems to mitigate the significant risks.

Other than bank balances, the organisation does not have any significant financial instruments. Liquidity risk is managed
by the use of short term money market accounts when funds are available.

e. Fundraising

The charitable group doesn’t actively fundraise but appreciates donations from the public. The charitable group does not
use any professional fundraiser or commercial participator to carry out activities on the charitable group’s behalf.

Due to the low level of fundraising the charitable group undertakes, the charitable group is not a participant of a
voluntary scheme for regulating fundraising, or any voluntary standard of fundraising for the activities carried out on
behalf of the charitable group. Should the charitable group at some point in the future undertake a specific fundraising
campaign or start to generate more income through fundraising, the trustees will look to sign up to a voluntary
fundraising code.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2024

Structure, governance and management (continued)
f. Financial reserves policy
The reserves of the company are accumulated substantially from earned income and not through donations.

The charity needs reserves for the following reasons:

To maintain the fabric of its buildings to a level acceptable to its members and itself, and to project an image of a
professional organisation.

To be able to purchase resources to enable the company to keep up to date with fast moving and changing
technology in order to deliver its business.

{in a continuous climate of change in training, education and development, to allow the company time to meet and
adjust to those changes.

To give the company the financial resources to expand its business and facilities to meet member needs.

The company will monitor its resources on a regular basis along with its income and expenditure.

It will also submit its accounts to annual audit and report back to its members.

The policy will be reviewed annually by the Board of Directors, prior to the AGM and will be monitored month by
month by the Managing Director.

As at the year end, the total unrestricted reserves of the group was £3,049,824 (2023: 2,825,257) of which free reserves
(unrestricted reserves not represented by intangible assets, tangible assets and investment property) were £686,478
(2023: £560,970).

Plans for future periods

Looking ahead, we will:

Continue to develop the engineering apprenticeships we offer in line with employer needs.
Train & retain our-staffto ensure the best learning experience for our learners. .
Invest in the technology and equipment required.

Continue to be the provider of choice for engineering Apprenticeships and training.

Ensure we comply with the Df€, Ofsted, HSE, EA and other regulatory bodies.

Plan new collaborations or strengthening existing ones.

TRUSTEES' REPORT (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2024

Statement of Trustees' responsibilities

The Trustees (who are also the directors of the charitable company for the purposes of company law) are responsible for
preparing the Trustees’ report including the Strategic report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable
law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

Company law requires the Trustees to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under company law, the
Trustees must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state
of affairs of the Group and the charitable company and of their incoming resources and application of resources, including
their income and expenditure, for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the Trustees are required to:

. select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
. observe the methods and principles of the Charities SORP (FRS 102);
. make judgments and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;

state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards (FRS 102) have been followed, subject to any material
departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements;

prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group
will continue in business.

The Trustees are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group
and the charitable company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the
Group and the charitable company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies
Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and the charitable company and hence for
taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

Disclosure of information to auditors

Each of the persons who are Trustees at the time when this Trustees’ report is approved has confirmed that:

° so far as that Trustee is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the charitable group's auditors are
unaware, and

that Trustee has taken all the steps that ought to have been taken as a Trustee in order to be aware of any relevant
audit information and to establish that the charitable group's auditors are aware of that information.

Auditors

The auditors, BHP LLP, have indicated their willingness to continue in office. The designated Trustees will propose a
motion reappointing the auditors at a meeting of the Trustees.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF APPRIS CHARITY LIMITED

Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of Appris Charity Limited (the ‘parent charitable company’) and its subsidiaries
(the group’) for the year ended 31 July 2024 which comprise the Consolidated statement of financial activities, the
Consolidated balance sheet, the Charitable company balance sheet, the Consolidated statement of cash flows and the
related notes, including a summary of significant accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that has been
applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including Financial Reporting
Standard 102 ‘The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland’ (United Kingdom Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice).

In our opinion the financial statements:

. give a true and fair view of the state of the Group's and of the parent charitable company's affairs as at 31 July
2024 and of the Group's incoming resources and application of resources, including its income and expenditure for
the year then ended;

have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and the Charities Act 2011.

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial
statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are
relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the United Kingdom, including the Financial Reporting Council's Ethical
Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that
the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Conclusions relating to going concern

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the Trustees’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in
” the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions
that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group's or the parent charitable company's ability to
continue as .a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for
issue.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the Trustees with respect to going concern are described in the relevant
sections of this report.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF APPRIS CHARITY LIMITED (CONTINUED)

Other information

The other information comprises the information included in the Annual report other than the financial statements and
our Auditors’ report thereon. The Trustees are responsible for the other information contained within the Annual report.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise
explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. Our responsibility is to read
the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the
financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially
misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine
whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have
performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that
fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

e the information given in the Annual report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is
consistent with the financial statements.
the Annual report has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

Matters on which we are required to report by exception

In the light of our knowledge and understanding of the charitable company and its environment obtained in the course of
the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the Annual report.

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which Companies Act 2006 requires us to
report to you if, in our opinion:

° the parent charitable company has not kept adequate and sufficient accounting records, or returns adequate for
our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or

the parent charitable company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns;
or

certain disclosures of Trustees' remuneration specified by law are not made; or

we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or

the Trustees were not entitled to prepare the financial statements in accordance with the small companies regime
and take advantage of the small companies’ exemptions in preparing the Annual report and from the requirement
to prepare a Strategic Report.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF APPRIS CHARITY LIMITED (CONTINUED)

Responsibilities of trustees

As explained more fully in the Trustees' responsibilities statement, the Trustees (who are also the directors of the
charitable-company for the purposes of company law) are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and
for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the Trustees determine is necessary
to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or
error.

In preparing the financial statements, the Trustees are responsible for assessing the Group's and the parent charitable
company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the
going concern basis of accounting unless the Trustees either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent charitable
company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an Auditors' report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs
(UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic
decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line
with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The
extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below:

We gained an understanding of the legal and regulatory framework applicable to the group and the sector in which it
operates and considered the risk of acts by the group that were contrary to applicable laws and regulations, including
fraud. We designed audit procedures to respond to the risk, recognising that the risk of not detecting a material
misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve
deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion.

We focused on laws and regulations, relevant to the group, which could give rise to a material misstatement in the
financial statements. Our tests included agreeing the financial statement disclosures to underlying supporting
documentation, enquiries with management, review of operation of controls within the year, and review of expenses,
such as legal costs. There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described and, the further removed non-
compliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less
likely we would become aware of it.

As part of our audit, we addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including testing of journals and
review of nominal ledger. We evaluated whether there was evidence of bias by the trustees that represented a risk of
material misstatement due to fraud.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting
Council's website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our Auditors’ report.

Use of our report

This report is made solely to the charitable company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the
Companies Act 2006, and to the charitable company's trustees, as a body, Part 4 of the Charities (Accounts and Reports)
Regulations 2008. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the charitable company's members
those matters we are required to state to them in an Auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the charitable company and its
members, as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2024

1, General information

Appris Charity Limited is a charitable company limited by guarantee incorporated in England and Wales. The
members of the company are the Trustees named on page 1. In the event of the company being wound up, the
liability in respect of the guarantee is limited to £10 per member of the company. The registered office is B.T.A.L.
House, Laisterdyke, Bradford, West Yorkshire, BD4 8AT.

2. Accounting policies
2.1 Basis of preparation of financial statements

The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Charities SORP (FRS 102) - Accounting
and Reporting by Charities: Statement of Recommended Practice applicable to charities preparing their
accounts in accordance with the Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland
(FRS 102) (effective 1 January 2019), the Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of
Ireland (FRS 102) and the Companies Act 2006.

Appris Charity Limited meets the definition of a public benefit entity under FRS 102. Assets and liabilities are
initially recognised at historical cost or transaction value unless otherwise stated in the relevant accounting
policy.

The Consolidated statement of financial activities (SOFA) and Consolidated balance sheet consolidate the
financial statements of the charitable company and its subsidiary undertaking. The results of the subsidiary
are consolidated on a line by line basis.

The charitable company has taken advantage of the exemption allowed under section 408 of the Companies
Act 2006 and has not presented its own Statement of financial activities in these financial statements.

2.2 Going concern

The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis with total income again exceeding
the expenditure incurred in the year.

The unrestricted funds being carried forwards are in surplus of £3,049,824 as at 31 July 2024 allowing for long
term planning to further support the achievement of the group’s objectives.

The Trustees have therefore concluded that it is appropriate to continue to use the going concern basis in the
preparation of these financial statements. They do not believe there are any material uncertainties in relation
to the going concern assessment.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2024

2. Accounting policies (continued)

2.3 Income

All income is recognised once the charitable company has entitlement to the income, it is probable that the
income will be received and the amount of income receivable can be measured reliably.

Grants are included in the Consolidated statement of financial activities on a receivable basis. The balance of
income received for specific purposes but not expended during the period is shown in the relevant funds on
the Balance sheet. Where income is received in advance of entitlement of receipt, its recognition is deferred
and included in creditors as deferred income. Where entitlement occurs before income is received, the
income is accrued.

Government grants relating to tangible fixed assets are treated as deferred income and released to the
Consolidated statement of financial activities over the expected useful lives of the assets concerned. Other
grants are credited to the Consolidated statement of financial activities as the related expenditure is incurred.

Income tax recoverable in relation to investment income is recognised at the time the investment income is
receivable.

Other income is recognised in the period in which it is receivable and to the extent the goods have been
provided or on completion of the service.

2.4 Expenditure

Expenditure is recognised once there is a legal or constructive obligation to transfer economic benefit to a
third party, it is probable that a transfer of economic benefits will be required in settlement and the amount
of the obligation can be measured reliably. Expenditure is classified by activity. The costs of each activity are
made up of the total of direct costs and shared costs, including support costs involved in undertaking each
activity. Direct costs attributable to a single activity are allocated directly to that activity. Shared costs which
contribute to more than one activity and support costs which are not attributable to a single activity are
apportioned between those activities on a basis consistent with the use of resources. Central staff costs are
allocated on the basis of time spent, and depreciation charges allocated on the portion of the asset’s use.

Expenditure on charitable activities is incurred on directly undertaking the activities which further the Group's
objectives, as well as any associated support costs.

All expenditure is inclusive of irrecoverable VAT.
2.5 Interest receivable
Interest on funds held on deposit is included when receivable and the amount can be measured reliably by

the Group; this is normally upon notification of the interest paid or payable by the institution with whom the
funds are deposited.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2024

2. Accounting policies (continued)

2.6 Taxation

The charitable company is considered to pass the tests set out in Paragraph 1 Schedule 6 of the Finance Act
2010 and therefore it meets the definition of a charitable company for UK corporation tax purposes.
Accordingly, the charitable company is potentially exempt from taxation in respect of income or capital gains
received within categories covered by Chapter 3 Part 11 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 or Section 256 of the
Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, to the extent that such income or gains are applied exclusively to
charitable purposes.

2.7 Goodwill

Positive goodwill is capitalised, classified as an asset on the balance sheet and amortised over its useful
economic life. It is reviewed for impairment at the end of the first full financial year following the acquisition
and in other periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be
recoverable.

Goodwill was acquired by way of transfer of all assets and liabilities from Leeds Training Services Limited, a
company registered in England and Wales, on 1 August 2011, and is now fully amortised.

Negative goodwill is capitalised and classified as a negative asset on the balance sheet. Negative goodwill
relating to net current assets was immediately amortised and negative goodwill relating to investment
Property is being carried forward.

2.8 Tangible fixed assets and depreciation

Tangible fixed assets costing £100 or more are capitalised and recognised when future economic benefits are
probable and the cost or value of the asset can be measured reliably.

Tangible fixed assets are initially recognised at cost. After recognition, under the cost model, tangible fixed
assets are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. All costs
incurred to bring a tangible fixed asset into its intended working condition should be included in the
measurement of cost.

Depreciation is charged so as to allocate the cost of tangible fixed assets less their residual value over their
estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method.

Depreciation is provided on the following bases:

Freehold property - 2% straight line
Plant and machinery - 10-20% straight line
Fixtures and fittings - 10-33% straight line

2. Accounting policies (continued)

2.9 Investments

Fixed asset investments are a form of financial instrument and are initially recognised at their transaction cost
and subsequently measured at fair value at the Balance sheet date, unless the value cannot be measured
reliably in which case it is measured at cost less impairment. Investment gains and losses, whether realised or
unrealised, are combined and presented as ‘Gains/(Losses) on investments’ in the Consolidated statement of
financial activities.

Investments in subsidiaries are valued at cost less provision for impairment.
2.10 Debtors

Trade and other debtors are recognised at the settlement amount after any trade discount offered.
Prepayments are valued at the amount prepaid net of any trade discounts due.

2.11 Cash at bank and in hand

Cash at bank and in hand includes cash and short-term highly liquid investments with a short maturity of
three months or less from the date of acquisition or opening of the deposit or similar account.

2.12 Liabilities and provisions

Liabilities are recognised when there is an obligation at the Balance sheet date as a result of a past event, it is
probable that a transfer of economic benefit will be required in settlement, and the amount of the settlement
can be estimated reliably.

Liabilities are recognised at the amount that the charitable company anticipates it will pay to settle the debt
or the amount it has received as advanced payments for the goods or services it must provide.

Provisions are measured at the best estimate of the amounts required to settle the obligation. Where the
effect of the time value of money is material, the provision is based on the present value of those amounts,
discounted at the pre-tax discount rate that reflects the risks specific to the liability. The unwinding of the
discount is recognised in the Consolidated statement of financial activities as a finance cost.

2.13 Financial instruments
The Group only has financial assets and financial liabilities of a kind that qualify as basic financial instruments.
Basic financial instruments are initially recognised at transaction value and subsequently measured at their
settlement value with the exception of bank loans which are subsequently measured at amortised cost using
the effective interest method.

2.14 Operating leases

Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to the Consolidated statement of financial activities on a
straight-line basis over the lease term.

2.15 Pensions

The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme and the pension charge represents the amounts

payable by the Group to the fund in respect of the year.

2.16 Fund accounting

General funds are unrestricted funds which are available for use at the discretion of the Trustees in
furtherance of the general objectives of the Group and which have not been designated for other purposes.

Restricted funds are funds which are to be used in accordance with specific restrictions imposed by donors or
which have been raised by the Group for particular purposes. The costs of raising and administering such
funds are charged against the specific fund. The aim and use of each restricted fund is set out in the notes to

the financial statements.

Investment income, gains and losses are allocated to the appropriate fund.
