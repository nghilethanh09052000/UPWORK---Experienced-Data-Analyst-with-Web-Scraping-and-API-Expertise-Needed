performance-related conditions are recognised in income only when the performance-related
conditions are met. Grants received before the revenue recognition criteria are satisfied are

1 Accounting policies (continued)

The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of tax rates and laws that have been
enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date in the countries where the company operates
and generates taxable income.

Deferred tax shall be recognised in respect of all timing differences at the reporting date, except as
otherwise required by FRS102. Timing differences are differences between taxable profits and total
comprehensive income as stated in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of income
and expenses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in

financial statements. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been

enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.

Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets shall be recognised only to the extent that it is
probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future
taxable profits.

Depreciation

construction over their estimated useful lives, as follows:

Asset class Depreciation method and rate

straight-line basis over the shorter of the useful life of the asset and the lease term. The
corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the Balance Sheet as a finance lease obligation.

Lease payments are apportioned between finance costs in the Profit and Loss Account and reduction
of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance
of the liability.

Contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as employee benefit expense when they
are due. If contribution payments exceed the contribution due for service, the excess is recognised as
a prepayment.

maximum of ten years. During the year to 31 March 2024 payments of Enil (2023 - £200,000) were
