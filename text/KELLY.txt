STRATEGIC REPORT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023

Introduction
The directors present the strategic report and financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023.
Business review

The Company has reported turnover of £115.4m (1 January 2023: £87.3m) and a pre-tax profit of £10.8m for the
year ended 31 December 2023 (1 January 2023: £10.7m). The Company has total shareholder funds of £11.7m
as at 31 December 2023 (2 January 2022: £13.5m).

. In the period, turnover at £115.4m was £28.1m more than the previous period.

. The strategy of business going forward is to continue to develop our strong relationships with Virgin
Media; CityFibre and Hughes Network Services Ltd and to continue to expand the range of services we provide.

Principal risks and uncertainties

We see limited risks with our core business with perhaps the exception of the high level of business we enjoy
with three clients. This is being addressed with ongoing investment and the development of other opportunities
within the Kelly Group.

While staff shortages are considered a risk, the directors have tailored recruitment and retention strategies as a
means of minimising the impact.

The Business is aware and monitors closely the ever-evolving risks associated with inflationary pressures and
looks to mitigate against these increased costs where possible.

Financial key performance indicators

The directors of Kelly Communications Group Limited, the ultimate parent company, manage the Group's
operations. on a divisional basis.

The board uses Key Performance Indicators (‘KPlI’s) to monitor the Company's performance and regularly
reviews the key risks to the business. In addition to regular board reporting and timely management accounts,
the Company monitors a range of activities including health and safety, profitability, cash management, customer
satisfaction, order book and other financial and non financial measures.

. The Company is affected by the scale and profitability of individual projects, therefore turnover and profits
are monitored contract by contract on a weekly basis.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023

The directors present their report and the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023.
Directors’ responsibilities statement

The directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic Report, the Directors' Report and the financial
statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.

directors have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice), including Financial Reporting
Standard 102 ‘The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland’. Under company
law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair
view of the state of affairs of the company and of the profit or loss of the company for that period.

In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:

select suitable accounting policies for the company's financial statements and then apply them
consistently;

make judgments and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures
disclosed and explained in the financial statements;

prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the
company will continue in business.

The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain
the company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the
company and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They
are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

Principal activity

The principal activity of the company was that of a telecommunications, cable television and broadband
installation contractor specialsing in cabling and activation services.

Results and dividends

The profit for the year, after taxation, amounted to £8,192,268 (2023 - £8,518,642).

assistance with initial training courses is given. Once employed, a career plan is developed so as to ensure

employees who become disabled, to enable them to perform work identified as appropriate to their aptitudes and
abilities.

information to employees. There is regular consultation with employees, taking their views into account in
making decisions affecting the performance of the company.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF KELLY COMMUNICATIONS LIMITED

Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of Kelly Communications Limited (the 'company’) for the year ended
31 December 2023, which comprise the Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Balance Sheet, the
Statement of Changes in Equity and the related notes, including a summary of significant accounting policies.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United
Kingdom Accounting Standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 102 ‘The Financial Reporting Standard
applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland’ (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

In our opinion the financial statements:

give a true and fair view of the state of the company's affairs as at 31 December 2023 and of its profit for
the year then ended;

have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice; and

have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable
law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit
of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the company in accordance with the
ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the United Kingdom, including
the Financial Reporting Council's Ethical Standard and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in
accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Conclusions relating to going concern

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of
accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or
conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a
going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the
relevant sections of this report.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF KELLY COMMUNICATIONS LIMITED
(CONTINUED)

Other information

The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report other than the financial
statements and our Auditors’ Report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained
within the Annual Report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and,
except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion
thereon. Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other
information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the
audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent
material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the
financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material
misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors' Report for the financial year for which the
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and

. the Strategic Report and the Directors' Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal
requirements.

Matters on which we are required to report by exception

In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the course of
the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic Report or the Directors’ Report.

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006
requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:

e

adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been
received from branches not visited by us; or

the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or

certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or

we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

Responsibilities of directors

As explained more fully in the Directors' Responsibilities Statement set out on page 3, the directors are
responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair
view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of fi nancial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the company's ability to
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going
concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or
have no realistic alternative but to do so.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF KELLY COMMUNICATIONS LIMITED
(CONTINUED)

Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an Auditors’ Report that includes our
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures
in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities,
including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is
detailed below:

* Enquiry of management and those charged with governance around actual and potential litigation and claims;

« Performing audit work over the risk of management override of controls, including testing of journal entries and
other adjustments for appropriateness, evaluating the business rationale of significant transactions outside the
normal course of business and reviewing accounting estimates for bias;

* Reviewing minutes of meetings of those charged with governance;

« Reviewing financial statement disclosures and testing to supporting documentation to assess compliance with
applicable laws and regulations.

Because of the inherent limitations of an audit, there is a risk that we will not detect all irregularities, including
those leading to a material misstatement in the financial statements or non-compliance with regulation. This risk
increases the more that compliance with a law or regulation is removed from the events and transactions
reflected in the financial statements, as we will be less likely to become aware of instances of non-compliance.
The risk is also greater regarding irregularities occurring due to fraud rather than error, as fraud involves
intentional concealment, forgery, collusion, omission or misrepresentation.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial
Reporting Council's website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our
Auditors’ Report.

extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the

Foreign currency translation

Functional and presentation currency

The company's functional and presentational currency is GBP.
Transactions and balances

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the spot exchange
rates at the dates of the transactions.

At each period end foreign currency monetary items are translated using the closing rate. Non-
monetary items measured at historical cost are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the
transaction and non-monetary items measured at fair value are measured using the exchange rate
when fair value was determined.

Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of transactions and from the
translation at period-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are recognised in profit or loss except when deferred in other comprehensive income as
qualifying cash flow hedges.

Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings and cash and cash equivalents are
presented in the Statement of Comprehensive Income within ‘finance income or costs’. All other
foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in profit or loss within ‘other operating income’.

Revenue

Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the
company and the revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is measured as the fair value of the
consideration received or receivable, excluding discounts, rebates, value added tax and other sales
taxes. The following criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised:

Rendering of services

Revenue from a contract to provide services is recognised in the period in which the services are
provided in accordance with the stage of completion of the contract when all of the following
conditions are satisfied:

. the amount of revenue can be measured reliably;

° it is probable that the company will receive the consideration due under the contract;
. the stage of completion of the contract at the end of the reporting period can be measured
reliably; and

° the costs incurred and the costs to complete the contract can be measured reliably.

Cost of sales and administration expenses

Certain categories of expenses that had been allocated to administration expenses in previous years
that have been allocated to cost of sales in the year ended 31 December and vice versa. The
directors consider that this provides a better presentation of both expense categories. The
comparative figures for year ended 1 January 2023 have also been reallocated. There is no impact
on results and reserves for year ended 31 December 2023 or year ended 1 January 2023 arising
from this reallocation.

Operating leases: the company as lessee

Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the
lease term.

Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to sign an operating lease are recognised on a
straight-line basis over the lease term, unless another systematic basis is representative of the time
pattern of the lessee's benefit from the use of the leased asset.

Research and development

In the research phase of an internal project it is not possible to demonstrate that the project will
generate future economic benefits and hence all expenditure on research shall be recognised as an
expense when it is incurred. Intangible assets are recognised from the development phase of a
project if and only if certain specific criteria are met in order to demonstrate the asset will generate
probable future economic benefits and that its cost can be reliably measured. The capitalised
development costs are subsequently amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic
lives, which range from 3 to 6 years.

If it is not possible to distinguish between the research phase and the development phase of an
internal project, the expenditure is treated as if it were all incurred in the research phase only.

Finance costs

Finance costs are charged to profit or loss over the term of the debt using the effective interest
method so that the amount charged is at a constant rate on the carrying amount. Issue costs are
initially recognised as a reduction in the proceeds of the associated capital instrument.

Pensions

Defined contribution pension plan

The company operates a defined contribution pension plan for its employees. A defined contribution
plan is a pension plan under which the company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. Once
the contributions have been paid the company has no further payment obligations.

The contributions are recognised as an expense in profit or loss when they fall due. Amounts not paid

are shown in accruals as a liability in the Balance Sheet. The assets of the plan are held separately
from the company in independently administered funds.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023

2. Accounting policies (continued)

2.10 Current and deferred taxation

The tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in profit or loss
except that a charge attributable to an item of income and expense recognised as other
comprehensive income or to an item recognised directly in equity is also recognised in other
comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.

The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of tax rates and laws that have been
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date in the countries where the company
operates and generates income.

Deferred tax balances are recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not
reversed by the balance sheet date, except that:

. The recagnition of deferred tax assets is limited to the extent that it is probable that they will be
recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits; and

° Any deferred tax balances are reversed if and when all conditions for retaining associated tax
allowances have been met.

Deferred tax balances are not recognised in respect of permanent differences except in respect of
business combinations, when deferred tax is recognised on the differences between the fair values of
assets acquired and the future tax deductions available for them and the differences between the fair
values of liabilities acquired and the amount that will be assessed for tax. Deferred tax is determined
using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.

2.11 Amounts recoverable on contracts

Amounts recoverable on contracts comprises work completed or measured parts thereof not yet
invoiced to customers and is stated after making due allowance for irrecoverable amounts. Profit on
contracting activities is taken as work progresses, unless a more conservative approach is
necessary. The percentage margin on each individual contract is the lower of the margin earned to
date and that forecast to completion, taking account of agreed claims. Profit for the period includes
settlement of claims arising on completed contracts with a provision made for notified claims during
the period where further work is required.

2.12 Amounts receivable under retentions
The amounts receivable under retentions are included within trade debtors. However, these
retentions are treated as unrealised and only released to the profit and loss account when the period
of constructive obligation ceases and the amounts have been invoiced.

2.13 Intangible assets
Intangible assets are initially recognised at cost. After recognition, under the cost model, intangible
assets are measured at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment

All intangible assets are considered to have a finite useful life. If a reliable estimate of the useful life
cannot be made, the useful life shall not exceed ten years.

Computer software is amortised on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life of 4 years.

2. Accounting policies (continued)

2.14 Tangible fixed assets

Tangible fixed assets under the cost model are stated at historical cost less accumulated
depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Historical cost includes expenditure that is
directly attributable to bringing the asset to the tocation and condition necessary for it to be capable of
operating in the manner intended by management.

Depreciation is charged so as to allocate the cost of assets less their residual value over their
estimated useful lives, on a reducing balance basis.

Depreciation is provided on the following basis:

Plant and machinery - 25% reducing balance
Fixtures and fittings - 25% reducing balance
Computer equipment - 25% reducing balance

The assets’ residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted
prospectively if appropriate, or if there is an indication of a significant change since the last reporting
date.

Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount
and are recognised in profit or loss.

2.15 Valuation of investments
Investments in subsidiaries are measured at cost less accumulated impairment.
Investments in unlisted company shares, whose market value can be reliably determined, are
remeasured to market value at each balance sheet date. Gains and losses on remeasurement are
recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income for the period. Where market value cannot
be reliably determined, such investments are stated at historic cost less impairment.

Investments in listed company shares are remeasured to market value at each balance sheet date.
Gains and losses on remeasurement are recognised in profit or loss for the period.

2.16 Stocks
Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value, being the estimated selling price less
costs to complete and sell. Cost is based on the cost of purchase on a first in, first out basis. Work in
progress and finished goods include labour and attributable overheads.
At each balance sheet date, stocks are assessed for impairment. If stock is impaired, the carrying

amount is reduced to its selling price less costs to complete and sell. The impairment loss is
recognised immediately in profit or loss.

2.17 Debtors
Short-term debtors are measured at transaction price, less any impairment. Loans receivable are

measured initially at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are measured subsequently at amortised
cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment.

Accounting policies (continued)

2.18 Cash and cash equivalents

Cash is represented by cash in hand and deposits with financial institutions repayable without penalty
on notice of not more than 24 hours. Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments that mature in no
more than three months from the date of acquisition and that are readily convertible to known
amounts of cash with insignificant risk of change in value.

2.19 Creditors

Short-term creditors are measured at the transaction price. Other financial liabilities, including bank
loans, are measured initially at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are measured subsequently at
amortised cost using the effective interest method.

2.20 Financial instruments

The company has elected to apply the provisions of Section 11 “Basic Financiat Instruments” of FRS
102 to all of its financial instruments.

Financial instruments are recognised in the company’s Balance Sheet when the company becomes
party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

Financial assets and liabilities are offset, with the net amounts presented in the financial statements,
when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to
settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Basic financial assets

Basic financial assets, which include trade and other receivables, cash and bank balances, are
initially measured at their transaction price including transaction costs and are subsequently carried
at their amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any provision for impairment, unless
the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where the transaction is measured at the
present value of the future receipts discounted at a market rate of interest.

Discounting is omitted where the effect of discounting is immaterial. The company's cash and cash
equivalents, trade and most other receivables due with the operating cycle fall into this category of
financial instruments.

Financial liabilities

Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual
arrangements entered into. An equity instruments any contract that evidences a residual interest in
the assets of the company after the deduction of all its liabilities.

Basic financial liabilities, which include trade and other payables, bank loans and other loans are
initially measured at their transaction price after transaction costs. When this constitutes a financing
transaction, whereby the debt instrument is measured at the present value of the future receipts
discounted at a market rate of interest. Discounting is omitted where the effect of discounting is
immaterial.

Debt instruments are subsequently carried at their amortised cost using the effective interest rate
method.

Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods and services that have been acquired in the ordinary

course of business from suppliers. Trade payables are classified as current liabilities if the payment is
due within one year. If not, they represent non-current liabilities. Trade payables are initially
recognised at their transaction price and subsequently are measured at amortised cost using the
effective interest method. Discounting is omitted where the effect of discounting is immaterial.

2.21 Dividends

Equity dividends are recognised when they become legally payable. Interim equity dividends are
recognised when paid. Final equity dividends are recognised when approved by the shareholders at
an annual general meeting.

Judgments in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty

in the application of the company’s accounting policies, which are described above, management is
required to make judgments, estimates and assumptions about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and underlying assumptions are based on
historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from
these estimates. :

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting
estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that
period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future
periods. :

The key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the
financial statements are described below:

Fixed assets, debtors and provisions

Judgments have been made in relation to the lives of tangible assets and the valuation and recoverability
of trade debtors, the valuation of provisions and the useful economic life and residual values of fixtures
and fittings. The directors have concluded that the valuation of debtors and provisions and asset values
and residual values are appropriate.

Valuation of Stock

Stock is included at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The directors have reviewed the stock
obsolescence policy and are satisfied that stock is fairly valued at the year end.

Amounts recoverable on contracts
Amounts recoverable on contracts are valued at the amount expected to be recovered at the balance

sheet date, with detailed post year end analysis undertaken to ensure the fair value of this accrued
income.
