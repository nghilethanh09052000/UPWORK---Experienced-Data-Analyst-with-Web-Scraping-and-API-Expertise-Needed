ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of preparing the financial statements

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102 "The Financial Reporting Standard
applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland" including the provisions of Section 1A "Small Entities" and the Companies Act 2006.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.

Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty

In the application of the company's accounting policics, the directors are required to make judgements, cstimatcs and assumptions about
the carrying amount of asscts and liabilites that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions
are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the
period in which the estimate is revised where the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods
where the revisions affects both current and future periods,

Turnover
Turnover is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, excluding discounts, rebates, value added tax and
other sales taxes.

Revenue is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the goods and services provided in the normal
course of business, and is shown net of VAT and other sales related taxes. The fair value of consideration takes into account trade
discounts, settlement discounts and volume rebates.

When cash inflows are deferred and represent a financing arrangement, the fair value of the consideration is the present value of the
future receipts. The difference between the fair value of the consideration and the nominal amount received is recognised as interest
income.

Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the good s have passed to the
buyer (usually on dispatch of the goods), the amount of the revenue can be measured reliably, it is probable that the economic benefits
associated with the transactions will flow to the entity and the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be
measured reliably.

Revenue from contracts for the provision of professional services is recognised by reference to the stage of completion when the stage
of completion, costs incurred and costs to complete can be estimated reliably. The stage of completion is calculated by comparing costs
incurred, mainly in relation to the contractual hourly staff rates and materials, as a proportion of total costs. Where the outcome cannot
be estimated reliably, revenue is recognised only to the extent of expenses recognised that it it probable will be recovered.

Tangible fixed assets
Depreciation is provided at the following annual rates in order to write off each asset over its estimated useful life.
Plant and machinery etc - 25% on cost

Freehold land and buildings are shown at cost. As it is the company's policy to maintain its properties to a very high standard, the
directors consider that their residual value will not be less than their carrying value. The directors are of the opinion that any charge for
depreciation will not be material, therefore, no provision for depreciation is made. While this policy is not strictly in accordance with
the Financial Reporting Standard on Tangible Fixed Assets, the directors are of the opinion that the financial statements in their current
form continue to give a true and fair view.

Residual value is calculated on prices prevailing at the reporting date, after estimated costs of disposal, for the assets as if it were at the
age and in condition expected at the end of its useful life.

Impairment of fixed assets

At cach reporting period end date, the company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible asscts to determine whether there is any
indication that those asscts have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the assct is
estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of
an individual asset, the company estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents are basic financial asscts and include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term liquid
investments with original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts, Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in
current liabilities,

Taxation
Taxation for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Income Statement, except to the extent that it relates
to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.

Current or deferred taxation assets and liabilities are not discounted.

Current tax is recognised at the amount of tax payable using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by
the balance sheet date.

Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date.

Timing differences arise from the inclusion of income and expenses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are
recognised in financial statements. Deferred tax is measured using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by
the year end and that are expected to apply to the reversal of the timing difference.

Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered
against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.

Financial instruments
The company has elected to apply the provisions of section 11 'basic financial instruments’ and section 12 ‘other financial instruments
issues’ of FRS 102 to all of its financial instruments.

Financial instruments are recognised in the company's balance sheet when the company becomes party to contractual provisions of the
instruments.

Financial assets and liabilities are offset, with the net amounts presented in the financial statements, when there is a legally enforceable
tight to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability
simultaneously.

Basic Financial instruments

Basic financial instruments, which include debtors and cash and bank balances, are initially measured at transaction price including
transaction costs and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method unless the arrangement constitutes a
financing transaction, where the transaction is measured at the present value of the future receipts discounted at a market rate of interest.
Financial asscts classified as receivable within one year are not amortised.

Impairment of financial asscts
Financial assets, other than those held at fair value through profit and loss, are assessed for indicators of impairments at cach reporting
date.

Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial
recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows have been affected. If an asset is impaired, the impairment loss is the
difference between the carrying amount and the present value of the estimated cash flows discounted at the assets original effective
interest rate, The impairment loss is recognised in the profit or loss.

If there is a decrease in the impairment loss arising from an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the impairment is
reversed. The reversal is such that the current carrying amount does not exceed what the carrying amount would have been, had the
impairment not previously been recognised. The impairment reversal is recognised in profit or loss.

Derecognition of financial assets
Financial assets are recognised only when the contractual rights to the cashflows form the asset expire of are settled, or when the
company transfers the financial assets and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to another entity, or if some significant
risks and rewards of ownership are retained but control of the asset has transferred to another party that is able to sell the asset in its
entirety to an unrelated third party.

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents are basic financial assets and include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term liquid
investments with original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in
current liabilities

Classification of financial liabilities
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An
equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the company after deducting all of its liabilities.

Basic financial liabilities

Basic financial liabilities, including creditors, bank loans, loans from fellow group companies and preference shares that are classified
as debt , are initially recognised at transaction price unless the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where the debt
instrument is measured at the present value of the future payments discounted at a market rate of interest. Financial liabilities classified
as payable within one year are not amortised.

Debt instruments are subsequently carried at amortised cost, using the effective interest method.

Trade creditors are obligations to pay for goods and services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers.
Amounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less. If not, they are presented as non-current
liabilities. Trade creditors are recognised initially at transaction price and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective
interest method.

Derecognition of financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the company's contractual obligations expire or are discharged or cancelled.

Going concern

After reviewing the company's forecasts and projections, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the company has adequate
resources to continue in operational existence for the foresecable future. The company, therefore continues to adopt the going concern
policy in preparing its financial statements.

EMPLOYEES AND DIRECTORS

The average number of employees during the year was 54 (2023 - 66).
