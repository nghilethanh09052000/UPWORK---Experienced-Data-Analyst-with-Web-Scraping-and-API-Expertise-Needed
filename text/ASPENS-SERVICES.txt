STRATEGIC REPORT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2024

The directors present the strategic report and financial statements for the year ended 30" September 2024.
Business and Financial Review

The company had another successful year operationally, increasing turnover by 26% to over £132M. Our pipeline, for
new business is at record levels, as the trend to outsource catering provision accelerates coupled with a number of
loca! authority providers exiting the market.

We have invested heavily in our regional team and support services personne! to be better able to gain, mobilise and
retain the new contract opportunities available.

Our financial performance has continued to improve post covid and the early trading in the 24/25 financial year follows
this trend. We have increased our market share by ensuring we remain competitive on price and quality, growing our
business in a sustainable fashion and as we move to a market leadership Position, we continue to build on our 16 years
of industry-leading growth.

Key Finance performance indicators for the year:

The directors consider the key performance indicators of our business to be EBITDA and EBITDA as a percentage of
revenue.

EBITDA Comparison to Sept 2024 to Sept 2023
Revenue 132,131,277 104,900,759
Revenue Growth % 26% 28%
Profit/(Loss) for the year 2,136,933 611,415
Interest 217,986 242,493
Taxation : 805,402 70,832
Depreciation 1,112,855 1,381,538
Amortisation 96,328 98,641
EBITDA 4,369,504 2,404,919
EBITDA as a % of Revenue 3.3% 2.3%

The directors are pleased with the improvement in performance and the overall result. We are on track to increase our
PBIT and EBITDA in future years, further strengthening our balance sheet whist continuing to offer our clients a market
specific approach to their individual needs.

ASPENS-SERVICES LIMITED

STRATEGIC REPORT (continued)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2024

Principal Risks and Uncertainties

The company continually monitors the risks to our business and our directors recognise and manage those risks
appropriately.

Health and Safety

Food Hygiene and Health and Safety statistics are compiled daily and are shared with business leaders regularly. We
train our teams on how to manage and mitigate risks within our environment of kitchen and catering facilities. There is
a constant emphasis on retraining and, where incidents occur, investigation and feedback to prevent future issues.

All areas of health and safety are documented and action taken where necessary to ensure we minimise risks to our
team members.

Our audit teams manage our H&S and Food Hygiene reporting systems, whist also checking compliance and liaising
with local inspectors. We operate to the highest standards of health and safety within our catering areas and are
delighted to report that over 99% of our business has an EHO food safety score of 4 or 5 stars.

Financial
Our key financial risks are cash liquidity within our business and the security of our supply chain.

We actively manage our cash liquidity which will enable us to accelerate our loan repayments and will make final
payment to the outstanding term loan by February 2025. These changes have ensured we have appropriate cash
headroom as we continue to grow our business. We monitor our cash position on a weekly basis through our Treasury
function to ensure we make best use of the funding available.

Within our supply chain we ensure we have multiple sources of supply, so that any failure (although unlikely due to
our up-front due diligence) can be mitigated in a timely manner. This is a risk that continues to be monitored regularly
by our supply chain partner A.V.E (Added Value Enterprises) as they fully understand the pressures that much of the
hospitality market is experiencing and how that may impact on our service delivery.

Economic Environment & Government actions

The current economic environment continues to present challenges to all UK companies, coupled with the changes in
taxation and national insurance costs imposed upon business by the chancellor’s autumn 2024 budget. We manage
our risk by choosing to operate in a sector which has lower commercial risk (pupils will always require a food service
whilst attending school) and clients are insulated from commercial pressures such as rent, rates and cashflow
challenges. Although the sector does offer lower returns than the higher risk ‘business and industry’ market, the
outsourcing trend in education catering continues to accelerate, making this an increasingly attractive sector of the
industry. We are comfortable to operate in a lower margin environment as we have an intimate knowledge of service
provision to schools and how to maximise value to our clients, gained over many years of specialism. In addition, we
do not have exposure to large central contracts from loca! councils, unlike many of our competitors. Our single largest
contract represents less than 6.5% of our debt book and we have virtually no bad debt issues.


ASPENS-SERVICES LIMITED

STRATEGIC REPORT (continued)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2024

Statement by the directors on the performance of their statutory duties in accordance with Section 172(1) of
the Companies Act 2006

The board of directors of Aspens-Services Limited consider, both individually and collectively, that they have acted in
good faith to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its stakeholders and employees (as set out in
$172(1) of the Act) in the decisions they made during the year ended 30 September 2024.

Aspens-Services Limited Vision and Values of Respect, Continuous Improvement and Ownership are the foundation
of our approach in business and underpin our colleague and customer interactions. Our success has been built upon
a business culture focused upon our customers and the children we serve. Whilst our business strategy and our
operational performance evolve, our vision and values remain constant.

The directors and senior leadership teams regularly engage across a range of stakeholders to understand how they
can help and challenge, ensuring our customers are at the heart of everything we do. Forums and discussions at all
levels, help to shape the key decisions and strategies during the financial year and longer-term plan.

We are committed to ensuring that all our food concepts address the requirements of our diverse customer needs and
that of the wider community. We have a process of continuously improving our menus incorporating feedback from our
customers, along with addressing special dietary requirements and the technicalities of allergen management and
Natasha’s law compliance.

Key stakeholders also include our suppliers, (who are predominantly British based) ensuring good provenance and
sustainability, an area which is of importance to us, our customers, and the children we serve. The way in which we
engage is tailored to meet the requirements of individual suppliers, ranging from holding supplier forums to regular
reviews of our service and menu proposition.

Our valued colleagues form the basis of our business and are the key to how we ensure we are different to our
competition. Emerging from a pandemic, colleague safety has and will always be paramount, along with an increasing
focus on mental health and wellbeing. We have put in place a series of programmes to ensure we address the needs
of our diverse workforce whilst listening and acting upon their views.

We recognise our colleagues as our most important asset and are a responsible employer in our approach to wellbeing,
hybrid working, pay and benefits. The company continues to offer learning and development opportunities to colleagues

in the form of apprenticeships and internal and external training courses, with a significant commitment to both on and
off job training.

The health, safety of our colleagues is of the highest importance and key metrics are monitored at board level. We
continue to provide additional investment in our QHSE team in line with our success in gaining new schools.

Aspens continues to invest in our long-term support infrastructure and systems, and have further improved our finance,
and menu management systems to improve our customer and colleagues’ interactions.

ASPENS-SERVICES LIMITED

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF ASPENS-SERVICES LIMITED

Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of Aspens-Services Limited (the 'company') for the year ended 30 September
2024 which comprise the statement of comprehensive income, the balance sheet, the statement of changes in equity, the
statement of cash flows and notes to the financial statements, including significant accounting policies. The financial
reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards,
including Financial Reporting Standard 102 The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

In our opinion the financial statements:

« give a true and fair view of the state of the company's affairs as at 30 September 2024 and of its profit for the
year then ended, and

e have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, and

« have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law.
Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the
financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the company in accordance with the ethical
requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical
Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe
that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Conclusions relating to going concern

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting
in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or
conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going
concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant
sections of this report.

Other information

The other information comprises the information included in the annual report other than the financial statements and
our auditor's report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual
teport. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise
explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. Our responsibility is to read
the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial
statements, or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we
identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this
gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, °
we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.

Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
{n our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of our audit:
e the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial

statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements, and
e the strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

-11-

ASPENS-SERVICES LIMITED

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT (continued)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2024

Matters on which we are required to report by exception

In the fight of the knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the course of the
audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report. We have nothing to
report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if,
in our opinion:

e adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from
branches not visited by us, or

¢ the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns, or

* certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by faw are not made, or

*® we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

Responsibilities of directors

As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of
the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as
the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for
assessing the company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern
and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the company or to cease
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance
with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error
and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below.

Extent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities including fraud

We gained an understanding of the legal and regulatory framework applicable to the company and the sector in which
it operates and considered the risk of acts by the company that were contrary to applicable laws and regulations, including
fraud. We designed audit procedures to respond to the risk, recognising that the risk of not detecting a material
misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate
concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion.

We focused on laws and regulations which could give rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements,
including, but not limited to the Companies Act 2006, taxation legislation, data protection, anti-bribery, employment,
environmental and health and safety legislation.

Audit response to risks identified

Our tests included agreeing the financial statement disclosures to underlying supporting documentation, analytical review,
the relevance and accuracy of accounting estimates, enquiries with management and reviewing meeting minutes of those
charged with governance. There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above and, the further
temoved non-compliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial
statements, the less likely we would become aware of it. We did not identify any key audit matters relating to irregularities,
including fraud. As in all our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including
testing journals and evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that represent a risk of material
misstatements due to fraud.

-12-

ASPENS-SERVICES LIMITED

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT (continued)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2024

It should be noted that Auditing standards limit the audit procedures required to identify non-compliance with laws
and regulations to enquiry of the directors and other management and the inspection of regulatory and legal
correspondence, if any.

A further description of our responsibilities is available on the Financial Reporting Council's website at:
https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor's report.

Use of our report

This report is made solely to the company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company's members those
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company's
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

’ Accounting policies

Company information
Aspens-Services Limited is a private company limited by shares incorporated in England and Wales. The
registered office is Teme House, Whittington, Worcester, Worcestershire, WR5 2RY.

Accounting convention ;
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 102 "The Financial Reporting Standard
applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland” ("FRS 102") and the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

The financial statements are prepared in sterling, which is the functional currency of the company. Monetary
amounts in these financial statements are rounded to the nearest £.

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention. The principal accounting
policies adopted are set out below.

Going concern

At the time of approving the financial statements, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the company
has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus, the directors
continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.

Reporting year
The reporting year is for 1 October 2023 to 30 September 2024.

Turnover
Turnover represents amounts receivable for goods and services net of VAT.

Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods
have passed to the buyer (the provision of services), the amount of revenue can be measured reliably, it is
probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the entity and the costs incurred
or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.

Intangible fixed assets other than goodwill
Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are recognised at cost and are subsequently measured
at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.

Amortisation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over their
useful lives on the following bases:

Software straight line over 5 years

Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost or valuation, net of
depreciation and any impairment losses.

Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over their
useful lives on the following bases:

Leasehold Improvements straight line over 3 years
Fixtures, fittings & equipment straight line over 3 years
Design and build over the life of the contract
Motor vehicles straight line over 3 years

The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the sale proceeds
and the carrying value of the asset and is credited or charged to profit or loss.

Impairment of fixed assets

At each reporting year end date, the company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets
to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such
indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the
impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the
company estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.

Stocks

Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell. Cost comprises
direct materials and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the stocks to their present location and
condition.

At each reporting date, an assessment is made for impairment. Any excess of the carrying amount of stocks
over its estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell is recognised as an impairment loss in profit or
loss. Reversals of impairment losses are also recognised in profit or loss.

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents are basic financial assets and include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks,
other short-term liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts. Bank
overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities.

Financial instruments
The company has elected to apply the provisions of Section 11 ‘Basic Financial Instruments’ and Section 12
‘Other Financia! Instruments Issues' of FRS 102 to all its financia! instruments.

Financial instruments are recognised in the company's balance sheet when the company becomes party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument.

Financial assets and liabilities are offset, with the net amounts presented in the financial statements, when there
is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis
or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Basic financial assets

Basic financial assets, which include debtors and cash and bank balances, are initially measured at transaction
price including transaction costs and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest
method unless the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where the transaction is measured at the
present value of the future receipts discounted at a market rate of interest. Financial assets classified as
receivable within one year are not amortised.

Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets, other than those held at fair value through profit and loss, are assessed for indicators of
impairment at each reporting end date.

Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that
occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows have been affected. If
an asset is impaired, the impairment loss is the difference between the carrying amount and the present value
of the estimated cash flows discounted at the asset's original effective interest rate. The impairment loss is
recognised in profit or loss.

If there is a decrease in the impairment loss arising from an event occurring after the impairment was recognised,
the impairment is reversed. The reversal is such that the current carrying amount does not exceed what the
carrying amount would have been, had the impairment not previously been recognised. The impairment reversal
is recognised in profit or loss.

Derecognition of financial assets

Financial assets are derecognised only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or
are settled, or when the company transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership to another entity, or if some significant risks and rewards of ownership are retained but control of the
asset has transferred to another party that is able to sell the asset in its entirety to an unrelated third party.

Classification of financial liabilities

Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual
arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets
of the company after deducting all its liabilities.

Basic financial liabilities

Basic financial liabilities, including creditors and bank loans are initially recognised at transaction price unless
the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where the debt instrument is measured at the present value
of the future payments discounted at a market rate of interest. Financial liabilities classified as payable within
one year are not amortised.

Debt instruments are subsequently carried at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.

Basic financial liabilities (continued)

Trade creditors are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of
business from suppliers. Amounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year
or less. If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities. Trade creditors are recognised initially at transaction
price and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual
arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets
of the company after deducting all its liabilities.

Derecognition of financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the company’s contractual obligations expire or are discharged or
cancelled.

Equity instruments

Equity instruments issued by the company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of transaction costs.
Dividends payable on equity instruments are recognised as liabilities once they are no longer at the discretion
of the company.

Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.

Current tax

The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported
in the profit and loss account because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in
other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The company’s liability for current
tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting end date.

Deferred tax

Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all timing differences and deferred tax assets are recognised
to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other
future taxable profits. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the timing difference arises from goodwill
or from the initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor
the accounting profit.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting end date and reduced to the extent
that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be
tecovered. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the liability is
settled, or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the profit and loss account, except when -
it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the company has a legally enforceable right to offset current
tax assets and liabilities and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority.

Employee benefits
The costs of short-term employee benefits are recognised as a liability and an expense, unless those costs are
required to be recognised as part of the cost of stock or fixed assets.

The cost of any unused holiday entitlement is recognised in the year in which the employee's services are
received.

Termination benefits are recognised immediately as an expense when the company is demonstrably committed
to terminate the employment of an employee or to provide termination benefits.

Retirement benefits
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.

The company participates in several defined benefit schemes, with the assets and liabilities of the scheme held
separately from those of the company in separate trustee administered funds. The company's contributions are
affected by the surplus or deficit in the schemes; however, it is not possible to identify the company's share of
the underlying assets and liabilities in the schemes on a consistent and reasonable basis. Therefore, in
accordance with FRS102 28.40A, the schemes are accounted for as if they were defined contribution schemes.

Leases
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and
rewards of ownership to the lessees. All other leases are classified as operating leases.

Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets at the lower of the assets fair value at the date of
inception and the present value of the minimum lease payments. The related liability is included in the balance
sheet as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are treated as consisting of capital and interest elements.
The interest is charged to profit or loss so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining
balance of the liability.

Foreign exchange

Transactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing at the
dates of the transactions. At each reporting end date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in
foreign currencies are retransiated at the rates prevailing on the reporting end date. Gains and losses arising on
translation in the year are included in profit or loss.

2 Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the company’s accounting policies, the directors are required to make judgements, estimates
and assumptions about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that
are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting
estimates are recognised in the year in which the estimate is revised where the revision affects only that year,
or in the year of the revision and future periods where the revision affects both current and future years.
3 Turnover and other revenue

Charge to profit or loss in respect of defined contribution schemes: 3,560,500 2,890,988

The charge to profit or loss in respect of defined contribution schemes was £3,550,500 (2023 - £2,890,988),
which includes the Local Authority defined benefit scheme contributions.

Local Authority Defined Benefit Schemes

As a result of outsourcing contracts with education authorities, sometimes referred to as ‘best value
arrangements’ the company obtains Admitted Body Status in a number of Local Authority final salary pension
schemes in respect of a number of designated employees for the duration of the outsourcing contract.

The company pays employers contributions as determined by the relevant scheme based on the scheme
actuary's recommendation at the start of the contract in order to maintain an ongoing fully funded status.

The company is itself protected by contract with the relevant authorities whereby liabilities arising on ill health,
early retirement or redundancy are permitted to be recovered from the contracting party under the terms of
service agreements or the scheme.

The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the company in independent Trust Funds
administered by the relevant Local Authorities. Although the notional allocations of the assets are made in some
schemes, the company does not have specific information about its share of the underlying assets and liabilities
of the schemes or the extent of any deficits in those schemes.

Given the nature of the company’s membership in these multi-employer final salary schemes, in accordance
with FRS102 28.40A contributions are accounted for as it there were defined contribution schemes, the profit
and loss charge being contributions payable in respect on the accounting year.

In cases where the company is in the process of seeking approval from the council the company deduct pension
contributions and include them in other creditors.
