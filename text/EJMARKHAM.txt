DIRECTORS' RESPONSIBILITIES STATEMENT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2023

The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law
and regulations.

Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors have
elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice
(United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company law the directors must not approve the financial
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of the profit
or loss of the company for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:

* select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;

® make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;

© prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company
will continue in business.

The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the company’s
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and enable them to
ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the
assets of the company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other
irregularities.


E.J.MARKHAM & SON LIMITED

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF E.J.MARKHAM & SON LIMITED

Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of E.J.Markham & Son Limited (the 'company’) for the year ended 31 March 2023
which comprise the profit and loss account, the balance sheet and notes to the financial statements, including significant
accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United
Kingdom Accounting Standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 102 The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in
the UK and Republic of Ireland (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice}.

In our opinion the financial statements:
* give a true and fair view of the state of the company's affairs as at 31 March 2023 and of its profit for the year then
ended;
® have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
® have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial
statements section of our report. We are independent of the company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are
relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Material uncertainty relating to going concern

We draw attention to note 1.2, on page 8 of the financial statements concerning the company's ability to continue as a going
concern which indicates that despite net current assets of £672,251 at 31 March 2023, the company’s going concern
assessment may be adversely affected by developments in the wider group headed by SQIB Limited. The company is reliant
on the ongoing support of its parent SQIB Limited. However this support is itself dependent on a number of other events
which are themselves uncertain.

As stated in note 1.2 on page 8, these events or conditions, along with the other matters identified, indicate that a material
uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Our opinion is not
modified in respect of this matter.

Other information

The other information comprises the information included in the annual report other than the financial statements and our
auditor's report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report. Our
opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated
in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion trereon. Our responsibility is to read the other information
and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our
knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material
inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required ta determine whether this gives rise to a material
misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a
material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.

Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of our audit:
® the information given in the directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is
consistent with the financial statements; and
® the directors' report has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements


E.J.MARKHAM & SON LIMITED

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF E.J.MARKHAM & SON LIMITED (CONTINUED)

Matters on which we are required to report by exception

[In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we
have not identified material misstatements in the directors’ report. We have nothing to report in respect of the following
matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:

* adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from
branches not visited by us; or

the financial stacements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or

certain disclosures of remuneration specified by law are not made; or

we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or

the directors were not entitled to prepare the financial statements in accordance with the small companies regime and
take advantage of the small companies' exempticn in preparing the directors’ report and from the requirement to
prepare a strategic report.

Responsibilities of directors

As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors
determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether
due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the company's ability to
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of
accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative
but to do so,

Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance
is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of
these financial statements.

The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below.

Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud

Based on our understanding of the company and industry, we identified that the principal risks of non-compliance with laws
and regulations related to breaches of FCA regulations and we considered the extent to which non-compliance may have a
material effect on the financial statements. We also considered those laws and regulations that have a direct impact on the
preparation of the financial statements such as the Companies Act 2006.

We evaluated management's incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the financial statements and the
financial report (including the risk of override of controls). and determined that the principal risks were related to posting
inappropriate entries including journals to overstate revenue or understate expenditure, and management bias in accounting
estimates.

Audit procedures performed by the engagement team included:
¢ discussions with management, including considerations of known or suspected instances of non-compliance with laws
and regulations and fraud;
evaluation of the operating effectiveness of management's controls designed to prevent and detect irregularities;
review correspondence with the FCA for evidence of breaches;
* identifying and testing journal entries.

There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above. We are less likely to become aware of instances of
non-compliance with laws and regulations that are not closely related to events and transactions reflected in the financial
statements. Also, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one
resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations,
or through collusions

Accounting policies

Company information
E.J.Markham & Son Limited is a private company limited by shares incorporated in England and Wales. The registered
office is 45 Westerham Road, Bessels Green, Sevenoaks, Kent, TN13 2QB.

Accounting convention

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 102 “The Financial Reporting Standard
applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland” (“FRS 102”) and the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 as
applicable to companies subject to the small companies regime. The disclosure requirements of section 1A of FRS 102
have been applied other than where additional disclosure is required to show a true and fair view.

The financial statements are prepared in sterling, which is the functional currency of the company. Monetary amounts
in these financial statements are rounded to the nearest £.

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention. The principal accounting policies
adopted are set out below.

Going concern

Whilst the company has continued to trade profitably in the period, the directors have prepared a going concern
assessment considering the company as part of the wider group headed by SQIB Limited. The company's forecasts
and balance sheet position may be adversely affected by developments in the wider group.

The company is therefore reliant on the support of its parent company, SQIB Limited, ultimate parent entity, Armatire
Limited and its shareholder, which has been confirmed in writing for a period of at least 12 months from the date of
approval of these financial statements. The ability of the parent entities and shareholders to provide this support is
predicated on the continued trading of its wholly owned subsidiaries in line with forecasts, securing new finance or
extending existing terms or refinancing in certain subsidiaries within the group and the sale of certain assets within the
group.

The directors have concluded that the above circumstances represent a material uncertainty that may cast significant
doubt upon the company's ability to continue as a going concern as the availability of additional funds Is not certain.
Nevertheless, after making enquiries and considering the uncertainties described above, the directors have a
reasonable expectation that the company will have adequate resources to continue operating for the foreseeable
future. Thus, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.

Turnover
‘Turnover recognised in the the profit and loss accounts represents finance charge income earned over the period of
the underlying loan agreements made principally in connection with pawn broking.

Income from the sale of gold, watches and precious stones is recorded at the point of sale and recognised when the
significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer at the point of sale.

Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost, net of depreciation and any
impairment losses.

Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost of assets less their residual values over their useful lives on the
following bases:

Fixtures and fittings 10% reducing balance / 4 years SL
Computers 10% reducing balance

1.7

1.8

Accounting policies (Continued)

The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the sale proceeds and the
carrying value of the asset, and is credited or charged to profit or loss.

Impairment of fixed assets

At each reporting period end date, the company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible assets to determine
whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the
recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is
not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the company estimates the recoverable amount
of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.

Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the
estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future
cash flows have not been adjusted.

If the recoverable amount of an asset {or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the
carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is
recognised immediately in profit or loss.

Recognised impairment losses are reversed if, and only if, the reasons for the impairment loss have ceased to apply.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is
increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed
the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or
cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.

Stocks

Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell. Cost comprises direct
materials and, where applicable, overheads that have been incurred in bringing the stocks to their present location and
condition.

At each reporting date, an assessment is made for impairment. Any excess of the carrying amount of stocks over its
estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell is recognised as an impairment loss in profit or loss. Reversals
of impairment losses are also recognised in profit or loss.

Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are basic financial assets and include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other
short-term liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts.

Financial instruments
The company has elected to apply the provisions of Section 11 ‘Basic Financial Instruments’ of FRS 102 to all of its
financial instruments.

Financial instruments are recognised in the company's balance sheet when the company becomes party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument.

Financial assets and liabilities are offset, with the net amounts presented in the financial statements, when there is a
legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to realise
the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

1.9

Accounting policies (Continued)

Basic financial assets

Basic financial assets, which include debtors and cash and bank balances, are initially measured at transaction price
including transaction costs and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method unless
the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where the transaction is measured at the present value of the
future receipts discounted at a market rate of interest. Financial assets classified as receivable within one year are not
amortised.

Classification of financial liabilities

Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements
entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the company after
deducting all of its liabilities.

Basic financial liabilities

Basic financial liabilities, including creditors and loans from fellow group companies are initially recognised at
transaction price unless the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where the debt instrument is measured at
the present value of the future payments discounted at a market rate of interest. Financial liabilities classified as
payable within one year are not amortised.

Debt instruments are subsequently carried at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.

Trade creditors are obligatians to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business
from suppliers. Amounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less. If not, they
are presented as non-current liabilities. Trade creditors are recognised initially at transaction price and subsequently
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of transaction costs. Dividends
payable on equity instruments are recognised as liabilities once they are no longer at the discretion of the company.

Employee benefits
The costs of short-term employee benefits are recognised as a liability and an expense, unless those costs are
required to be recognised as part of the cost of stock or fixed assets.

The cost of any unused holiday entitlement is recognised in the period in which the employee’s services are received.

Termination benefits are recognised immediately as an expense when the company is demonstrably committed to
terminate the employment of an employee or to provide termination benefits.

Retirement benefits
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.

Leases

Rentals payable under operating leases, including any lease incentives received, are charged to profit or loss on a
straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease except where another more systematic basis is more
representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leases asset are consumed.

2 Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty

In preparing these financial statements, the directors have made the following judgements:

Critical judgements
The following judgements have had the most significant effect on amounts recognised in the financial statements.

Stock provision

Whether a provision was required for slow moving stock items ensuring that stock is valued at the lower of cost and
estimated selling price. The director has made the judgement that no stock provision is required despite an increase in
the ageing of stock held by the company. This is based upon the fact that jewellery items sold are subject to fashion
and taste and the belief is that such items will be sold in the foreseeable future in excess of cost. Also, the company
has not resorted to reducing prices as a strategy to boost sales or shift slow moving items. Finally, the company
consistently makes a goad margin on all items sold.
