2 Accounting policies

Summary of significant accounting policies and key accounting estimates

The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have
been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.

Statement of compliance

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102 Section 1A smaller entities -

‘The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland’ and the Companies Act 2006 (as
applicable to companies subject to the small companies' regime).

Basis of preparation

These financial statements have been prepared using the historical cost convention except that as disclosed in the accounting
policies certain items are shown at fair value.

Going concern

The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.

Revenue recognition

Turnover comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and provision of services in the
ordinary course of the company’s activities. Turnover is shown net of sales/value added tax, returns, rebates and discounts.

The company recognises revenue when:

The amount of revenue can be reliably measured;

it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity;

and specific criteria have been met for each of the company's activities.

Tax
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in profit or loss, except that a change

attributable to an item of income or expense recognised as other comprehensive income is also recognised directly in other
comprehensive income.

The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by
the reporting date in the countries where the company operates and generates taxable income.

Notes to the Unaudited Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 March 2024

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences between taxable profits and profits reported in the financial
statements.

Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised when it is probable that they will be recovered against the
reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.

Deferred tax is measured using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and
that are expected to apply to the reversal of the timing difference.

Tangible assets

Tangible assets are stated in the balance sheet at cost, less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated
impairment losses.

The cost of tangible assets includes directly attributable incremental costs incurred in their acquisition and installation.

Depreciation

Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than land and properties under construction over their estimated
uscful lives, as follows:

Asset class Depreciation method and rate
Leasehold improvement 15% reducing balance

Fixtures and fittings 15% reducing balance

Motor vehicles 25% reducing balance
Computer equipment Over 3 years straight line

Investment property

Investment property is carried at fair value, derived from the current market prices for comparable real estate determined annually
by external valuers. The valuers use observable market prices, adjusted if necessary for any difference in the nature, location or
condition of the specific asset. Changes in fair value are recognised in profit or loss.

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and call deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily
convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value.

Trade debtors

Trade debtors are amounts due from customers for merchandise sold or services performed in the ordinary course of business.
Trade debtors are recognised initially at the transaction price. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the
effective interest method, less provision for impairment. A provision for the impairment of trade debtors is established when there
is objective evidence that the company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the
receivables.

Notes to the Unaudited Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 March 2024

Trade creditors

Trade creditors are obligations to pay for goods or scrviecs that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from
suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if the company does not have an unconditional right, at the end of
the reporting period, to defer scttlement of the creditor for at least twelve months after the reporting date. If there is an
unconditional right to defer settlement for at least twelve months after the reporting date, they are presented as non-current
liabilities.

Trade creditors are recognised initially at the transaction price and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective
interest method.

Borrowings

Interest-bearing borrowings are initially recorded at fair value, net of transaction costs. Interest-bearing borrowings are
subsequently carried at amortised cost, with the difference between the proceeds, net of transaction costs, and the amount due on
redemption being recognised as a charge to the profit and loss account over the period of the relevant borrowing.

Interest expense is recognised on the basis of the effective interest method and is included in interest payable and similar charges.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the company has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for
at least twelve months after the reporting date.

Leases

Leases in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases are charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.

Share capital

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Equity instruments are measured at the fair value of the cash or other resources received
or receivable, net of the direct costs of issuing the equity instruments. If payment is deferred and the time value of money is
material, the initial measurement is on a present value basis.

Dividends

Dividend distribution to the company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the reporting period
in which the dividends are declared.

Defined contribution pension obligation

A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which fixed contributions are paid into a pension fund and the company has
no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions even if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees
the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.

Contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as employee benefit expense when they are due. If contribution
payments exceed the contribution due for service, the excess is recognised as a prepayment.

3 Staff numbers

The average number of persons employed by the company (including directors) during the year, was 42 (2023 - 41).
