ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of preparing the financial statements

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102 "The Financial
Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland" including the provisions of Section 1A “Small Entities"
and the Companies Act 2006. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.

Turnover
Turnover is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, excluding discounts, rebates, value
added tax and other sales taxes.

Tangible fixed assets
Depreciation is provided at the following annual rates in order to write off each asset over its estimated useful life.

Site infrastructure - the period of the lease
Plant and machinery - 15% on cost

Fixtures and fittings - 15% on cost

Office equipment - 33% on cost
Taxation

Taxation for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Income Statement, except to the extent
that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.

Current or deferred taxation assets and liabilities are not discounted.

Current tax is recognised at the amount of tax payable using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.

Deferred tax

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet
date.

Timing differences arise from the inclusion of income and expenses in tax assessments in periods different from those in
which they are recognised in financial statements. Deferred tax is measured using tax rates and laws that have been
enacted or substantively enacted by the year end and that are expected to apply to the reversal of the timing difference.

Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that they will be
recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.

Pension costs and other post-retirement benefits

The company operates a defined contribution pension scheme. Contributions payable to the company's pension scheme
are charged to profit or loss in the period to which they relate.

EMPLOYEES AND DIRECTORS

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2024

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

On 18th April 2006 the company entered into a partnership agreement with North East Lincolnshire Council for the
operation of a skills development facility. This facility, known as CATCH, was completed in August 2006 and commenced
operations in September 2006.

The operation of the facility had been subject to a lease from North East Lincolnshire Council for 20 years under which an
annual rent is payable plus a share of the retained profits of the overall operation. The annual rent amount is subject to
periodic review. The last review was completed during 2013 and an annual rent of £75,000 pa commenced 1st April 2014
(previously £50.000 pa).

As part of it's overall strategy in ensuring it's long term viability the company has been in negotiation with North East
Lincolnshire Council to secure a new long term lease. These negotiation concluded in July 2023 and the company now has
a 35 year lease, effective from 1 April 2021. As part of these negotiations consideration has been given to a commitment
made by the company to make a financial contribution to an area of the site known 'CATCH 4'. The new lease
acknowledges this commitment and provides for an annual rent of £91,447 pa for the year to 31 March 2022, £111,447 pa
for the period to 31 March 2024 and revision pursuant to the lease thereafter.

During 2014 the company was contacted by the local Valuation Agency office to discuss the revaluation of the site for
business rates purposes. This is a complicated process due to the various extensions to the site since it was last valued
and also the fact that some areas of the site are sublet under tenancy agreements. The company has been able to come to
satisfactory agreements with both the local authority and its tenants in respect of most matters but there remains some
ongoing issues.

people with experience of industry who it is considered can add value to the decision making processes the company
undertakes. The daily management of the company is delegated to the CEO who is required to report to the board of
directors on regular basis.

members is liable to contribute an amount not exceeding £1 towards the assets of the company in the event of liquidation.
