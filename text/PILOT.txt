Accounting policies

Company information
Pilot IMS Limited is a private company limited by shares incorporated in England and Wales. The registered office is 5
Coombs Wood Court, Steelpark Road, Halesowen, B62 8BF.

Accounting convention

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 102 “The Financial Reporting Standard
applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland” (“FRS 102") and the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 as
applicable to companies subject to the small companies regime. The disclosure requirements of section 1A of FRS 102
have been applied other than where additional disclosure is required to show a true and fair view.

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention. The principal accounting policies
adopted are set out below.

Turnover

Turnover is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for services provided in the normal
course of business, and is shown net of VAT. The fair value of consideration takes into account trade discounts,
settlement discounts and volume rebates.

Revenue from the provision of services is recognised by reference to the stage of completion, when the costs incurred
and costs to complete can be estimated reliably.

Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost or valuation, net of depreciation
and any impairment losses.

Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over their useful
lives on the following bases:

Property improvements 10% on cost
Fixtures and fittings 20% on cost
Computer equipment 25% on cost
Motor vehicles 13% on reducing balance

Fixed asset investments

Interests in subsidiaries, associates and jointly controlled entities are initially measured at cost and subsequently
measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. The investments are assessed for impairment at each
reporting date and any impairment losses or reversals of impairment losses are recognised immediately in profit or loss

An associate is an entity, being neither a subsidiary nor a joint venture, in which the company holds a long-term interest
and where the company has significant influence. The company considers that it has significant influence where it has
the power to participate in the financial and operating decisions of the associate.

Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.

Accounting policies (Continued)

Current tax

The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the
profit and loss account because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years
and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The company's liability for current tax is calculated
using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting end date.

Deferred tax

Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all timing differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the
extent that it is probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable
profits. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the timing difference arises from goodwill or from the initial
recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting end date and reduced to the extent that it is
no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the
assetis realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the profit and loss account, except when it relates to items
charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are offset when the company has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and the
deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority.

Employee benefits
The cost of any unused holiday entitlement is recognised in the period in which the employee's services are received.

Retirement benefits

Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.

Leases

Rentals payable under operating leases, including any lease incentives received, are charged to profit or loss on a
straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease except where another more systematic basis is more
representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the lease asset are consumed.

Employees

The average monthly number of persons (including directors) employed by the company during the year was:
